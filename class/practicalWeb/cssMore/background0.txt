The CSS background properties are used to define the background effects for elements.

CSS background properties:

background-color
background-image
background-repeat
background-attachment
background-position


Background Color
The background-color property specifies the background color of an element.

The background color of a page is set like this:

Example
body {
    background-color: lightblue;
}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {
    background-color: lightblue;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<p>This page has a light blue background color!</p>

</body>
</html>


With CSS, a color is most often specified by:

a valid color name - like "red"
a HEX value - like "#ff0000"
an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)"
Look at CSS Color Values for a complete list of possible color values.

In the example below, the <h1>, <p>, and <div> elements have different background colors:

Example
h1 {
    background-color: green;
}

div {
    background-color: lightblue;
}

p {
    background-color: yellow;
}


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
h1 {
    background-color: green;
}

div {
    background-color: lightblue;
}

p {
    background-color: yellow;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>CSS background-color example!</h1>
<div>
This is a text inside a div element.
<p>This paragraph has its own background color.</p>
We are still in the div element.
</div>

</body>
</html>


Background Image
The background-image property specifies an image to use as the background of an element.

By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element.

The background image for a page can be set like this:

Example
body {
    background-image: url("paper.gif");
}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {
    background-image: url("paper.gif");
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<p>This page has an image as the background!</p>

</body>
</html>


Note: When using a background image, use an image that does not disturb the text.

Background Image - Repeat Horizontally or Vertically
By default, the background-image property repeats an image both horizontally and vertically.

Some images should be repeated only horizontally or vertically, or they will look strange, like this:

Example
body {
    background-image: url("gradient_bg.png");
}

If the image above is repeated only horizontally (background-repeat: repeat-x;), the background will look better:

Example
body {
    background-image: url("gradient_bg.png");
    background-repeat: repeat-x;
}


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {
    background-image: url("gradient_bg.png");
    background-repeat: repeat-x;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>Here, a backgound image is repeated only horizontally!</p>

</body>
</html>




Tip: To repeat an image vertically, set background-repeat: repeat-y;


Background Image - Set position and no-repeat
Showing the background image only once is also specified by the background-repeat property:

Example
body {
    background-image: url("img_tree.png");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
}


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {
    background-image: url("img_tree.png");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>W3Schools background image example.</p>
<p>The background image is only showing once, but it is disturbing the reader!</p>

</body>
</html>


In the example above, the background image is shown in the same place as the text. We want to change the position of the image, so that it does not disturb the text too much.

The position of the image is specified by the background-position property:

Example
body {
    background-image: url("img_tree.png");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: right top;
}




<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {
    background-image: url("img_tree.png");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: right top;
    margin-right: 200px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>W3Schools background no-repeat, set position example.</p>
<p>Now the background image is only shown once, and positioned away from the text.</p>
<p>In this example we have also added a margin on the right side, so the background image will never disturb the text.</p>

</body>
</html>





Background Image - Fixed position
To specify that the background image should be fixed (will not scroll with the rest of the page), use the background-attachment property:

Example
body {
    background-image: url("img_tree.png");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: right top;
    background-attachment: fixed;
}

Background - Shorthand property
To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the background properties in one single property. This is called a shorthand property.

The shorthand property for background is background:

Example
body {
    background: #ffffff url("img_tree.png") no-repeat right top;
}



<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {
    background: #ffffff url("img_tree.png") no-repeat right top;
    margin-right: 200px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>Now the background image is only shown once, and it is also positioned away from the text.</p>
<p>In this example we have also added a margin on the right side, so that the background image will not disturb the text.</p>

</body>
</html>



When using the shorthand property the order of the property values is:

background-color
background-image
background-repeat
background-attachment
background-position
It does not matter if one of the property values is missing, as long as the other ones are in this order.
