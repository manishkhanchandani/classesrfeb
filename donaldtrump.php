      <td valign="top"><p>Immigration</p>
      <p>Restore integrity to our immigration system by prioritizing the interests of Americans first. Enforce our immigration laws â€“ at the border and at the workplace. Build a border wall and end sanctuary cities. Send criminal aliens home. Welcome those who embrace our way of life, but keep out immigrants and refugees who don&rsquo;t through rigorous vetting.</p></td>
      <td valign="top"><p>&ldquo;They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists,&rdquo; Trump said of undocumented Mexican immigrants while announcing his candidacy last June.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;As has been stated continuously in the press, people are pouring across our borders unabated. Public reports routinely state great amounts of crime are being committed by illegal immigrants. This must be stopped and it must be stopped now.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;We're going to build the wall, and we're going to stop it. It's going to end,&rdquo; Trump said at a campaign stop in March, referring to illegal immigration.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;We want people to come into our country...legally, legally,&rdquo; Trump said.</p>
      <p>Trump argued that the U.S. has &ldquo;a dysfunctional immigration system that does not permit us to know who we let into our country.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>When Trump was asked to explain the connection between the judge's alleged bias and his ethnicity, Trump said: &ldquo;I think it has to do with perhaps the fact that I'm very, very strong on the border.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Trump reiterated his stance again Thursday night: &ldquo;We're going to bring people in, but we're going to bring people in legally.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;As president .... I would be very, very tough on the borders, and I would be not allowing certain people to come into this country without absolute perfect documentation,&rdquo; said Trump, campaigning to become the Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election that will decide on Obama's successor.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions,&rdquo; Trump added in the statement.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;We want people to come into our country but they have to come into our country legally,&rdquo; Trump said as the crowd roared its approval.</p>
      <p>When asked if he'd send 50,000 immigrants back, Trump said, &ldquo;They're going to have to go out. They can come back, but they're gonna have to go out.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;For many years, Mexico's leaders have been taking advantage of the United States by using illegal immigration to export the crime and poverty in their own country (as well as in other Latin American countries),&rdquo; Trump said.</p>
      <p>Trump said &ldquo;the word is getting out that we have to stop illegal immigration&rdquo; and called for border enforcement.</p>
      <p>In a rambling, defiant speech delivered in this border state that has been the epicenter of the nation's divisive battle over immigration reform, Trump declared: &ldquo;These are people that shouldn't be in our country. They flow in like water.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Trump said if he's elected president he will &ldquo;greatly strengthen our border, making it impenetrable, putting a stop to illegal immigration once and for all. I will bring jobs back to the United States.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>In Monday's statement, Trump doubled down on his commitment to &ldquo;strong borders&rdquo; that would keep illegal immigrants from &ldquo;pouring across our borders unabated. Public reports routinely state great amounts of crime are being committed by illegal immigrants,&rdquo; he said.</p>
      <p>And rather than emphasizing his temporary ban on all Muslim immigrants, Trump said only &ldquo;we have to stop the wrong people, we have to stop people with hate in their heart, from coming here.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;With our weakness, it's going to get much worse before it gets much better. Since 9/11, the United States had admitted half a million immigrants from countries where being gay is punishable by death,&rdquo; Trump said.</p>
      <p>Trump called for immigration reform that &ldquo;serves the interests and values of America.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;When I made my (announcement) speech at Trump Tower, the June 16 speech,&rdquo; Trump said, &ldquo;I didn't know about the Gang of Eight. ... I just knew instinctively that our borders are a mess.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;The Border Patrol is not being respected,&rdquo; Trump said.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Illegal immigration is going to stop,&rdquo; Trump said during a recent campaign stop in Arizona.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;A nation without borders is not a nation,&rdquo; Trump says on his online platform.</p>
      <p>In Tucson, Trump vowed that &ldquo;Illegal immigration is gonna stop,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;It's dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I talk about deporting people that are here illegally,&rdquo; Trump said of his immigration platform.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out, they will come back, some will come back, the best, through a process ... it may not be a very quick process, but I think that's very fair and very fine,&rdquo; said Trump.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I've talked to the greatest legal people, spoken to the greatest security people. There's absolutely no way of saying where these people come from. They may be from Syria, they may be ISIS, they may be ISIS related,&rdquo; Trump said.</p>
      <p>Defending his plan to deport 11 million illegal immigrants, Trump warned that we will &ldquo;become so politically correct as a country that we can't even walk. We can't think properly. We can't do anything.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;The border is a disaster, Bill. People are pouring in, and I mean illegal people, illegal immigrants -- 300 and some odd thousand are in your state jails right now, according to Homeland Security.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;We cannot allow illegal immigrants to pour into our country,&rdquo; he continued.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;We could increase the various border fees we charge. We could increase the fees on temporary visas. We could even impound remittance payments derived from illegal wages,&rdquo; Trump offers.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;When politicians talk about 'immigration reform' they mean: amnesty, cheap labor, and open borders,&rdquo; Trump decried.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Because people realize the problem we have I this country with illegal immigration. It's going to be solved it's going to be fixed&rdquo;, said Trump.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;We have many people coming in whose hate is equal to his and just as bad and even worse, frankly, and we have to stop people from coming in,&rdquo;Trump said on Good Morning America.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;This judge is giving us unfair rulings now I saw why. Well I am building a wall and it is a wall between Mexico not another country,&rdquo; said Trump during an interview about U.S. Federal Judge Gonzalo Curiel.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Had we had my immigration policies in effect, those people wouldn't have been in the country for the most part,&rdquo; Trump said.</p></td>

      <td valign="top"><p>Speaking in North Dakota, Trump announced his &ldquo;America First&rdquo; energy plan in which he said &ldquo;American energy dominance will be declared a strategic economic and foreign policy goal of the United States.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Trump pledged his support for the coal industry and said he supports renewable energy &ldquo;but not to the exclusion of other forms of energy that right now are working much better.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I'm in favor of nuclear energy, very strongly in favor of nuclear energy,&rdquo; Trump said.</p>
      <p>Later in his speech, Trump also stated that &ldquo;under my presidency we will accomplish complete energy independence&rdquo; and to &ldquo;imagine a world where our foes and the oil Cartels can no longer use energy as a weapon.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Regarding other extractive industries, Trump claimed that &ldquo;We're going to save the coal industry.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>In a speech earlier this year at Virginia's Radford University, Trump said, &ldquo;We're going to bring the coal industry back 100 percent.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;We have to protect your coal industry which is being decimated&rdquo; by EPA regulations, Trump added.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;We are going to bring the coal industry back 100 %&rdquo; Trump said.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Energy independence is a requirement if America is to become great again,&rdquo; Trump said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Trump suggested clean energy policies to reduce CO2 emissions would &ldquo;imperil jobs&rdquo; and &ldquo;the middle class and lower classes.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>He discounts the &ldquo;negative impact of natural gas, oil, and coal.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Make sure you mention natural gas, we're behind it 100 percent,&rdquo; Trump said his son, Eric, who was in the audience, reminded him before coming out.</p></td>
