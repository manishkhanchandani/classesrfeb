Natural Conditions

Rule
A land occupier traditionally owed no duty to others for the care of natural conditions on the occupied property. 

Explanation
An owner or occupier of land is subject to liability to a licensee for injuries sustained from a natural or artificial condition if he (1) knows of the condition, (2) realizes it involves an unreasonable risk, (3) has reason to believe the licensee will not discover the condition or risk, and (4) permits the licensee to enter or remain on the premises without exercising reasonable care to make the condition reasonably safe or warn the licensee of the condition and the risk.

As far as duties owed to persons outside the land are concerned, the land occupier has no duty of care with respect to natural conditions such as trees or rocks or other naturally existing objects. This rule only applies in rural areas. Land occupiers in urban areas owe a duty of care to prevent trees growing on their land from creating unreasonable risks of harm to pedestrians on public streets.

Example:
Noxious Weeds -- am I liable for noxious weeds that spread from my land to your land?

Common law -- no liability for spread of weeds.
"At common law, landowners were not liable for the natural spread of weeds from their property to their neighbors' property. Landowners, however, could be held liable if the spread of weeds resulted from some independent act of negligence... [T]here is a duty to use ordinary care when attempting to control or remove weeds.




Res Ipsa Loquitur

Rule
Res Ipsa Loquitur is a rule of evidence which aids the plaintiff in proving the element of breach of duty when the plaintiff is unable to establish by other evidence that the defendant acted unreasonably.

Explanation
Res ipsa loquitur is Latin, and when translated directly means the thing speaks for itself. Under the common law of negligence, the res ipsa loquitur doctrine indicates that a breach of a party's duty of care may be inferred from the events that occurred.

Example
The classic example is the person who has an operation, has her appendix removed, and then some time after the operation she still has pain in her stomach, goes back to the doctor, takes an x-ray and sees that the scalpel, or the surgical knife, was still inside of her when she was sewn up. This is a clear case of res ipsa loquitur. There is no reason other than negligence that a doctor would sew a scalpel into somebody’s stomach. So this would mean that if she were to sue the doctor or the hospital, all she would have to put into evidence was the fact that there was a scalpel sewn up in her stomach. That would be enough to imply that there was negligence and it would shift the burden of proof to the defendant in this case, the doctor or the hospital, to prove that there was some other non-negligent reason for leaving that scalpel in her stomach.






Actual Cause or Cause in Fact
An actual cause is the cause which starts, ignites or makes possible the result which follows, and which satisfies the “But For” or Substantial Factor Test.


Explanation
Actual cause, also known as “cause in fact,” is straightforward. When a bus strikes a car, the bus driver’s actions are the actual cause of the accident. 
 
Proximate Cause
An actual cause of harm is the proximate cause of that harm if the act occurs in a natural and continuous sequence of events, unbroken by unforeseeable, independent, intervening acts and results in the harm.

Explanation
Proximate cause means “legal cause,” or one that the law recognizes as the primary cause of the injury. It may not be the first event that set in motion a sequence of events that led to an injury, and it may not be the very last event before the injury occurs. Instead, it is an action that produced foreseeable consequences without intervention from anyone else. In other words, the plaintiff will have to show that the injuries were the natural and direct consequence of the proximate cause, without which the injuries would not have occurred.


Independent Intervening Act
An independent intervening act is one which would have occurred even in the absence of the original negligence. 

Explanation

An independent intervening force is one that operates upon the situation created by the defendant’s negligence, but which is not a direct response or reaction to the negligence. Such forces may be acts of third persons or acts of God. Where an independent intervening force occurs, the defendant will remain liable for the foreseeable results of his act. 

For example:

Ishmael negligently hits Ahab with his car. Ahab, who is severely injured, is taken to the hospital where he is operated on. During the operation, bacteria in the air enters Ahab’s surgical incisions and Ahab suffers a severe infection. Since it is reasonably foreseeable that Ahab’s surgical incisions may become infected, Ishmael will be held liable for the infection.

However, if the force is an intentionally tortious or criminal act, the defendant will not be held liable. This is because, ordinarily, criminal acts on the part of others are not reasonably foreseeable.

If the defendant’s negligence, however, has created a situation in which a reasonable person would have foreseen that negligent, intentional or even criminal acts might be committed by others, then those acts are considered foreseeable intervening forces and they will not excuse defendant from liability.

For example:

Ishmael owns an apartment building in a high crime neighborhood. Ishmael fails to properly install locks on the entrances to the common areas of the building. Ahab is mugged in the lobby of the building. Ishmael may be held liable for Ahab’s injuries because, given the nature of the neighborhood, it is foreseeable that someone could be attacked if the building was not properly secure.

However, where a third person’s criminal or tortious conduct was not reasonably foreseeable and the defendant’s conduct has not enhanced the risk that the criminal action will occur, the defendant may be insulated from liability. For example:

Ishmael, a crew member on a whaling ship, negligently fails to properly seal the fuel tanks on the ship. The result is that the ship’s hull fills with gasoline fumes. Later that day, Ahab, a fire-bug, sets fire to the ship. The fumes are ignited and the ship explodes. Here, Ishmael may be insulated from liability. If he had no reason to expect Ahab’s intentionally tortious or criminal act and Ishmael’s negligence did not give rise to the act or enhance the risk that such an act would occur, he is not liable even though the resulting harm was foreseeable.

The rationale for this is that the guilt of the criminal whose misconduct was intentional or reckless overwhelms the responsibility of the defendant who was merely negligent.

Please note that we are talking here about unforeseeable criminal or tortious acts. A third person’s negligent conduct, even it was unforeseeable, does not relieve the defendant of liability if it causes a result similar to that threatened by the defendant’s conduct. Only intentionally tortious or criminal actions will relieve the defendant of liability. For example:

Ishmael negligently builds a brick wall. The wall falls down injuring Ahab, but only after Bartleby has crashed into the wall with his car. In this case, Ishmael will be held liable for Ahab’s injuries because the wall’s falling and injuring Ahab, a passerby, is a foreseeable result of Ishmael’s original negligence. The fact that the wall falling was brought about by Bartleby’s negligent driving will not insulate Ishmael from liability.

However, if the third person’s negligence was highly extraordinary under the circumstances (in other words more than just unforeseeable) then the defendant will be insulated from liability.

In a situation where a defendant commits an act of negligence that injures a plaintiff and a third person is in a position to save the plaintiff but does nothing, the third person’s failure to prevent the harm is not considered an intervening act. Therefore, the failure of a third person to act does not insulate the defendant from liability even if the third person is under a legal duty to act. For example:

(1) Ishmael pushes Ahab into a swimming pool. Ahab begins to drown. Bartleby, another swimmer, is in a position to save Ahab but does nothing. Even though Bartleby could have saved Ahab from the harm he suffered, Ishmael will still be held liable for Ahab’s injuries.
(2) Ishmael negligently pushes Ahab into a swimming pool. Ahab begins to drown. Bartleby, a lifeguard, is in a position and under a legal obligation to go to Ahab’s rescue but does nothing. Although Bartleby was in a position to save Ahab and although Bartleby had a legal obligation to go to Ahab’s rescue, Ishmael will nevertheless be held liable for Ahab's injuries.

As far as unforeseeable results produced by foreseeable intervening forces are concerned, there is essentially a split in the authorities. Even though the intervening force may be foreseeable, some courts will not hold the defendant liable if the result was unforeseeable. However, other courts will nevertheless impose liability.

If, however, both the intervening forces and their results are unforeseeable, all courts hold that the defendant is not liable.
 
 
 
Dependent Intervening Act
A dependent intervening act is one which would not have occurred in the absence of the original negligence. 

Explanation

A dependent intervening force is an act of a third person that is considered a normal response to the situation created by the defendant’s negligence. Since such forces arise directly because of the defendant’s negligence they are considered foreseeable and will not relieve the defendant of liability. There are four types of dependent intervening forces:

1) checking forces,
2) rescue forces, 
3) escape forces and,
4) other response forces.

Checking forces essentially have to do with careless medical treatment that a plaintiff receives as a result of a defendant’s negligence. For example:

Ishmael negligently hits Ahab with his car. Ahab is rushed to the hospital and is sent into surgery. During the course of the operation, the surgeon is careless and causes Ahab more injuries.

In situations like this, the doctor’s carelessness represents a dependant intervening act. However, it is considered foreseeable that a plaintiff would need medical care as a result of a defendant’s negligence. It is also considered foreseeable that the medical care would be administered carelessly. Therefore, the defendant would be liable for both the harm he inflicted on the plaintiff himself and for the harm the plaintiff suffered in the hospital.

Thus, in our example, Ishmael would be liable for both the harm he inflicted on Ahab himself and for the harm Ahab suffered as a result of the doctor’s carelessness.

Please note that this does not apply where medical care was performed recklessly or where medical malpractice was committed deliberately. In such a case, the intervening act is certainly not considered "forseeable". For example:

If the surgeon operated on Ahab while drunk, Ishmael would not be held liable for that. 

The second type of dependent intervening force is rescue forces. For example:

Ishmael negligently pushes Ahab into a river. Bartleby sees that Ahab has fallen into the river and attempts to go to Ahab’s aid. Bartleby goes about trying to rescue Ahab as carefully as he can but he accidentally injures Ahab during the rescue attempt anyway. Because “danger invites rescue” it is considered foreseeable that someone would come to Ahab’s aid after Ishmael pushed him into the river. It is also foreseeable that the rescue attempt would cause Ahab further harm. Therefore, Ishmael is liable both for the injuries he caused Ahab directly and for whatever injuries Bartleby might have unintentionally inflicted upon him.

The third kind of dependent intervening force is escape forces. For example:

Ishmael negligently sets a fire in an apartment building. The fire causes a panic and residents rush to try to escape the burning building. In the rush to get out, Ahab is knocked to the ground and trampled by the other residents. According to the law, it is foreseeable that individuals threatened with harm will try to escape. It is also foreseeable that those efforts to escape may endanger others. Therefore, Ishmael is held liable for Ahab’s injuries, even though they were caused by the escaping crowd.

The fourth kind of dependent intervening force is response forces and other reactions by both humans and animals that the law considers foreseeable. For example:

While Ahab is riding a horse, Ishmael fires a gun and startles the horse. The horse rears up and throws Ahab off of its back. If Ahab is injured, Ishmael will be held liable for those injuries since the horse’s reaction to being startled is considered normal and, thus, foreseeable.

Please remember that the most important requirement in all dependent intervening force cases is that the response to the situation created by defendant’s negligence must be considered normal. If the response is unusual or abnormal it is not considered a dependent intervening force and the defendant will not be held liable for the results of those abnormal reactions.


 
The "But For" Test
The "But For" Test is used to establish actual cause. To apply the test, the plaintiff must show that but for the defendant's act, the plaintiff would not have been injured.

Explanation
Some states follow the “but for” rule to determine if an event is the proximate cause. This rule considers whether the injury would not have happened but for the defendant’s negligent action or omission. When there is a finding that an injury would not have happened but for a defendant’s action, it establishes the element of proximate cause.

For example, when a drunk driver is weaving in and out of traffic and hits a pedestrian, causing massive hemorrhaging and brain damage, the accident would not have happened but for the drunk driver’s intoxication. It is foreseeable that if a driver is drunk and weaving through traffic, he or she may cause injuries to a pedestrian. However, a defendant cannot be liable for totally unforeseeable injuries. If the same drunk driver hits a warehouse full of explosives, and there is an explosion that causes drivers to rubberneck and hit the pedestrian, the drunk driving is probably not the proximate cause of the pedestrian’s injuries.
 
The "Substantial Factor"Test
The Substantial Factor Test is used to establish actual cause where more than one act contributes to the plaintiff’s harm. 


Explanation
Other states use the “substantial factor” test in connection with proximate cause. Under this rule, the court will consider whether the defendant’s actions or omissions were a substantial factor in causing the injury. In jurisdictions that follow the substantial factor test, a substantial factor is one that contributes materially to the occurrence of an injury. An action contributes materially when its causative effects are in operation until the moment of injury. An act or omission that only trivially affects the occurrence of an injury is not a substantial factor and will not be considered a proximate cause.

For example, if a distracted driver crashes into a truck carrying explosives, and as a result, the explosives explode and kill the truck driver, the distracted driving is a substantial factor in the accident. The distracted driver’s actions are in operation until the truck explodes. However, if a distracted driver crashes into a stop sign and in order to avoid the site of the accident, a tractor-trailer driver turning left swings particularly wide such that the portion of the truck carrying explosives hits a parked car and explodes, killing a passing pedestrian, the distracted driver’s actions affected the pedestrian’s death only incidentally, whereas the truck driver’s swinging wide turn is a substantial factor in his or her death.














Invasion of Privacy
Rule
Generally, causes of action for invasion of privacy relates to the violation of one's right to be let alone. One of four theories must be charged: appropriation of likeness, intrusion upon seclusion, public disclosure of private facts, or false light.

Explanation
Let's say you accidentally leave a personal letter containing private information on a public park bench, and that letter is picked up and read by someone else. Even if the sharing of this information damages your reputation or causes other harm, it is not a violation of your privacy. That requires a "reasonable expectation" of privacy, which would apply if the letter was not left out in public. But if you are having a private conversation in your home and a neighbor uses an electronic device to eavesdrop (and this causes some kind of injury), then your expectation of privacy has in fact been violated.

Therefore, an invasion of privacy occurs when there is an intrusion upon your reasonable expectation to be left alone.

Example
Example: A man with binoculars regularly climbs a tree in his yard and watches a woman across the street undress through her bathroom window. Her injury is the emotional distress she suffers upon seeing the perpetrator looking at her. 


 
Malicious Prosecution
Rule
Malicious Prosecution is a cause of action against a defendant who previously filed criminal or civil proceedings against the plaintiff without probable cause and with malice. The original proceeding must have ended in favor of the party who is now suing for malicious prosecution.

Explanation
When a person files a civil lawsuit, or a prosecutor brings criminal charges against an individual without good cause, maliciously, or for an inappropriate reason, the defendant may have the right to seek justice by filing a malicious prosecution lawsuit against him. Malicious prosecution is a “tort,” which means that it is a specific wrongdoing for which a person may sue the wrongdoer for forcing him to defend himself in the original case.

Malicious prosecution occurs when one party has knowingly and with malicious intent initiated baseless litigation against another party. 
 
Example
Marty, a county prosecutor, is running for mayor in his town. When he loses the election, he strongly believes a successful businessman in the area sabotaged his campaign. As lead prosecutor in the town, Marty charges the man with attempting to bribe public officials. The man’s attorney discovers that Marty has no actual evidence that points to his client’s guilt, and presses to have the charges dropped.

Over the course of several months until the charges are dropped, the man had paid over $5,000 in attorney’s fees, and the accusations cause him to lose business. The man files a civil lawsuit against Marty for malicious prosecution. He argues that Marty had abused the legal system, as well as his authority as a prosecutor, for the purpose of damaging his reputation. The businessman asks the court to award him damages for his losses, including his attorney’s fees, and loss of reputation.



 
Abuse of Process
Rule
Under tort law, a person is liable for abuse of process if he previously initiated a legal proceeding against the plaintiff, with an ulterior motive, and for an improper purpose.

Explanation
Abuse of process is an intentional tort that arises when a person deliberately misuses a court process that is not justified by the underlying civil or criminal legal action. As with most torts, the elements that a plaintiff must prove in order to win his or her case will vary from state to state.

The term ‘process’ refers to the proceedings in any civil lawsuit or criminal prosecution and, particularly, describes the formal notice or writ used by a court to exercise jurisdiction over a person or property.  Such process compels the receiver to come to court, or comply with an order of the Court.  It may take the form of a summons, mandate, subpoena, warrant, or other written demand issued by a court.

Abuse of process refers to the improper use of a civil or criminal legal procedure for an unintended, malicious, or perverse reason.  It is the malicious and deliberate misuse of regularly issued civil or criminal court process that is not justified by the underlying legal action.  Abuse of process includes litigation actions in bad faith that are meant to delay the delivery of justice.  

Examples include serving legal papers on someone which have not actually been filed with the intent to intimidate, or filing a lawsuit without a genuine legal basis in order to obtain information, force payment through fear of legal entanglement or gain an unfair or illegal advantage.


 
Disparagement
Disparagement, or trade libel, is the publication of an untrue or misleading statement about another’s business or product in an attempt to influence a person not to deal with the business.

Explanation
In short, there are six elements to the tort of disparagement: (1) intentional and (2) unprivileged (3) publication of (4) a false statement that (5) disparages the property of another (6) in a manner that can be measured.


Example
The defendant, upon learning that the plaintiff was trying to sell his home, placed a large sign on adjoining land which read in part: "Notice. Anyone buying No. 20 Malibu is buying [a] law suit. Anyone renting or using main house or garage will be sued for rent. Title clouded rt. sides wall, foundation mine.". As a result, the plaintiff was unable to sell the house.


 
Interference With an Economic Relation
Interference with Economic Relationship is a broad cause of action alleging an intentional interference with one's business relationships. 
 
Explanation
The unlawful means tort allows a plaintiff to sue a defendant for economic loss resulting from the defendant's unlawful act against a third party. In order to found liability to the plaintiff, the defendant must use unlawful means and the defendant must intend to harm the plaintiff through the use of the unlawful means.

Example
The 1793 case of Tarleton v. M'Gawley (1793) serves as an example of the tort: the defendant, the master of a trading ship, fired its cannons at a canoe that was attempting to trade with its competitor, the plaintiffs' trading ship, in order to prevent it from doing so. The plaintiffs were able to recover damages for the economic injury resulting from the defendant's wrongful conduct toward third parties (the occupants of the canoe) which had been committed with the intention of inflicting economic injury on the plaintiffs.


General Damages
Rule
General damages are non-pecuniary in nature and are presumed by the law to be incurred based upon the commission of the tort. General damages need not be specifically claimed and proved. Examples are pain, suffering and inconvenience.

Explanation
General damages flow naturally from the defendant's wrongful action.  There is a clear link between the defendant's behavior and the plaintiff's injury. In most cases, the ability of the defendant to anticipate the injury (or the severity of the harm) does not bar the plaintiff from receiving full compensation for his or her general damages. For example, let’s assume that Driver A is the at-fault driver in a seemingly minor car accident with Driver B, who has a rare bone condition which severely aggravates bodily injuries. Driver A is liable for all of Driver B’s general damages, even if a person without the rare bone condition might not have suffered any significant level of general damages. Another way of saying this is, when it comes to general damages, as a defendant "you take the plaintiff as you find him (or her)."  
Types of General Damages.
While every personal injury case will look a little different, general damages can include:
physical pain and suffering
physical disfigurement
physical impairment
mental anguish
loss of companionship (paid to family members in wrongful death cases), and
lowered qualify of life. 
Calculating General Damages.
It may be difficult to calculate or precisely quantify the amount of money necessary to compensate the injured person for general damages. Determining general damages often involves assigning an exact dollar amount to a subjective injury. Damages such as mental anguish or embarrassment are unique to each plaintiff. Factors that may determine a damage award include the gruesomeness of an injury, the skill of the attorneys, and the sensitivities of the jury. Because of these imprecise factors, damage awards in seemingly similar personal injury cases often vary.


 
Punitive or Exemplary Damages
Rule
Punitive damages, also called exemplary damages, are awarded to the plaintiff for the purpose of punishing the defendant for malicious or reckless conduct. The intent is to make an “example” of the defendant's conduct so that such conduct will not be repeated.

Explanation
Also referred to as “exemplary damages,” punitive damages are awarded only in special cases where the acts of the defendant are found to be egregious, intentional, and especially harmful. Punitive damages are awarded for the express purpose of punishing the defendant, and to deter future similar acts, rather than to enrich the plaintiff. Generally speaking, punitive damages are not awarded in contract cases, unless it is proven one party has acted with the intent to defraud the other party.

Example
In this well-publicized 1992 case, 79-year old Stella Liebeck spilled a cup of McDonald’s coffee in her lap, sustaining third degree burns to both legs. The severity of the full-thickness burns required skin grafts. When McDonald’s denied Liebeck’s request to pay her medical bills, she filed a lawsuit.

During the course of the case, it was discovered McDonald’s had received hundreds of other complaints from customers complaining that their coffee had caused severe burns, and that the corporation’s operations manual specified the coffee was to be kept at 180-190 degrees Fahrenheit. It is known that liquid at that temperature, if spilled onto a person, causes third degree burns in three to seven seconds.

A jury awarded Liebeck $200,000 in compensatory damages to pay for medical bills and other related expenses. Because it was clear the company knew their coffee was dangerous and could cause serious injury, yet did nothing to rectify the situation, the jury also awarded Liebeck $2.7 million in punitive damages, which amounted to the company’s sales revenue from just two days of coffee sales.



 
Out of Pocket Damages (Misrepresentation)
Rule
Out of Pocket damages are usually considered to be the same thing as special damages since they are pecuniary in nature. However, in an action for misrepresentation, out-of pocket damages are calculated by comparing the difference between what the plaintiff paid, to the value of what the plaintiff received.

Explanation
The ‘out-of-pocket’ measure of damages ‘is directed to restoring the plaintiff to the financial position enjoyed by him prior to the fraudulent transaction, and thus awards the difference in actual value at the time of the transaction between what the plaintiff gave and what he received. 


 
Loss of the Benefit of the Bargain
Under the Loss of the Benefit of the Bargain Theory, special damages for misrepresentation are calculated by considering the value received by the plaintiff as compared to the value that the defendant stated the plaintiff would receive.
 
Explanation
Benefit of the bargain rule is a principle that any party who breaches a contract must pay the aggrieved party an amount that puts that person in the same financial position that would have resulted if the contract had been fully performed. It also refers to the principle that a defrauded buyer may recover from the seller as damages the difference between the misrepresented value of the property and the actual value received. It is one of methods of measuring damages in cases involving fraud.

Example
The following are examples of caselaw on the rule:

Damages under the "benefit-of-the-bargain" rule for fraud by an insurer are calculated by taking the difference between the actual value of the policy and its value had the contested facts been true. 
















Duty Owed to Licensee
Duty land occupier owes to the licensee of warning of known dangerous conditions, unless they are obvious. The licensee assumes the risk of obvious dangers and those of which he or she is aware. While the land occupier has the option of avoiding liability by correcting the dangerous condition, he or she owes no duty to do so and need only give an adequate warning that the condition exists.
 
Duty Owed to a Trespasser
The land occupier generally owes no duty of care to the trespasser unless the trespasser is a constant trespasser upon a limited area or a child to whom the Attractive Nuisance Doctrine applies.
 
Duty Owed to the Child Trespasser
The land occupier owes no duty to a child trespasser unless he is a constant trespasser upon a limited area or unless the case is one in which the Attractive Nuisance Doctrine applies.
 
Attractive Nuisance Doctrine
The Attractive Nuisance Doctrine, recognized in most jurisdictions, imposes a duty upon land occupiers for the protection of young children whose trespasses are to be anticipated and whose immaturity renders them particularly susceptible to injury from dangerous conditions on the land.
 
Duty Owed to Persons Off the Premises
The land occupier owes a duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition for the protection of passersby and occupiers of adjoining premises.


Negligence Per Se
Under the doctrine of negligence per se, the elements of duty and breach are proved when a defendant violates a safety statute which was intended to protect the class of people to which the plaintiff belongs from the kind of injury the defendant caused. 
 
Contributory Negligence
Under the minority doctrine of contributory negligence, if the plaintiff’s failure to exercise reasonable care for his own safety is a contributing factor to his own injury, he is barred from recovery for the defendant’s negligent action.
 
Comparative Negligence
Modernly, the doctrine of comparative negligence has replaced contributory negligence, so that liability is apportioned according to the relative degrees of fault of the plaintiff and defendant.
 
The Doctrine of Avoidable Consequence
Under the Doctrine of Avoidable Consequences, a plaintiff must act reasonably to mitigate his or her damages. If the plaintiff fails to act reasonably to minimize his loss or injury, the amount of damages he or she recovers may be reduced.
 
Last Clear Chance Doctrine
The last clear chance doctrine limits the contributory negligence defense so that even if the plaintiff was contributorily negligent, he will be permitted to recover if the defendant had a superior opportunity to avoid the accident and failed to do so.
 
Assumption of the Risk
Under the defense of assumption of the risk, a plaintiff assumes the risk of harm if he voluntarily subjects himself to a known and appreciated risk.
 
Vicarious Liability
Under the theory of vicarious liability, a defendant who is not charged with personal fault or wrongdoing may be held liable for the tortfeasor’s act because of the defendant’s relationship to the tortfeasor. (e.g., the defendant is an employer, joint venturer, car owner, bailor, parent, etc.) A defendant who is held vicariously liable has the right to indemnification by the tortfeasor.
 
Joint Tortfeasors
Joint tortfeasors consist of two or more persons who join together to commit a tortious act. Their status is similar to that of co-conspirators in criminal law, and each is vicariously liable for the acts done by the other in the furtherance of the common design.
 
Concurrent Tortfeasors
Concurrent tortfeasors consist of two or more persons who are not acting in concert with each other but whose acts combine to produce a single indivisible injury to the plaintiff. 

 two or more persons whose negligence in a single accident or event causes damages to another person. In many cases the joint tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for the damages, meaning that any of them can be responsible to pay the entire amount, no matter how unequal the negligence of each party was. Example: Harry Hotrod is doing 90 miles an hour along a two-lane road in the early evening, Adele Aimster has stopped her car to study a map with her car sticking out into the lane by six inches. Hotrod swings out a couple of feet to miss Aimster's vehicle, never touches the brake, and hits Victor Victim, driving from the other direction, killing him. While Hotrod is grossly negligent for the high speed and failure to slow down, Aimster is also negligent for her car's slight intrusion into the lane. As a joint tortfeasor she may have to pay all the damages, particularly if Hotrod has no money or insurance. However, comparative negligence rules by statute or case law in most jurisdictions will apportion the liability by percentages of negligence among the tortfeasors (wrongdoers) and the injured party's. 
 
Successive Tortfeasors
A successive tortfeasor is one whose negligence follows an initial injury and adds to, or aggravates, the existing injury. 
For example:

Fred loses control of his car and hits Barney while Barney is walking across the street. Barney is injured in the accident. Two weeks later, Kazoo loses control of his car and hits Barney while Barney is crossing the street. Barney’s original injuries are worsened by this new accident. Fred and Kazoo are considered successive tortfeasors. That is to say, they each caused damage to Barney although their negligent actions were unrelated. Although Fred and Kazoo are each responsible only for the portion of the injuries that they caused, the burden of allocating that causation is placed on them. In other words, although Fred and Kazoo will only be responsible for the injuries that they caused to Barney themselves, it is up to each of them to prove the extent of the injuries that they inflicted.
 
Joint and Several Liability
Joint and several liability is imposed upon joint and concurrent (but not successive) tortfeasors. This means that each is responsible for the full amount of the plaintiff's injury and the full amount of a related court judgment. 

When two or more parties are jointly and severally liable for a tortious act, each party is independently liable for the full extent of the injuries stemming from the tortious act. Thus, if a plaintiff wins a money judgment against the parties collectively, the plaintiff may collect the full value of the judgment from any one of them. That party may then seek contribution from the other wrong-doers.

For example suppose that A, B, and C negligently injure V. V successfully sues A, B, and C, for $1,000,000. If the court used a joint and several liability system, V could demand that A pay V the full $1,000,000. A could them demand contribution from B and C. However, if B or C could not pay, A would be stuck paying the full $1,000,000.

Joint and several liability reduces plaintiffs' risk that one or more defendants are judgment-proof by shifting that risk onto the other defendants. Only if all defendants are judgment-proof will a plaintiff be unable to recover anything. However, this system can cause inequities, particularly where a relatively blameless defendant is forced to bear the financial burden of an incredibly guilty co-defendant's insolvency.
 
Contribution
Contribution relates to a claim by one concurrent tortfeasor against another concurrent tortfeasor, requesting reimbursement of the other’s proportional share of a court judgment. 
 
Indemnity
Indemnity is a shifting of the liability from a defendant who is only secondarily or vicariously liable to the party who is primarily liable. 
 
Husband-Wife Immunity
Rule
At common law, husband-wife immunity prevented one spouse from maintaining an action against the other.

Explanation
Under the common law, husbands and wives were considered one legal entity and thus, could not sue each other. However, almost all jurisdictions have done away with this idea of a single legal entity and now allow husbands and wives to sue each other.

Example
On July 15, 1991 defendant-appellee, Michael Beattie ("Husband"), struck the back of a slow moving truck engaged in weed spraying operations on the median of Route 1 near Milford, Delaware. At the time of the collision he was driving a 1991 Oldsmobile Cutlass in which his wife, plaintiff-appellant, Margaret Beattie ("Wife"), was a passenger. His wife sustained serious injuries in the accident which have rendered her a quadriplegic. Her medical bills and expenses are in excess of $286,000. On December 17, 1991, Wife filed a negligence action against her Husband.[1] At the time of the accident, he was covered by a substantial liability insurance policy on the vehicle. Despite the suit, the Beatties have remained married and have no plans to divorce.
 
 

 
Parent-Child Immunity
Rule
Traditionally parent-child immunity has been applied so that a parent and minor child are immune from suits against each other in tort action. 

Explanation
Further, under the common law, children were barred from suing their parents for personal torts but were allowed to sue their parents for torts committed against the child’s property. Today, most jurisdictions have done away with immunity, except for where a child is bringing a negligence cause of action against his parents. Thus, a child can sue his parents for intentional torts but not for acts of negligence. 

Example
Gina Bigelow (Gina), by and through her mother, Carron Bigelow (Bigelow), filed a complaint in which she alleged that her mother's negligent operation of a car resulted in painful and disabling physical and mental injuries and suffering. She demanded a judgment of $300,000.

Bigelow filed an "Answer" on November 8, 1989, denying all the material allegations of the complaint and alleging, affirmatively, that the complaint failed to state a cause of action as she was immune from suit.


Governmental Immunity
Rule
Governmental immunity has been applied to prevent suits against a governmental entity unless that entity has consented to the suit. 

Explanation
The origin of governmental immunity lies in the common law where state and federal governments had sovereign immunity that insulated them from liability. However, many jurisdictions today have done away with governmental immunity.
 
Further, the Federal Tort Claims Act has eliminated immunity for negligence or wrongful acts or omissions and some intentional torts committed by government employees. However, immunity is retained for some intentional torts, strict liability and for discretionary acts by government employees. Discretionary acts are defined as acts that the employee has the option to either do or not do. This is opposed to ministerial acts, which are acts the employee has no choice but to do. Federal employees are immune from liability for ministerial acts. 
 
Charitable Immunity
Rule
Charitable immunity traditionally prevented non-paying recipients from suing a charity.

Explanation
The root of the charitable immunity lies in the common law as well. The rationale was that the budgets of charitable organizations were made up of donations and that, if charitable organizations had to pay tort claims, the money that people donated would not be put toward the purpose they had intended it for. 

Today, most jurisdictions have eliminated the charitable immunity, reasoning that the need to compensate victims of torts committed by charities outweighed the need to protect the intent of charitable donors. However, there are some states that allow plaintiffs to sue charitable organizations for tort liability but limit the recovery that charitable organizations must pay out.

 
Wrongful Death Statutes
 
Survival Statutes
Survival statutes allow a decedent’s pre-existing cause of action against another to continue after the death of the parties originally involved.
 
Wrongful Birth
Wrongful birth actions have been accepted in an increasing number of jurisdictions. They usually relate to a claim of negligence against a physician or laboratory related to the failure to supply information concerning potential birth defects or claimed negligence involved in the failure to prevent birth by contraception, abortion, vasectomy, etc.
 
Pre-Natal Injuries
At common law, pre-natal injuries could not be the basis of a suit by a child against a tortfeasor. It is now generally held that the child, if born alive, should not be denied a cause of action merely because the injury occurred prior to birth.
 
Negligent Supervision
Negligent supervision is a cause of action which is brought by a plaintiff who suffered injury because a child or other person was inadequately supervised by one who owed a duty of supervision.
 
Strict Liability
Rule
Strict liability is liability without fault. It is imposed against a defendant even though the defendant has done nothing intentionally wrong and has not acted unreasonably under the circumstances. 

Explanation
Liability that does not depend on actual negligence but that is based on the breach of an absolute duty to make something safe.
Strict liability differs from ordinary negligence because strict liability establishes liability without fault. In other words, when a defendant is held strictly liable for harm caused to the plaintiff, he is held liable simply because the injury happened. The fact that the harm that the plaintiff suffered is not the defendant’s fault makes no difference.

Strict liability for negligence typically involves cases where the plaintiff was injured either by the defendant’s animal or by an abnormally dangerous activity that the defendant had undertaken. For example:

David stores highly flammable propane tanks on his property. Lightening strikes, setting the tanks on fire. The fire goes on to damage Saul's property. Although lightening strikes are an act of God and are not in any way David's fault, he is liable under the rules of strict liability simply because Saul suffered harm.

The elements required for establishing a case of strict liability are the same duty, breach, cause, and harm elements required for establishing a case of ordinary negligence.

The one difference between ordinary negligence and strict liability involves the nature of the duty owed to the plaintiff. In ordinary negligence, the duty owed is the duty of due care. For strict liability, the duty owed is the duty to avoid causing the plaintiff any harm.
 
Rylands v. Fletcher
Under the landmark English case of Rylands v. Fletcher, one who brings something onto his land which is non-natural and likely to cause injury if it escapes, is strictly liable for all damages resulting from an escape.
 
Products Liability
Under tort law, a manufacturer or seller who releases an unreasonably dangerous product into the stream of commerce is liable for harm caused by the product.
 
MacPherson v. Buick
In the landmark case of MacPherson v. Buick, Justice Cardozo dispensed with the previously applied requirement of privity of contract in products liability cases and extended the manufacturer's duty of care to include the ultimate consumer of the product, whether or not the consumer was the actual purchaser of the product.
 
Products Liability (Negligence)
Rule
In order for a plaintiff to recover under a negligence theory of products liability, the plaintiff must prove duty, breach, causation, and damages. A duty of care originally extended only to those in privity of contract, but under McPherson v. Buick, the duty was extended to all foreseeable users. To establish breach, the plaintiff must show that the product failed to meet ordinary commercial expectations. Damages are limited to personal and property.

Explanation
Products Liability:
A manufacturer’s or seller’s tort liability for any damages or injuries suffered by a buyer, user or bystander as a result of a defective product.

Cases involving manufacturers or suppliers intentionally placing dangerous products into the stream of commerce are relatively rare. The more common scenario is where manufacturers and suppliers are sued for unintentional injuries their products have caused.

The general rule regarding these negligence cases is that if it is reasonably foreseeable that a product will create a risk of death or injury to a plaintiff if the product is not carefully made or supplied, the manufacturer and supplier have a duty to carefully manufacture and supply the product. Further, now that the concept of privity does not apply, this duty is owed to any foreseeable user of the product. 

Over the years the courts have extended this general rule. For example, while the general rule creates a duty of care in manufacturing and supplying the product, the courts have extended this to include a duty of care in designing the product as well. Also, while the general rule dictates that the duty of care is owed to all foreseeable users of the product, the courts have extended this to include all plaintiffs foreseeably within the scope of use of the product. 

For example:
Bill purchases some fireworks from a local dealer. As Bill is walking home with his purchase, the fireworks, which are defective, explode, injuring Bill and injuring Al, a pedestrian who is walking on the other side of the street. Under the general rule, Al probably could not sue the fireworks manufacturer because he was not a foreseeable user of the product. However, under the case law establishing that the duty of care extends to all plaintiffs foreseeably within the scope of use of the product, Al will be able to sue the fireworks manufacturer.
 
Products Liability (Breach of Warranty)
Liability can be imposed against the manufacturer or seller of a product based upon the buyer's reliance upon an express or implied warranty that the goods are of merchantable quality or are fit for their intended purpose.
 
Products Liability (Strict Liability)
Strict liability may be imposed against a manufacturer or seller of a product which is defective and thereby unsafe for its anticipated use, or for failure to warn the consumer of an inherent danger involved in the use of the product when put to an intended or foreseeable use. 

"Strict" Liability Means the Defendant’s Behavior Does Not Matter

Ordinarily in proving fault in an injury case, the defendant’s standard of conduct is essential. For a defendant to be liable, he or she must generally have behaved in a manner that falls below the conduct expected of the average, reasonable person.
However, strict liability rules -- like the one applied to strict products liability cases -- does away with the analysis of whether the defendant’s conduct met a certain standard. The strict product liability rule came to replace standard negligence rules in most states because it became clear that plaintiffs, who were injured by defective products through no fault of their own, often could not win their cases.
This was happening because it was too difficult to prove that the manufacturer behaved below a certain standard, or that nothing else caused the defect. Courts and state legislatures recognized that it was bad public policy to make innocent plaintiffs suffer the loss when products were defective, so strict products liability rules were enacted as law.
 
Misrepresentation
Under contract law, misrepresentation occurs when one party to a contract intentionally, negligently, or even innocently makes a false statement of material fact, misleads the other by telling a half truth or by acting to conceal the truth, or has a fiduciary duty to the other party and fails to disclose a material fact.
 
Deceit
The action or practice of deceiving someone by concealing or misrepresenting the truth.

A Misrepresentation made with the express intention of defrauding someone, which subsequently causes injury to that person.
In order for a statement to be deceit, it must be untrue, made with knowledge of its falsity, or made in reckless disregard of the truth. The misrepresentation must be such that it causes harm to another individual.
 
Negligent Misrepresentation
In order to recover for negligent misrepresentation, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant breached his duty to exercise due care in acquiring and transmitting information, and made a false statement of material fact, with an intent to induce the plaintiff’s reliance, and that the plaintiff justifiably relied, causing the plaintiff damage.
 
Negligent misrepresentation is one of the three recognized varieties of misrepresentations in contract law (along with innocent and fraudulent misrepresentation). Basically, it means that you did not directly lie (say something you KNOW to be false), but you made a representation about something while having no reasonable reasons for believing it to be true, such as when Sygenta claimed that its GMO corn could be sold in all major markets for American-grown corn.

Example: A real estate broker tries to sell a house to a buyer, who stresses his need for peace and quiet. The broker promises that the house is very quiet. In reality, the house next door is undergoing a very noisy reconstruction. Although the broker did not know this, her promise that the house was quiet was made without her having any reason to believe that that was the case. She simply assumed it. This would be a negligent misrepresentation (had she known about the construction and lied about it, however, that would be a much more serious fraudulent misrepresentation). 

What Constitutes Negligent Misrepresentation? 
The essential elements of a claim of negligent misrepresentation are: 

Someone made a false representation as to a past or existing fact. Statements about the future do not count, nor do opinions or typical "car-salesman" type phrases ("This is a great car," "This is a real deal," and the like).
The person making the belief must have no reasonable ground for believing it to be true. So in the real estate broker example, if the broker had lived in the house for 10 years, and always found it to be quiet in the past, then her misrepresentation would not have been negligent (in that case it would have been an innocent misrepresentation).
The representation must have been made with the intent to induce the other party to rely upon it. Basically, you had to be using your misrepresentation in order to help you make the deal.
The other party must have believed the misrepresentation and reasonably relied on it. Most courts are hesitant to protect a buyer if he is unreasonable in relying on whatever the seller told him (for example, in trying to sell him a car, the seller assured him it could go "a million miles an hour," and the buyer believes this). The buyer must also rely partly (or in many courts, wholly), on the misrepresentation in deciding to go ahead with the transaction.
As a result of the reliance on the misrepresentation, the other party suffered damages. This means the buyer must be actually harmed by the final transaction, otherwise there is no liability.

Inducement and innuendo
Innuendo is the connection between the inducement and the defamation which explains why the statement is defamatory.
 
Colloquium
Colloquium is the offer of extrinsic evidence to explain the defamatory sense of the defendant’s statement, and is included in a complaint when a statement is not defamatory on its face.

Special Damages
As the term is used in the law of defamation, special damages are those of a pecuniary nature, such as loss of a job or loss of customers or business.
 
Retraction Requirement
 
Absolute Privileges
Under an absolute privilege the defendant has complete immunity from liability for defamation, even if he defames maliciously, knowing the statements to be untrue.
 
Qualified Privileges
Under a qualified privilege, the defendant has immunity from liability for defamation if he is acting for the following socially desirable purposes:
1) to protect the defendant’s own interests
2) to protect the interest of others
3) to protect a common interest
4) to protect a public interest
5) to offer an opinion within the Fair Comment Privilege
 
Fair Comment Privilege
The Fair Comment Privilege is a common law rule derived from the First Amendment rights of free speech and free press.
