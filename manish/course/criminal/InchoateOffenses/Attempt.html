      <td><p class="bodytext">Under the common law it is a crime to attempt to 

          commit any misdemeanor or felony. The basic components of attempt are:</p>

        <p class="bodytext">1) a specific intent to commit a crime and<br>

          2) an act that takes a step toward completing the crime. </p>

        <p class="bodytext">The intent or mens rea aspect of attempt has two elements 

          to it. The first is that the defendant must have intent to commit an 

          act that is necessary for the commission of a crime or an act that will 

          result in the commission of the crime. The second is that the defendant 

          must have the intent for the result of the crime itself. Keep in mind 

          that this second element is missing from all crimes but specific intent 

          crimes. To commit a crime of intent, a defendant must actually desire 

          the criminal result to come about. See People 

          v. Matthews, 258 N.E.2d 378 (Ill. 1970). For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"><span class="bodytextColor">Yogi is a homeless 

          man who lives on the streets of Jellystone. During one particularly 

          cold winter night Yogi decides to break into the basement of Mr. Ranger&#8217;s 

          house and spend the night there. Yogi approaches Mr. Ranger&#8217;s 

          house and begins to pry open a basement window but is arrested as he 

          is doing so. In this case, Yogi cannot be convicted of attempted burglary. 

          Attempted burglary requires both the intent to commit the acts that 

          make up the burglary (which are the breaking and entering of the dwelling 

          of another at night) and the intent necessary for the actual burglary 

          which is the intent to commit a crime once inside the dwelling. Here, 

          Yogi does satisfy the first element of the <i>mens rea</i> test because 

          he did intend to break and enter Mr. Ranger&#8217;s house at night. 

          However, he did not meet the second element because he never intended 

          to commit a crime once inside the house. In other words, Yogi intended 

          to commit the acts constituting a burglary but he never intended to 

          commit the actual burglary. Therefore, Yogi cannot be convicted of attempted 

          burglary.</span></p>

        <p class="bodytext">Most jurisdictions hold that there is no such thing 

          as attempt to commit crimes that require a mens rea less than intent 

          (ex. crimes committed through recklessness) for the simple reason that, 

          by definition, you cannot attempt to be reckless. See State 

          v. Dunbar, 817 P.2d 1360 (Wash. 1991). For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">Luckless, upset over the fact that he has just 

          been laid off, closes his eyes and throws a knife onto a crowded sidewalk. 

          Luckily, the knife misses all the people on the sidewalk and lands harmlessly 

          on the pavement. Had the knife injured or killed someone, Luckless could 

          have been charged with homicide or assault because his action was clearly 

          reckless. However, he can not be charged with attempted homicide or 

          attempted assault because he did not specifically intend to hurt or 

          kill anyone.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">Even if the victim does sustain an injury through 

          the defendant's reckless actions, there cannot be an attempted murder 

          charge unless the defendant intended for the victim's death to result. 

          For Example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">After helping the Boston Red Sox win their first 

          World Series championship in eighty five years Ramon Garcia climbs to 

          the top of the green monster in left field and in a fit of celebration 

          begins to fling baseball bats down onto the crowd below. One of the 

          bats hits a fan on the head fracturing his skull and severely injuring 

          him. The fan is rushed to the hospital and remains in a near death state 

          for the next two weeks. However, the fan eventually recovers. Had the 

          fan died, Garcia could have been convicted of homicide because he acted 

          with the awareness that his actions bore a high risk of death or serious 

          injury to one of the fans below, which is enough to prove intent for 

          homicide purposes. However, this mens rea is not enough for attempted 

          murder. Attempted murder always requires the intent to kill. Here, Garcia 

          did not have the intent to kill. He merely acted recklessly and there 

          is no such thing as attempted recklessness. </p>

        <p class="bodytext">As far as the actus reus element of attempt is concerned, 

          what is required is the commission of an act that represents a step 

          toward the committing of the crime. However, this step must be something 

          beyond simple &quot;preparation.&quot; See State 

          v. Bereman, 276 P.2d 364 (Kan. 1954).</p>

        <p class="bodytext">Although case law has established a number of different 

          definitions as to what constitutes an act that progresses toward the 

          commission of the crime, the most straightforward definition comes from 

          the Model Penal Code which requires that 1) the act be a substantial 

          step in the events that are supposed to result in the commission of 

          the crime; and 2) that the act be strong evidence of the defendant&#8217;s 

          criminal purpose. See United 

          States v. Jackson, 560 F.2d 112 (2nd Cir. 1977). </p>

        <p class="bodytext">The Model Penal Code goes on to list a number of acts 

          that qualify as a &quot;substantial step.&quot; They are 1) lying in 

          wait for a victim; 2) luring a victim to the place where the crime will 

          be committed; 3) staking out a place where the crime will be committed; 

          4) unlawfully entering the place where the crime will be committed; 

          5) the gathering of material that is necessary to commit the crime either 

          at or near the place where the crime is going to be committed; and 6) 

          soliciting another person to assist in the criminal activity. Please 

          note, however, that if a defendant stakes out a number of different 

          potential victims and never settles on a victim for the intended crime, 

          he cannot be convicted of attempt because the staking out does not constitute 

          the necessary act. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"> Mitch has decided to rob one of the banks in 

          Grand Cayman. Grand Cayman has six banks and Mitch drives around, staking 

          out each one of the six banks. However, he decides, after looking around, 

          that it would be too hard to rob any of the banks and abandons his plan. 

          In this case, Mitch cannot be convicted of attempted robbery because 

          the fact that he never identified a specific target of his crime means 

          that his actions have not gone far enough to constitute attempt. See 

          People v. Smith, 593 N.E.2d 533 

          (Ill. 1992).</p>

        <p class="bodytext">There are several possible defenses that can be employed 

          if a defendant is charged with an attempt to commit a crime. The first 

          is impossibility. In a situation where the defendant believes he can 

          commit a crime but, for reasons that are not known to him, it is impossible 

          to actually commit the crime, actions that would ordinarily be enough 

          for a conviction may, in some circumstances, not constitute attempt 

          because of the impossibility of actually committing the crime. </p>

        <p class="bodytext">The general rule is that if the impossibility is a 

          &quot;legal&quot; impossibility, the defendant can mount an impossibility 

          defense. However, if the impossibility is only a &quot;factual&quot; 

          impossibility he cannot mount the defense. See People 

          v. Dlugash 41 N.Y.2d 725 (1977).</p>

        <p class="bodytext">Legal impossibility is basically where the defendant 

          sets out to commit an act that he thinks is criminal. However, his actions 

          are not, in fact, illegal. In this case the defendant&#8217;s misunderstanding 

          concerns the law itself. In other words he mistakenly believes that 

          the law criminalizes his actions when in fact it does not. In such a 

          case the defendant will be able to mount an impossibility defense. For 

          example: </p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"> The city of Kingston has passed a law allowing 

          the free use of marijuana. The law is to go into effect on April 1st 

          and, as of April 1st, the use and sale of marijuana will be legal. Bob 

          is under the mistaken impression that marijuana will only be legalized 

          on May 1st. Nevertheless on April 15th, believing that his actions are 

          criminal, Bob sells marijuana to Peter. In this case, Bob is not guilty 

          of attempt to sell marijuana because he can mount an impossibility defense. 

          The reason for this is that it is legally impossible to commit the crime 

          he was trying to commit. In this case, Bob&#8217;s mistake was in regard 

          to the law itself. Bob set out to commit a criminal act by selling marijuana 

          but, because of his misunderstanding the law, his actions were in fact 

          legal. Since it was clearly legally impossible for Bob to commit the 

          crime he attempted to commit, he has a viable impossibility defense 

          in this case.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">Factual impossibility is where the defendant sets 

          out to commit an act that, if successful, would constitute a crime but, 

          because of certain factors that the defendant does not know about, it 

          is impossible for him to actually commit the crime. In this situation 

          the defendant&#8217;s mistake is not in regard to the actual law but, 

          rather, in regard to the factual circumstances surrounding his actions. 

          This is considered factual impossibility, and factual impossibility 

          is not a defense to a charge of attempt. See People 

          v. Fiegelman, 33 Cal. App. 2d 100 (1939). For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"> Knowing it is a crime to sell marijuana, Bob 

          goes out and sells Peter what looks to be a dime bag of pot. Bob is 

          not a particularly bright drug dealer and he accidentally sells Peter 

          a bag of oregano. In this case, it is impossible for Bob to actually 

          violate the crime of selling marijuana because the substance he has 

          sold is not marijuana. However, Bob&#8217;s mistake is not one regarding 

          the law. Bob knows that it is illegal to sell marijuana and it is, in 

          fact, illegal. Rather, his mistake involves the circumstances surrounding 

          his actions. That being the case, even though it is impossible for Bob 

          to violate the law he is trying to violate, this is only a factual impossibility 

          and, since factual impossibility is not a defense to attempt, Bob can 

          be convicted of the attempt to sell marijuana.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">The second possible defense against a charge of attempt 

          is withdrawal. The traditional rule was that withdrawal from an attempt 

          was never a defense even if it was completely voluntary. See United 

          States v. Shelton, 30 F.3d 702 (6th Cir. 1994). However, the Model 

          Penal Code and the statutes that are based on it allow withdrawal to 

          be used as a defense so long as two conditions are met. First, the withdrawal 

          (the abandonment of the attempt) must be entirely voluntary. This means 

          that the withdrawal cannot be based on any circumstances regarding the 

          difficulty of actually committing the crime or the chances of being 

          caught that the defendant was unaware of when he began his attempt. 

          For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">Mitch decides to rob the First National Bank 

          of Grand Cayman. He then proceeds to case out the bank and gather special 

          drilling tools that he will use in breaking into the bank&#8217;s vault. 

          However, Mitch eventually realizes that the security at the bank is 

          better than he initially thought it would be and so he abandons his 

          plan to rob the bank. In this situation, although Mitch has withdrawn 

          from his attempt to rob the bank, he can still be convicted of the attempt 

          because his withdrawal was not completely voluntary. Rather, it was 

          based on circumstances that Mitch was unaware of initially that relate 

          to the difficulty of successfully committing the crime. Had Mitch woken 

          up on the morning of the robbery and decided not to rob the bank because 

          stealing is not the right thing to do, that would be an entirely voluntary 

          <br>

          withdrawal and would therefore offer him a legitimate defense to a charge 

          of attempted robbery.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">Second, in order for the withdrawal to be valid under 

          the Model Penal Code, the withdrawal must be complete. That is to say, 

          the defendant must completely cancel his plans to commit the crime. 

          If he only postpones his plans to commit the crime it is not considered 

          a complete withdrawal and he can still be charged with the attempt.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">As far as the penalty for attempt is concerned, at 

          common law attempt is punishable by a lesser penalty than the actual 

          completed crime. However, the Model Penal Code allows for the same penalty 

          to be handed down for both the attempt and the completed crime.</p>

        <p><span class="bodytext">Another important point regarding attempt is 

          that an attempt to commit a crime &quot;merges&quot; with the completed 

          crime. The effect of this is that an individual cannot be convicted 

          of both an attempt to commit a specific crime and the completed crime. 

          Thus a defendant who shoots and kills a victim cannot be charged with 

          both the murder of the victim and the attempted murder of the victim, 

          even though, technically, he has satisfied the elements of both the 

          murder and the attempted murder.</span></p>

        <p><span class="bodytext">Finally, it is worthwhile to note that an attempt 

          to commit a crime is a &quot;lesser included offense&quot; of the completed 

          crime. Therefore, a defendant who is put on trial for a murder cannot 

          later be put on trial for attempting that same murder. Since one offense 

          is a lesser included offense of the other, putting the defendant on 

          trial for both would violate the &quot;double jeopardy&quot; clause 

          of the Fifth Amendment, which prohibits trying a defendant twice for 

          the same offense.</span><br>
