      <td><p class="bodytext">In its most basic sense, a conspiracy is simply 

          an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime. However, 

          there are several requirements that must be met in order for a defendant 

          to have actually committed the crime of conspiracy. The first requirement 

          is the <i>mens rea</i> requirement which actually has two prongs. The 

          first prong is that the defendant must have actually intended to agree 

          to commit a crime. The second prong is that the defendant must have 

          intended to accomplish the objective of the conspiracy when he entered 

          into the agreement. In other words, in order for the <i>mens rea</i> 

          requirement to be satisfied, the defendant must intend to form an agreement 

          with others to commit a crime and, at the time the defendant made the 

          agreement, he must have intended to do what he would need to do in order 

          to bring about the objective of the conspiracy (ie. the commission of 

          the crime) as well. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"> Rubin asks Clay if he will work with Rubin to 

          rob the First National Bank of Hollywood. Clay agrees to help Rubin 

          but, in his mind, Clay plans on turning Rubin in to the police before 

          the robbery actually takes place. In this situation, Clay is not guilty 

          of conspiracy because, although he intended to agree with Rubin, he 

          did not intend to accomplish the objective of the conspiracy when he 

          made the agreement.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">Please note that, many times, the prosecution will 

          prove the requisite intent by showing that the defendant had a stake 

          in the venture he was planning with his co-conspirators. In other words, 

          the prosecution can prove intent by demonstrating that the defendant 

          was going to benefit, either financially or otherwise, if the object 

          of the conspiracy was successfully carried out. This allowance is, of 

          course necessary, as it would be almost impossible to actually show 

          what was going through the defendant's mind at any given time. Therefore, 

          circumstantial evidence is allowed, and indeed is prevalent, when trying 

          to prove the state of mind of a defendant. See Direct 

          Sales Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 703 (1943).</p>

        <p class="bodytext">There is some debate as to whether or not a defendant 

          can be convicted for conspiracy if he did not know that what he was 

          conspiring to do was illegal. Some jurisdictions do not criminalize 

          a conspiracy unless the defendant knew that the object of the conspiracy 

          was a crime. However, other jurisdictions hold that, since ignorance 

          of the law is generally not a defense to a criminal charge, conspiracy 

          is no exception and a defendant can be guilty of a conspiracy to commit 

          an act even though he did not know that the act was a crime. See People 

          v. McLaughlin, 111 Cal. App. 2d 781 (1952).</p>

        <p class="bodytext">As far as the actus reus requirement for conspiracy 

          is concerned, at common law, a conspiracy is completed as soon as an 

          agreement between one or more people is made. See Williams 

          v. United States, 218 F.2d 276 (4th Cir. 1954) However, most jurisdictions 

          today also require that there must have been at least one &quot;overt 

          act&quot; taken in furtherance of the conspiracy by at least one of 

          the conspirators for there to have been a chargeable criminal conspiracy. 

          This overt act need not take place at the time or location of the conspiracy. 

          For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">Fred and Barney agree to rob the First National 

          Bank of Bedrock. Without more than just an agreement, most jurisdictions 

          today would not hold Fred or Barney liable for conspiracy. However, 

          if Fred drives the getaway car to the bank and parks it outside the 

          bank so that Barney will have a means of escape, both Fred and Barney 

          would immediately be guilty of conspiracy. (Fred's overt act crystallizes 

          the conspiracy and thus makes Barney guilty as well.) Even if the crime 

          is planned for Wednesday night and on Monday, Fred goes out and buys 

          a gun for Barney to use during the robbery, this would be considered 

          an overt act and both parties would immediately be guilty of conspiracy.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">It is important to remember that it takes two people 

          to enter into an agreement. If one party does not intend to enter into 

          an agreement, the second party cannot be convicted of a conspiracy. 

          For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"> Darryl is a drug dealer who is about to import 

          a large shipment of heroin from south of the border. Darryl has recently 

          become friends with Doc and he asks Doc if he would like to help him 

          import and distribute the heroin. Doc agrees to help Darryl. What Darryl 

          does not know is that Doc is a federal narcotics agent who has been 

          investigating Darryl. Before Darryl is able to pick up the shipment, 

          Doc has him arrested. In this case, Darryl cannot be charged with conspiracy 

          because Doc never intended to enter into an agreement with him. Since 

          it takes two people to agree on something, and Doc never intended to 

          enter into an agreement, there was no agreement for Darryl to enter 

          into. Darryl cannot therefore be convicted for conspiracy.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">If the prosecution can prove conspiracy between two 

          parties, the actions of a third party may be used to prove the third 

          party&#8217;s involvement in the conspiracy, even if there is no direct 

          evidence that the third party actually entered into an agreement. For 

          example:</p>

        <p><span class="bodytextColor">Darryl and Doc are two drug dealers who 

          agree to work together to import a large shipment of heroin from south 

          of the border. If Darryl and Doc use Steve&#8217;s car to bring the 

          drugs across the border, Steve can be found to be a co-conspirator. 

          In this case, all the prosecution would have to do to convict Steve 

          is to prove that the car used to transport the drugs across the border 

          belonged to him, and of course, that Steve consented to the use of his 

          car for the activity. See 

          United States v. Knight, 416 F.2d 1181 (9th Cir. 1969).</span></p>

        <p class="bodytext">Additionally, the agreement that constitutes a conspiracy 

          does not have to be an express agreement. Rather, if the defendant sees 

          a criminal act going on and assists those who are committing the act, 

          this is considered an implied agreement to take part in the crime and 

          he can be convicted as a co-conspirator even though he never expressly 

          agreed with the other parties to commit the criminal act. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">Darryl and Doc are two drug dealers who agree 

          to work together to bring a shipment of heroin across the border. Darryl 

          and Doc drive to the border on the appointed night and begin unloading 

          the drugs from their supplier&#8217;s truck into their own van. Steve 

          happens to be driving by and sees what is going on. Wanting to ingratiate 

          himself with Darryl and Doc, Steve hops out of his car and begins helping 

          them to unload the drugs. In this situation, even though Steve has never 

          agreed expressly to be a part of the criminal activity, his act of helping 

          Darryl and Doc constitutes an implied agreement to be a part of the 

          criminal activity and therefore, based on this implied agreement, Steve 

          can be convicted as a co-conspirator. See Bender 

          v. State, 253 A.2d 686 (Del. 1969).</p>

        <p><span class="bodytext">Until now, our discussion has involved the basic 

          elements of the crime of conspiracy where one person has made an agreement 

          to commit a crime with another person. However, certain issues arise 

          when many people are involved in one conspiracy or many crimes are the 

          subject of one agreement. Generally, if there is only one agreement 

          between the parties then there is only one conspiracy regardless of 

          how many crimes the conspirators plan to commit. See Doolin 

          v. State, 650 So.2d 44 (Fla. 1995)</span>. 

          For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"> Darryl and Doc agree to bring a shipment of 

          heroin across the border, sell the drugs, and then launder the money 

          through a legitimate shell corporation. In this case, even though Darryl 

          and Doc have agreed to commit three different crimes, they have agreed 

          to commit those crimes under one single agreement. Therefore they can 

          only be convicted of one conspiracy.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">The two kinds of conspiracies involving multiple people 

          and multiple transactions are colloquially called the &quot;chain and 

          link&quot; conspiracy and the &quot;wheel and spoke&quot; conspiracy. 

          A chain and link conspiracy is a conspiracy in which there are a series 

          of overlapping transactions which are construed to involve only one 

          overall agreement. The different transactions are considered the links 

          in the overall agreement, which is considered the chain. However, the 

          transactions will only be considered links in a chain if each link knows 

          that the other links are involved in the conspiracy and each link has 

          a vested interest in the success of the overall series of transactions. 

          See United States v. 

          Bruno, 105 F.2d 921 (2nd Cir.) For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">Robert is a drug kingpin who routinely smuggles 

          large shipments of heroin across the border. Robert agrees to sell his 

          heroin to Downey. Downey agrees to sell the heroin to Junior, and Junior, 

          a street dealer, then sells the heroin to his customers. Robert and 

          Junior never speak to each other. However, despite the fact that Robert 

          and Junior do not have any express agreement or communication, they 

          are links in the chain of one larger conspiracy because they both know 

          that the other is involved and they each understand that their own personal 

          success in this endeavor is dependent on the success of the endeavor 

          as a whole. In other words, although Robert and Junior may not know 

          each other, Junior knows that Downey is getting his drugs from a supplier 

          and Robert knows that Downey is selling his drugs to a dealer. That 

          being the case, each is aware of each other&#8217;s participation in 

          the conspiracy. Further, each link in the chain understands that his 

          or her own personal success in this transaction is dependent on the 

          success of the transaction as a whole. In other words, Robert knows 

          that his success depends on Downey being able to buy the drugs from 

          him and then sell them to Junior. Downey understands that his success 

          depends on Robert getting his drugs, selling them to Downey and Downey 

          being able to sell them to Junior. Junior understands that his success 

          likewise depends on Robert being able to obtain the drugs and sell them 

          to Downey and Downey being able to sell them to him. All three links 

          in the chain know about each other and effectively depend on each other&#8217;s 

          success for their own. Therefore, each party is a link in an overall 

          single chain. </p>

        <p class="bodytext">A &quot;wheel and spoke&quot; conspiracy is where 

          one person or entity, the &quot;wheel&quot; (also sometimes called the 

          &quot;hub&quot; because all the activity revolves around that party), 

          has different conspiratorial agreements with different people who have 

          nothing to do with each other. In this case, the one common person is 

          the wheel and each co-conspirator is a different spoke. See 

          Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750 (1946). For example:</p>

        <p><span class="bodytextColor">Lone Star Motion Picture Association is 

          a production company that produces several major motion pictures every 

          year. In violation of federal anti-trust laws, Lone Star makes agreements 

          with thirty different movie theater companies around the country to 

          artificially inflate movie ticket prices. In this situation, Lone Star 

          is the hub of the wheel. It is the one common entity among all of the 

          agreements. However, each one of the thirty movie theater companies 

          is a spoke. They have nothing to do with each other; yet they all have 

          an agreement with the hub. Therefore, Lone Star has thirty different 

          conspiracies going on here, one with each of the movie theater companies, 

          and if the prosecution wants to convict each of the movie theater companies 

          for conspiracy, the prosecution will have to prove thirty different 

          conspiracies, one for each movie theater company. </span></p>

        <p class="bodytext">Although we will not go into this in any more detail, 

          please note that federal racketeering statutes have been passed by Congress 

          in order to link the different spokes in a wheel and spoke conspiracy. 

          In other words, based on these racketeering statutes called the RICO 

          statutes, assuming that these statutes apply, the prosecution would 

          not have to prove thirty different conspiracies for each of the movie 

          theaters involved with Lone Star. Rather, all that the prosecution would 

          have to do is to prove that Lone Star had a conspiracy with one of the 

          theater companies, and based on that agreement, he could successfully 

          charge all thirty companies. The reason that Congress passed the RICO 

          statutes was to allow federal prosecutors to more easily combat organized 

          crime. </p>

        <p class="bodytext">At common law, conspiracy is a misdemeanor. However, 

          modern statutes differ as to what punishments are warranted by a conviction 

          for conspiracy. Some jurisdictions impose penalties that are related 

          to, but less than, the penalties warranted for the target crime. However, 

          the Model Penal Code calls for the same punishment as is required for 

          the most serious crime the parties agree to commit.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">Further, at common law, if a conspiracy is followed 

          by the completion of the crime, the charge of conspiracy merged into 

          the completed crime. What this means is that the defendant can only 

          be charged for the completed crime and not for the conspiracy. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"> O.J. and Al conspire to murder Nicole. If they 

          actually do kill Nicole, the conspiracy to commit the murder will merge 

          into the completed crime. In other words, at common law, O.J. and Al 

          can only be charged with the murder itself and not with the conspiracy 

          to commit murder because the conspiracy is swallowed up, so to speak, 

          by the completed crime.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">The merger of conspiracy into the completed crime 

          has been abandoned by modern rules. Keep in mind that in this respect, 

          conspiracy differs from the other inchoate crimes of solicitation and 

          attempt. As discussed in the other sections, solicitation and attempt 

          &quot;merge&quot; with the completed crimes. Conspiracy, however, does 

          not merge with the completed crime. Therefore, defendants who conspire 

          to commit a crime and who then actually commit the crime can be convicted 

          of both the conspiracy and the completed crime.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">As we mentioned before, a conspiracy, by definition, 

          requires at least two people. Therefore, if one of the parties did not 

          actually enter into an agreement, both &quot;conspirators&quot; must 

          be acquitted because there could not have been an agreement without 

          the agreement and consent of both parties. This is known as the &quot;plurality&quot; 

          requirement for conspiracy. The typical example, as we discussed earlier, 

          is if a person conspires with an undercover police officer to commit 

          a crime. In that case, because the officer did not intend to enter into 

          an agreement with the defendant, there was no &quot;agreement&quot; 

          for the defendant to enter into and so the defendant must be acquitted. 

          Additionally, if a defendant is tried with a number of other defendants 

          for conspiracy and all of the other defendants are acquitted, then the 

          defendant must be acquitted as well because, again, by definition, he 

          could not have entered into a conspiracy unless someone else entered 

          into it with him. However, he can be convicted so long as at least one 

          other co-defendant is convicted because, as long as there is one other 

          possibly guilty co-conspirator, an agreement remains possible. See Eyman 

          v. Deutsch, 373 P. 2d 716 (Ariz. 1962).</p>

        <p class="bodytext">In other words, if a defendant is tried with twenty 

          other people for conspiracy and those twenty people are acquitted, the 

          defendant also must be acquitted. However, if nineteen of the twenty 

          are acquitted, then the defendant and the last remaining co-defendant 

          can still be convicted, because an agreement still remains possible.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">Further, the defendant can be convicted of conspiracy 

          even if his co-conspirators are never caught and tried. As long as the 

          prosecution can prove that there was an agreement between the defendant 

          and the other party, the conviction will stand. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"> O.J. and Al conspire to murder Nicole. Before 

          they can actually carry out the crime, Al is caught but O.J. escapes 

          and law enforcement cannot find him. If Al is tried for the conspiracy 

          to commit murder, he can be convicted as a co-conspirator, even if O.J. 

          is never caught and tried, as long as the prosecution can prove that 

          Al made an agreement with O.J. to commit the crime.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">There is a split of authority in situations where 

          several co-conspirators are tried for conspiracy and the charges against 

          all of the co-conspirators except for one are dismissed. Certain jurisdictions 

          consider the dismissal of charges as tantamount to acquittals and so 

          the charges against the remaining defendant must be dismissed. However, 

          other jurisdictions do not equate dismissals with acquittals and hold 

          that the one remaining defendant can be tried and convicted for conspiracy 

          anyway. See Regle v. State, 264 

          A.2d 119 (Md. 1970).</p>

        <p class="bodytext">The Model Penal Code has taken a much more stringent 

          line on conspiracy by adopting a &quot;unilateral&quot; approach to 

          conspiracy. According to the Model Penal Code&#8217;s unilateral approach, 

          a conviction for conspiracy does not require an agreement between at 

          least two people. Rather, a defendant can be convicted of conspiring 

          to commit a crime as long as he himself agreed to take part in the crime. 

          In other words, at common law, if a defendant agrees to commit a crime 

          with an undercover police officer or with a co-conspirator who is eventually 

          acquitted or with a co-conspirator against whom the charges are eventually 

          dismissed, the defendant could not be convicted because, in each of 

          these cases, there was no plurality in the agreement. Essentially, the 

          defendant had agreed with nobody and so he himself could not be convicted 

          of making an agreement. According to the Model Penal Code, however, 

          the defendant can be convicted in each of these cases because it is 

          not necessary to have another guilty person to agree with. As long as 

          the defendant himself agreed to commit a crime, he can be convicted. 

        </p>

        <p class="bodytext">As far as defenses to conspiracies are concerned, 

          the fact that it was impossible to successfully complete the target 

          crime is not a defense. In other words, if the defendant is tried for 

          conspiracy to commit a crime, he cannot avoid a conviction simply because 

          it was impossible to commit the crime he was trying to commit. </p>

        <p class="bodytext">There is a split in authority as to whether or not 

          withdrawal is a viable defense. The general rule is that a defendant&#8217;s 

          withdrawal from a conspiracy is not a defense. Therefore he can be convicted 

          of the conspiracy even if he has withdrawn from it. See United 

          States v. Read, 658 F.2d 1225 (7th Cir. 1981). However, the Model 

          Penal Code allows a defendant to avoid a conviction if he can prove 

          that he completely and voluntarily withdrew from the conspiracy and 

          prevented the success of the conspiracy from being achieved. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"> O.J. and Al conspire to kill Nicole. On the 

          morning that the murder is supposed to take place, O.J. changes his 

          mind and tells Al that he no longer thinks that killing Nicole is the 

          right thing to do. According to the general rule, O.J. can be convicted 

          of the conspiracy even though he has withdrawn. However, according to 

          the model penal code, O.J. can avoid a conviction if he completely and 

          voluntarily withdraws from the conspiracy and he successfully prevents 

          the murder from taking place. Note that if he tries but fails to prevent 

          the murder, even under the Model Penal Code, he would still be guilty 

          of conspiracy.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">Because co-conspirators have all agreed to participate 

          in the commission of a crime, each co-conspirator is liable for any 

          other crime committed by any other co-conspirator if the crime was committed 

          in furtherance of the conspiracy and the crime was a reasonably foreseeable 

          result of the conspiracy. See Pinkerton 

          v. United States, 328 U.S. 640 (1946). For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"> Fred is a security guard who works at the First 

          National Bank of Bedrock. Fred suggests to his friend Barney that the 

          bank has some cracks in its security and might be a good target for 

          a robbery. Fred and Barney then conspire to rob the bank. The plan calls 

          for Barney to enter the bank through the front door, hold up one of 

          the bank tellers and then quietly slip out the back door that Fred would 

          open for him. Upon leaving the bank, Fred&#8217;s car is to be waiting 

          for Barney and Barney will take the car and drive to a hideout. Unfortunately, 

          things do not go according to the plan. As Barney is entering the bank, 

          he is confronted by a different security guard. Rather than turn around 

          and leave the bank, Barney kills the guard and proceeds with the robbery. 

          He then proceeds to rape one of the bank&#8217;s customers at gunpoint 

          while the teller is placing money into the duffle bag that Barney has 

          given her to fill up. Finally, after Barney runs out of the bank, Fred's 

          car will not start and so he steals a car and drives to his hideout. 

          In this situation, because Fred has conspired with Barney to rob the 

          bank, he can be convicted of any crime Barney committed that was in 

          furtherance of the conspiracy and was a foreseeable result of the conspiracy. 

          Looking at the 3 &quot;additional&quot; crimes committed by Barney, 

          Fred can be convicted for the murder of the security guard and the car 

          theft because those were in furtherance of the conspiracy and were foreseeable. 

          However, Fred will most likely not be convicted for the rape because 

          it was neither in furtherance of the conspiracy, nor was it a foreseeable 

          result of the conspiracy to rob the bank.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">As we said before, at common law, withdrawal is not 

          a defense to a charge of conspiracy. However, if the defendant does 

          effectively withdraw, though he is still guilty of the crime of conspiracy, 

          he cannot be convicted for the other crimes committed by the co-conspirators 

          in furtherance of the conspiracy. See Loser 

          v. Superior Court, 78 Cal. App. 2d 30 (1947). In the above example, 

          if Fred successfully withdraws before Barney robs the bank, Fred will 

          still be guilty of conspiracy, but will not be liable for Barney's murder, 

          rape and car theft. Having said that, there are certain requirements 

          that must be met in order for the withdrawal to be legally effective 

          and thus to protect the defendant from liability for other crimes committed 

          by his co-conspirators. First, the defendant must communicate his withdrawal 

          to all the other co-conspirators. Second, the withdrawal must be timely. 

          That is to say, the withdrawal must occur in time for the other co-conspirators 

          to withdraw as well. If the defendant&#8217;s withdrawal happens so 

          close to the commission of the crime that the other co-conspirators 

          do not have the opportunity to withdraw as well, the withdrawal will 

          not be considered timely. Third, although most jurisdictions do not 

          require this, a few jurisdictions require the defendant to successfully 

          stop the commission of the target crime in order for his withdrawal 

          to be complete. </p>

        <p class="bodytext">Finally, since a defendant can be convicted for all 

          crimes committed by his co-conspirators that are committed in furtherance 

          of the conspiracy, it is important to determine when a conspiracy actually 

          ends. The general rule is that a conspiracy is over once all the objectives 

          of the agreement have been successfully accomplished. See People 

          v. Lewis, 222 Cal. App. 2d 136 (1963). For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytextColor"> Fred and Barney enter 

          into an agreement to rob the First National Bank of Bedrock, launder 

          the money through some legitimate shell corporations and then split 

          the proceeds of the robbery equally. In this case, Fred and Barney&#8217;s 

          conspiracy has three different objectives. The first is to rob the bank, 

          the second is to launder the money, and the third is to split the proceeds 

          evenly. Therefore, the conspiracy will not be concluded until the money 

          is split equally and, until the money is split evenly, Fred and Barney 

          can be convicted of any crime that the other one commits in furtherance 

          of any of the three goals of the conspiracy. Once the conspiracy is 

          over, neither Fred nor Barney can be convicted of anything the other 

          person does afterwards. So, for example, if, after the money is split, 

          Fred takes his share and buys a large quantity of heroin with it that 

          he then turns around and sells it to addicts on the street, Barney cannot 

          be convicted as co-conspirator because these crimes have been committed 

          after the conspiracy has already concluded. </span></p>
