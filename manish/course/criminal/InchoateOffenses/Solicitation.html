      <td><p class="bodytext">The crime of solicitation is committed when the 

          defendant advises, encourages, induces or requests another person to 

          either commit a crime or join the defendant in committing a crime. Under 

          the common law, solicitation is a misdemeanor regardless of whether 

          the crime the defendant has encouraged or requested is a misdemeanor 

          or a felony.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">As far as the required mens rea is concerned, the 

          defendant can be convicted of solicitation if the prosecution can show 

          that he acted volitionally and with the intent to cause the solicited 

          individual to commit the crime. As far as the actus reus is concerned, 

          the only act required for the crime of solicitation is the advising, 

          encouraging, inducing or requesting of another person to commit the 

          crime. In other words, as soon as the defendant asks another person 

          to commit a crime or encourages him to do so, he has committed the act 

          of solicitation. Solicitation does not require that the person solicited 

          actually commit the crime. In fact, the defendant can be convicted of 

          solicitation even if the person solicited completely ignores the request. 

          See State v. Schleifer, 

          121 A. 805 (Conn. 1923) For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"> Rubin stops Clay on the street and asks Clay 

          if he would like to help him rob a bank. Clay keeps walking and doesn&#8217;t 

          even bother to answer Rubin&#8217;s question. In this case, even though 

          Clay has not so much as acknowledged Rubin, Rubin can be convicted of 

          solicitation because the solicitation was committed simply by the request 

          that Clay help him with the robbery.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">The Model Penal Code defines solicitation as the common 

          law does. However, unlike the common law, which called for a lower penalty 

          for solicitation than would be imposed for the solicited crime itself, 

          the Model Penal Code makes solicitation punishable to the same extent 

          as is allowed for the solicited crime. </p>

        <p class="bodytext">In the event that a defendant solicits another person 

          to commit a crime and the person he solicits actually commits the crime, 

          the defendant becomes an accessory before the fact and the defendant 

          can therefore be convicted for both the solicitation and for his role 

          as an accessory.</p>

        <p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext">Another important point regarding 

          solicitation is that a solicitation of a person to commit a crime &quot;merges&quot; 

          with the completed crime. A person cannot be convicted of both solicitation 

          to commit a specific crime and the completed crime.</span></p>

        <p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext">As with attempt, solicitation 

          to commit a crime is a &quot;lesser included offense&quot; of the completed 

          crime. Therefore, a defendant who is put on trial for a murder cannot 

          later be put on trial for soliciting someone else to commit that same 

          murder. Since one offense is a lesser included offense of the other, 

          putting the defendant on trial for both would violate the &quot;double 

          jeopardy&quot; clause of the Fifth Amendment, which prohibits trying 

          a defendant twice for the same offense.</span></p>
