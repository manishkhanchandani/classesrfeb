      <td><p class="bodytext">In order to be convicted of a crime, a defendant 

          must have committed an &quot;actus reus,&quot; or criminal act. Under 

          some circumstances, a defendant can be convicted of committing a crime 

          for failing to act as well (an &quot;omission&quot;). Either way, the 

          basic principles of criminal law always define crimes in terms of acts. 

          The reason for this is that we do not punish people simply for their 

          thoughts or intentions. Further, by virtue of the Eighth Amendment Ban 

          on Cruel and Unusual Punishment we do not define crimes in terms of 

          status either. For example:</p>

        <span class="bodytextColor">The State Legislature has recently passed 

        a law making it a crime to be an alcoholic. This statute is unconstitutional 

        because it criminalizes a status rather than an act or omission. If, however, 

        the Legislature had passed a law making it a crime to appear in public 

        while drunk, this would be fine. This law would be criminalizing a particular 

        act, not a mere status. See Robinson 

        v. California, 370 U.S. 660 (1962). </span> 

        <p class="bodytext">Different 

          crimes are defined by different acts. Certain crimes are defined in 

          terms of specific acts that the defendant must have committed. In such 

          a case, in order to convict a defendant of committing one of these crimes, 

          the prosecutor must prove that the defendant committed each specific 

          act. For example, as we will see later, the crime of burglary is defined 

          as &quot;the breaking and entering into someone else&#8217;s dwelling 

          at night with the intent of committing a felony.&quot; Therefore, if 

          a defendant is on trial for burglary, the prosecution will have to prove 

          that the defendant broke into another person&#8217;s dwelling, that 

          he entered the dwelling,that he did so at night and that he intended 

          to commit a felony therein. If the prosecution fails to prove even one 

          of these elements, the defendant will be acquitted.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">However, other crimes are defined by more general 

          acts. In these situations, a conviction can be based on proof that the 

          defendant committed the general act constituting the crime. For example, 

          homicide is defined as the killing of another human being. As you can 

          see, homicide is not defined in terms of any particular act of killing. 

          That being the case, the prosecution does not have to prove that the 

          defendant killed the victim with any particular act (ex. shooting or 

          stabbing, etc.). Rather, a defendant charged with homicide will be convicted 

          if the prosecution proves that the defendant committed, with the requisite 

          intent, a volitional act that resulted in the victim&#8217;s death.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">In either case, all acts must meet certain requirements. 

          For example, where criminal liability is based on an affirmative act, 

          which is usually the case, the prosecution must show that the defendant 

          made a conscious and volitional movement. See State 

          v. Mercer, 165 S.E.2d 328 (N.C. 1969). Acts that are done by a person 

          due to mere reflexes, convulsions or movements made while the defendant 

          is sleeping or otherwise unconscious do not meet the legal definition 

          of an act because they are not volitional. For example: </p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">Fred is a sleepwalker. One night during a particularly 

          vivid dream in which Fred is being chased by his friend Barney, Fred 

          takes the gun that he keeps on his bedside table, goes to Barney&#8217;s 

          house and shoots Barney. Fred wakes up in the police station, having 

          no idea why he is there or how he got there. In this instance, Fred&#8217;s 

          act will not support a conviction because he was unconscious at the 

          time he was acting. Therefore, his acts do not satisfy the actus reus 

          element that is inherent in all crimes.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">However, if the defendant was at fault for bringing 

          about his state of unconsciousness, he will be responsible for the acts 

          he commits while unconscious. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"> One night Jack Daniels and his friend Jim Beam 

          decide to go out and have a few drinks. Jack has a few too many, and 

          drinks himself into a state of oblivion. While in this state of unconsciousness, 

          Jack hits Jim over the head with a bar stool crushing Jim&#8217;s skull 

          and killing him instantly. In this case, although Jack&#8217;s actions 

          were committed while he was in a state of unconsciousness, his acts 

          will nevertheless support a conviction for homicide because he was at 

          fault for drinking to the point of unconsciousness. Of course, the severity 

          of his homicide conviction and sentence will not be as great as it would 

          be if the act were a premeditated murder, but there is enough to sustain 

          a homicide conviction. See Watkins 

          v. People, 408 P.2d 425 (Colo. 1965).</p>

        <p class="bodytext">In addition, a person can be found criminally liable 

          if he engages in a course of action knowing that he may unintentionally 

          become unconscious and hurt somebody while he is engaging in that course 

          of action. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">Rip has recently been diagnosed with narcolepsy, 

          a rare disorder in which a person instantly and suddenly falls asleep. 

          Despite knowing that he could fall asleep at any time, Rip decides to 

          take his new sports car out for a spin. While driving along a crowded 

          street, Rip falls asleep. His car veers off the road and plows into 

          a crowd of people. As a result, three people are killed. In this case, 

          Rip can be convicted for the deaths of those three people because, although 

          he was unconscious at the time he ran those people over, Rip knew that 

          he could become unconscious and potentially hurt people when he started 

          to drive the car in the first place. See 

          People v. Decina 2 N.Y.2d 133 (1956).</p>

        <p class="bodytext">As we mentioned before, under certain circumstances, 

          criminal liability can be based on a defendant&#8217;s failure to act. 

          However, in order to sustain a conviction based on a mere failure to 

          act, the prosecution must prove that 1) the defendant was under a legal 

          duty to act; 2) the defendant knew that he needed to act; and 3) it 

          was possible for the defendant to act. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">1) Hooper is sitting in his rowboat out in the 

          middle of a lake. Martin is swimming in the lake and begins to drown. 

          Martin is about fifty feet from Hooper&#8217;s boat and Hooper neither 

          sees nor hears Martin, and Martin drowns. In this case, even assuming 

          that Hooper had a legal duty to try and save Martin, the prosecution 

          could not convict him based on his failure to act because Hooper did 

          not know that he needed to act. Since Hooper had no idea that Martin 

          was in distress his lack of action will not bring a criminal conviction.</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">2) Hooper is sitting in his rowboat in the middle 

          of the lake. Martin is swimming in the lake and begins to drown. Martin 

          is about fifty feet from Hooper&#8217;s boat, but Hooper cannot make 

          his way over to Martin because his oars have fallen into the water and 

          floated away. Hooper is also a very poor swimmer. Martin drowns. Again, 

          even assuming that Hooper had the legal duty to act in this situation, 

          the prosecution will not be able to convict him for Martin&#8217;s death 

          because although Hooper knew he needed to act, it was impossible for 

          him to do so. That being the case, Hooper&#8217;s inaction will not 

          bring criminal liability.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">At common law the general rule in both civil and criminal 

          law is that there is no duty to act in order to protect or rescue another 

          person. However, as far as criminal law is concerned, there are five 

          instances under which a failure to act may result in criminal prosecution. 

          First, if the defendant has a special relationship to the victim, he 

          may have a duty to act in certain situations. The special relationships 

          that establish the duty to act are parent/child relationships, husband/wife 

          relationships and employer/employee relationships. Second, there are 

          statutory duties to act. In other words, certain states have passed 

          statutes requiring a person to act and failure to do so will result 

          in criminal prosecution. Third, a private contract between two parties 

          can generate a duty to act. This is usually the case in situations where 

          the defendant was under a contractual duty to protect or care for someone 

          else. See Commonwealth 

          vs. Pestinikas, 617 A.2d 1339 (Pa. 1992). For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">Whitney is a famous pop singer who hires Kevin 

          to be her bodyguard. Kevin is contractually bound to escort Whitney 

          while she is in public and to come to her aid if the need ever arises. 

          One day while walking in public, Whitney is mobbed by a group of fans. 

          Kevin doesn&#8217;t feel like interfering so he lets the fans crowd 

          around Whitney. One of the fans punches Whitney and steals the diamond 

          necklace she is wearing. In this situation Kevin may be criminally prosecuted 

          because he was contractually bound to come to Whitney&#8217;s aid, and 

          he failed to do so. </p>

        <p class="bodytext">The fourth instance where the failure to act can result 

          in criminal prosecution is where the defendant had no legal obligation 

          to aid the victim but he voluntarily undertook to aid the victim. In 

          this situation, if the defendant abandons his rescue efforts and thereby 

          leaves the victim in a condition that was worse than he would have been 

          in had the defendant not started to help at all, the defendant can be 

          criminally liable. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">Whitney is swimming in a lake when she begins 

          to drown. Kevin sees her drowning and jumps into a boat and begins to 

          row out to her. There are several people on shore who would have gone 

          out to help Whitney. However, when they see Kevin going to help they 

          stay on shore. For some reason, Kevin changes his mind about helping 

          Whitney and turns around and rows back to shore. Whitney drowns. In 

          this situation Kevin can be criminally liable for Whitney&#8217;s death. 

          Although he did not have the legal obligation to go to her aid, he voluntarily 

          undertook to help her and his failure to follow through with his rescue 

          effort left Whitney in a worse position than she would have been in 

          had Kevin not done anything in the first place.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">Finally, a defendant will have the duty to aid another 

          person if he wrongfully placed the victim in harm&#8217;s way to begin 

          with. In this situation, failure to help the victim can result in criminal 

          liability. </p>

        <p class="bodytext">For better or for worse, the law still does not impose 

          criminal liability for an omission to act where the defendant had nothing 

          more than a moral duty to act. See People 

          v. Beardsley 113 N.W. 1128 (Mich. 1907). For example: </p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"> Lyle and Eric decide to spend a few days gambling 

          in Las Vegas. At one point during their first night at the casino, Lyle 

          excuses himself to use the men&#8217;s room. On his way to the men&#8217;s 

          room he lures a little girl into going with him. Once they are in the 

          men&#8217;s room, Lyle attacks the little girl and starts strangling 

          her. Eric walks into the men&#8217;s room and sees his friend strangling 

          the little girl, but does nothing to stop it. Lyle ends up killing the 

          little girl. In this situation, Eric cannot be criminally prosecuted 

          for failing to help the little girl. Although Eric is a moral monster 

          for what he did, he was under no legal duty to come to the little girl&#8217;s 

          aid, and he therefore cannot be prosecuted.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">As we mentioned previously, a defendant who has the 

          legal duty to act and fails to do so will not be prosecuted if he did 

          not know that his action was needed. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">Hooper is sitting in his rowboat out in the middle 

          of a lake. Martin is swimming in the lake and begins to drown. Martin 

          is about fifty feet from Hooper&#8217;s boat and Hooper neither sees 

          nor hears Martin, and Martin drowns. </p>

        <p class="bodytext">As we said before, even assuming that Hooper had a 

          legal duty to try and save Martin, Hooper cannot be held criminally 

          liable based on this failure to act because Hooper did not know that 

          he needed to act. However, what would happen in a situation where Hooper 

          knew that Martin was in trouble but did not go to Martin&#8217;s aid 

          because he did not know that the law required him to do so?</p>

        <p class="bodytext">Usually, the defendant can still be prosecuted for 

          failing to act even if he did not know that the law required him to 

          act. This follows the general principle that &quot;ignorance of the 

          law is no excuse.&quot; Nevertheless, if the law requiring a person 

          to act says that only the &#8220;willful&#8221; failure to act is a 

          crime, then the defendant&#8217;s ignorance of the law will protect 

          him from prosecution. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">The town of Amity has passed a law saying that 

          &#8220;any person who willfully fails to go to the aid of someone who 

          is drowning will face criminal prosecution&#8221;. Hooper is sitting 

          in a boat in the middle of the lake. Martin is swimming in the lake 

          when he begins to drown. Hooper sees Martin drowning but does nothing 

          to help him. Hooper is unaware that there is a law requiring him to 

          go to Martin&#8217;s aid. In this situation, all three requirements 

          for criminalizing a failure to act are present. Hooper has a statutory 

          duty to come to Martin&#8217;s aid. He is aware that Martin needs his 

          help, and it is possible for him to help. Nevertheless, in this situation, 

          Hooper will probably escape prosecution because the law prohibits the 

          willful failure to act, and the court may hold that the willful failure 

          to act can only come about if the defendant knew the law. Here, Hooper 

          did not know the law, and so he did not willfully break the law. On 

          the other hand, had the statute simply criminalized the failure to act 

          when someone was drowning without using the word &quot;willfully,&quot; 

          then Hooper would be in violation of the law and could be criminally 

          prosecuted for it even though he did not know what the law was.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">Finally, as we mentioned before, a defendant who has 

          a legal duty to act and who is aware that his action is required will 

          nevertheless be insulated from prosecution if it was not possible for 

          him to act. In other words, the defendant will not face criminal prosecution 

          in a situation where his failure to act was due to the fact that he 

          lacked either the means or the ability to perform. </p>

        <p class="bodytext">However, please note that even if a defendant is incapable 

          of acting on his own, he can be prosecuted if it was reasonably possible 

          for him to get other people to help the victim but failed to do so. 

          See Stehr vs. State 139 N.W. 676 

          (Neb. 1913). For example:</p>

        <p> <span class="bodytextColor">Hooper is a paraplegic. One day he rolls 

          his wheelchair out onto the dock so that he can enjoy the breeze coming 

          in off the lake. While sitting on the dock, he sees Martin swimming 

          out to the middle of the lake. Martin begins to drown. Obviously it 

          is impossible for Hooper to come to Martin&#8217;s aid, but Hooper could 

          have gone to find other people to help Martin. However, Hooper just 

          sits there and watches Martin drown. In this situation, since Hooper 

          could have gone and gotten other people, and failed to do so, he can 

          be criminally prosecuted for Martin&#8217;s death. (assuming that, for 

          whatever reason, he had a duty to act.)</span></p>
