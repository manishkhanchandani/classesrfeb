      <td><p class="bodytext">Where a crime requires proof of a result (as opposed 

          to an act), in order for the defendant to be convicted, the prosecution 

          must prove that the defendant&#8217;s act was the legal cause of the 

          result. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"> Infuriated that Betty has married her ex-husband, 

          Wilma takes a baseball bat and hides behind some bushes in front of 

          Betty&#8217;s house. When Betty emerges, Wilma attacks Betty and kills 

          her with the baseball bat. Although, in this case it will be relatively 

          simple to do, the prosecution must prove that Wilma&#8217;s act resulted 

          in Betty&#8217;s death in order to obtain a conviction.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">In order to obtain a conviction, the prosecutor must 

          prove both factual and proximate causation. In order to prove factual 

          causation, the prosecutor must show that &#8220;but for&#8221; the defendant&#8217;s 

          act, the result would not have happened as it did or when it did. Please 

          note that the prosecution does not have to prove that the defendant&#8217;s 

          action was the only thing that brought about the result. The defendant&#8217;s 

          action may be one of several different actions and circumstances that 

          contributed to the result. However, as long as the prosecutor can show 

          that but for the defendant&#8217;s action, the result would not have 

          come about as it did or when it did, the prosecutor has successfully 

          proven factual causation, regardless of how many other actions and circumstances 

          were involved in accomplishing the result. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">After coming out of her house one morning, Betty 

          is attacked and beaten almost to death by Wilma. Jack Kavorkian is a 

          well-respected physician who happens to be walking by and sees Betty 

          lying in the street. Dr. Kavorkian examines Betty and knows for a medical 

          certainty that Betty will die within the next few hours regardless of 

          the medical attention she receives. Betty is in tremendous pain and 

          Dr. Kavorkian decides to put her out of her misery. He pulls out his 

          medical kit and injects Betty with some poison that he carries around 

          in case of an emergency. In this case, although Betty would have died 

          anyway, Dr. Kavorkian&#8217;s actions are the factual cause of Betty&#8217;s 

          death. But for his actions, Betty&#8217;s death would not have come 

          about when it did. Therefore, even though Dr. Kavorkian only sped up 

          the inevitable, he can be convicted for Betty&#8217;s murder. See People 

          v. Ah Fat, 48 Cal. 61 (1874).</p>

        <p class="bodytext">There are two exceptions to this &#8220;but for&#8221; 

          rule. The first exception is where the result is brought about by two 

          different factors operating concurrently, and either factor operating 

          alone would have been enough to cause the result. In such a situation, 

          each defendant&#8217;s action will be considered the factual cause of 

          the result despite the fact that, if either defendant had not done what 

          he did, the result would have been the same anyway. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"> After emerging from her house one morning, Betty 

          is attacked by Wilma and Barney. Wilma and Barney are both armed with 

          baseball bats, and they proceed to beat Betty to death. In this situation, 

          Betty&#8217;s death was brought about through Wilma and Barney&#8217;s 

          concurrent actions. However, if their actions had not been concurrent, 

          the result would have been the same. Had Wilma attacked Betty without 

          Barney, Betty would have died when she did and how she did. And so, 

          theoretically, Barney&#8217;s actions were not enough to establish &quot;but 

          for&quot; causation. On the other hand, had Barney attacked Betty without 

          Wilma, Betty would have died when she did and how she did as well and 

          so, theoretically, Wilma&#8217;s actions are not enough to establish 

          but for causation. However, because Wilma and Barney&#8217;s actions 

          are concurrent sufficient causes, they will both be considered the factual 

          cause of Betty&#8217;s death. </p>

        <p class="bodytext">The second exception to the &#8220;but for&#8221; 

          rule is where the chain of events that the defendant&#8217;s actions 

          set in motion comes to rest in a position of apparent safety (in other 

          words, it would appear to an observer that there is no longer a danger 

          that the defendant's actions will cause the harm). If this happens, 

          anything that occurs later as a result of the act will not be regarded 

          as having been caused by the defendant. For example:</p>

        <p><span class="bodytextColor">After leading the Boston Red Sox to their 

          first World Series championship in eighty- five years, Ramon Garcia 

          climbs to the fiftieth floor of the Prudential Center and throws the 

          bat he used to get the game winning hit out the window. Luckily, the 

          bat lands in a tree and nobody is hurt. A few hours later a stiff breeze 

          blows the bat out of the tree. Unfortunately George is sitting under 

          the tree when the bat falls. The bat hits George in the head, fracturing 

          his skull, and George dies of his injuries a few days later. Had the 

          bat hit George directly after Ramon threw it, Ramon&#8217;s action would 

          have been considered the &#8220;but for&#8221; cause of George&#8217;s 

          death. However, because the bat came to rest in a position of apparent 

          safety in the tree, Ramon&#8217;s actions will not be considered the 

          &#8220;but for&#8221; causation of George&#8217;s injuries. This is 

          true in spite of the fact that, obviously, but for the fact that Ramon 

          dropped the bat, George would not have died.</span></p>

        <p class="bodytext">Even if the prosecutor can prove factual causation, 

          he will not get a conviction unless he can prove proximate causation 

          as well. Typically, proximate cause issues arise where an expected result 

          comes about in an unexpected manner. The general rule is that the defendant&#8217;s 

          actions will be regarded as the proximate cause of a result if the result 

          occurred as a &#8220;natural and probable consequence&#8221; of the 

          acts, and there was no intervening factor sufficient enough to break 

          the chain of causation. See People 

          v. Geiger, 159 N.W.2d 383 (Mich. 1968). For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">Enraged that Betty has married her ex-husband, 

          Wilma buys a gun and hides behind some bushes in front of Betty&#8217;s 

          house. When Betty emerges, Wilma shoots Betty, hitting her in the arm. 

          Betty turns and tries to run from Wilma, but in doing so she trips and 

          hits her head on the sidewalk breaking her skull. Betty dies of her 

          injuries a few minutes later. Although Wilma did not anticipate causing 

          Betty&#8217;s death in this manner (Wilma might not have intended to 

          cause Betty&#8217;s death at all), Betty&#8217;s death nevertheless 

          was the natural and probable consequence of Wilma&#8217;s action (since 

          it is natural for someone who is being shot at to try to run away) and 

          since there were no intervening factors breaking the chain of causation, 

          Wilma&#8217;s act will be considered the proximate cause of Betty&#8217;s 

          death. </p>

        <p class="bodytext">As we just mentioned, proximate cause will not attach 

          if a superceding factor breaks the chain of causation between the defendant&#8217;s 

          act and the result of the act. By definition, a superceding factor must 

          be set in motion after the defendant has committed his act. Thus, a 

          pre-existing condition cannot be a superceding factor and will not break 

          the chain of causation. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"> Wilma and Barney hatch a plan to kidnap Betty, 

          drive her out into the middle of the desert and leave her there. As 

          Betty is leaving her house one morning, Wilma drives up, Barney jumps 

          out of the car, grabs Betty, stuffs her in the trunk, and then Wilma 

          and Barney drive off. What Wilma and Barney don&#8217;t know is that 

          Betty has a heart condition. As a result of the fright caused by Wilma 

          and Barney&#8217;s actions, Betty suffers a heart attack and dies while 

          still in the trunk of the car. In this case Betty&#8217;s heart condition 

          is considered a pre-existing condition and, as such, it can not be considered 

          a superceding factor that breaks the causation between Wilma and Barney&#8217;s 

          act of kidnapping and Betty&#8217;s death. Therefore, the kidnapping 

          is the proximate cause of Betty&#8217;s death.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">Additionally, the intervening factor that breaks the 

          chain of causation must be unforeseeable to the defendant at the time 

          of his action. See People v. 

          Herbert, 228 Cal. App. 2d 514 (1964). As in tort law, negligent 

          medical treatment is considered a foreseeable result of the defendant&#8217;s 

          actions. Therefore, if the defendant&#8217;s actions put the victim 

          in the hospital, and the victim suffers further harm as a result of 

          negligent medical treatment, the defendant&#8217;s actions that put 

          the victim in the hospital will be considered the proximate cause of 

          that additional harm as well. However, grossly negligent medical treatment 

          is not considered foreseeable. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"> Wilma and Barney kidnap Betty, drive her to 

          the middle of the desert, and leave her there. Betty manages to return 

          home. However, she is severely dehydrated and sunburned by the time 

          she returns. She is also suffering from a broken ankle which must be 

          operated on. Unfortunately, the doctors at the hospital operate on the 

          wrong leg. In this situation, Wilma and Barney&#8217;s actions will 

          be considered the proximate cause of whatever Betty suffers as a result 

          of the doctor&#8217;s negligence, because medical malpractice is considered 

          a foreseeable intervening factor. However, had the doctors amputated 

          Betty&#8217;s leg, when, clearly amputation was not required to fix 

          the problem, Wilma and Barney&#8217;s actions would not be considered 

          the proximate cause of the amputation because that would be considered 

          gross negligence on the doctor&#8217;s part, and gross negligence is 

          not considered foreseeable. See 

          State v. Clark, 248 A.2d 559 (N.J. 1968). </p>

        <p class="bodytext">Intervening diseases contracted by the victim that 

          are not directly related to the injury inflicted by the defendant are 

          also not considered foreseeable. Therefore, had Betty contracted an 

          illness unrelated to the broken ankle while in the hospital, Wilma and 

          Barney&#8217;s actions would not be considered the proximate cause of 

          Betty getting the illness (even though Wilma and Barney are the reasons 

          that she is in the hospital). See Bush 

          v. Commonwealth, 78 Ky. 268 (1880). </p>

        <p class="bodytext">Finally, certain acts committed by the victim himself 

          will be considered foreseeable. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"> Betty escapes from Wilma and Barney and tries 

          to run away from them. While running away, she runs across the street 

          and gets hit by a car. Wilma and Barney&#8217;s actions will be considered 

          the proximate cause of Betty&#8217;s injuries because a victim running 

          away from her captors is considered a foreseeable response. However, 

          if Betty successfully escapes and later, depressed because she's had 

          a really bad week (being kidnapped and all), throws herself in front 

          of an oncoming truck just to &quot;end it all,&quot; this would be considered 

          an unforeseeable act and Wilma and Barney would not be guilty of homicide.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">Finally, in order to break the chain of causation, 

          the intervening factor must be the sole and dominant cause of the result. 

          If the intervening factor only combines with the effects of the victim&#8217;s 

          conduct, they are considered concurrent proximate causes and the chain 

          of proximate causation is not broken. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">1) After coming out of her house one morning, 

          Betty is attacked and beaten almost to death by Wilma. Jack Kavorkian 

          is a well-respected physician who happens to be walking by and sees 

          Betty lying in the street. Dr. Kavorkian examines Betty and knows for 

          a medical certainty that Betty will die within the next few hours regardless 

          of the medical attention she receives. Betty is in tremendous pain and 

          Dr. Kavorkian decides to put her out of her misery. He pulls out his 

          medical kit and injects Betty with some poison that he carries around 

          in case of an emergency. In this case, even though Betty technically 

          dies because Dr. Kavorkian poisoned her, Wilma can also be convicted 

          for Betty&#8217;s death (in addition to Dr. Kavorkian) because Dr. Kavorkian&#8217;s 

          action is not the sole cause of Betty&#8217;s death. Betty would have 

          died anyway. All Dr. Kavorkian did was speed it up. That being the case, 

          Dr. Kavorkian&#8217;s actions simply combined with Wilma&#8217;s actions 

          to cause Betty&#8217;s death. Therefore they are considered concurrent 

          proximate causes and both of them can be convicted.</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">2) After coming out of her house one morning, 

          Betty is attacked by Wilma. Jack Kavorkian is a well-respected physician 

          who happens to be walking by and sees Betty lying in the street. Dr. 

          Kavorkian examines Betty and determines that Betty is suffering from 

          a broken leg and nothing more. Betty is in tremendous pain and Dr. Kavorkian 

          decides to put her out of her misery. He pulls out his medical kit and 

          injects Betty with some poison that he carries around in case of an 

          emergency. Betty dies a few minutes later. In this case, Dr. Kavorkian&#8217;s 

          actions are the sole and dominant cause of Betty&#8217;s death. It is 

          true that Wilma has injured Betty. However, Wilma did not injure Betty 

          fatally. Therefore, were it not for Dr. Kavorkian&#8217;s actions, Betty 

          would not have died. Since his action is the sole and dominant cause 

          of the result, the chain of proximate causation is broken, and Wilma&#8217;s 

          actions will no longer be considered the proximate cause of Betty&#8217;s 

          death. Therefore, only Dr. Kevorkian is guilty of homicide. Wilma, though 

          she is guilty of other crimes (perhaps aggravated assault), is not guilty 

          of homicide.</p>
