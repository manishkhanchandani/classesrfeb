      <td><p class="bodytext">Mens rea, or &quot;guilty&quot; intent, deals with 

          what the defendant needs to have been thinking at the time he or she 

          committed the actus reus for criminal liability to attach. In order 

          to be guilty of most crimes, the defendant must have had the mens rea 

          required for the crime he was committing at the time he committed the 

          criminal act. As with the actus reus, there is no single mens rea that 

          is required for all crimes. Rather, it will be different for each specific 

          crime.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">Please note that the mens rea is not the same thing 

          as motive. The mens rea refers to the intent with which the defendant 

          acted when committing his criminal act. On the other hand, the motive 

          refers to the reason that the defendant committed his criminal act. 

          For example: </p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">1) Fred and Wilma have been married for twenty 

          years. Recently, Fred has begun to suspect that Wilma is having an affair 

          with Barney. Enraged that his wife might be cheating on him, Fred buys 

          a gun and shoots Wilma to death. In this case, Fred&#8217;s criminal 

          act was shooting the gun at Wilma, and his mens rea, his intent, was 

          to kill her. The motive was because he was angry that she might be having 

          an affair.</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">2) Fred and Wilma have been married for fifty 

          years. Recently, Wilma has been diagnosed with terminal cancer, and 

          while she has no chance of surviving the cancer, she will live out the 

          rest of her days in terrible pain. One day, tired of being in pain, 

          Wilma begs Fred to put her out of her misery. Fred loves Wilma and will 

          do anything for her. So, he gets a gun, says his goodbye, and shoots 

          her. In this case, Fred&#8217;s criminal act was shooting the gun at 

          Wilma. His mens rea was to kill her. His motive was to put her out of 

          her misery. Note that even though Fred&#8217;s motive here was a &#8220;good&#8221; 

          one, he can nevertheless be convicted of a homicide. </p>

        <p class="bodytext">It is very important to remember that motive is not 

          an element to the crime. Although a prosecutor will almost certainly 

          want to prove that the defendant had a motive for committing the crime 

          in order to strengthen the prosecution's argument that the defendant 

          did commit the crime, proving motive is not essential to proving criminal 

          liability. In fact, if a prosecutor can prove motive and not mens rea, 

          the defendant must be acquitted no matter how bad the motive is. Conversely, 

          as we have seen with the above example, if the prosecution can prove 

          the mens rea along with the actus reus, the defendant will be convicted 

          no matter how good or noble his motive might have been. See State 

          v. Asher, 8 S.W. 177 (Ark. 1888).</p>

        <p class="bodytext">Mens rea is traditionally divided into four separate 

          categories: general intent, specific intent, recklessness and criminal 

          negligence. Additionally, certain statutory crimes may require malice 

          or willfulness or other such terms (which have not really been clearly 

          defined) that we will examine shortly.</p>

        <p class="heading3">General Intent</p>

        <p class="bodytext">General intent crimes require that the defendant

          has  intended to commit an illegal act. As such, the only state of

          mind that  will suffice for a conviction is an intent to commit the

          act that constitutes  the crime. If this has been established, the

          defendant can be convicted  even if he never intended to violate the

          law, and even if he did not  know that his act was criminal. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">The crime &quot;mayhem,&quot; which we will discuss 

          in more depth a little bit later in the course, is loosely defined as 

          the intentional disfigurement or maiming of another person. Since mayhem 

          is a general intent crime, all the prosecution has to prove to secure 

          a conviction is that the defendant intentionally committed the act that 

          resulted in the victim&#8217;s disfigurement. In such a situation, the 

          defendant will be convicted even if he did not intend to break the law 

          with his actions and even if he did not know that his actions were illegal. 

          Let&#8217;s assume that Defendant throws battery acid into Victim&#8217;s 

          face and disfigures him. In order to secure a conviction, the prosecution 

          will have to prove that Defendant intentionally threw the acid into 

          Victim&#8217;s face. If the prosecution successfully proves this, Defendant 

          can be convicted even if he did not intend to disfigure the victim and 

          even if he did not know that disfiguring somebody was illegal. In other 

          words, Defendant can be convicted for the general intent of throwing 

          the acid in the victim&#8217;s face even if he did not have the specific 

          intent of actually disfiguring the victim. For general intent crimes, 

          under which this example fits, we don&#8217;t care what the defendant&#8217;s 

          specific intent was. As long as the general intent of throwing acid 

          in the victim&#8217;s face was there, he can be convicted of mayhem.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">Note that with regard to general intent crimes, intent 

          does not have to be specifically proven. This would be a near impossible 

          thing to do since there is no way to allow the jury to see the defendant's 

          thought processes. Rather, intent can be inferred from the commission 

          of the act itself and the surrounding circumstances. In other words, 

          it can be presumed that the defendant intended to commit an act by virtue 

          of the fact that he voluntarily committed it. See State 

          v. Carlson, 93 N.W.2d 354 (Wis. 1958) </p>

        <p class="heading3">Specific Intent</p>

        <p class="bodytext">Specific intent crimes require proof of the general 

          intent to commit the illegal acts and proof of intent above and beyond 

          the general intent to commit the illegal acts. In other words, beyond 

          proving that the defendant had the intent to commit the illegal act, 

          the prosecution must prove that the defendant had intent to achieve 

          a specific goal in addition to the intent to commit the illegal acts. 

          For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">Common law burglary, as we will discuss later 

          in this course, is defined as the breaking and entering of the dwelling 

          of another person at night with the intent to commit a felony therein. 

          If burglary were a general intent crime, all the prosecutor would have 

          to do to secure a conviction would be to prove that the defendant intended 

          to break and enter into someone&#8217;s dwelling at night. After that, 

          we would not care what the defendant&#8217;s intent was. As long as 

          he satisfied the general intent requirement in that he intended to break 

          into the house, he could be convicted. However, because burglary is 

          a specific intent crime, something more is required, and that is the 

          intent to actually commit a felony once inside the dwelling. If the 

          prosecution could only prove that the defendant intended to break and 

          enter into a dwelling of another and he could prove nothing more, the 

          defendant would have to be acquitted because, above and beyond the prosecution&#8217;s 

          requirement to prove the general intent of breaking and entering, the 

          prosecutor must also prove that the defendant had the specific intent 

          to commit a felony once he broke into the house. Because this specific 

          intent is an actual element of the crime, burglary is called a specific 

          intent crime.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">Unlike general intent, specific intent cannot be inferred 

          from the commission of the act. Rather, specific proof is required to 

          demonstrate specific intent. See Sullateskee 

          v. State, 428 P.2d 736 (Okla. 1967).</p>

        <p class="heading3">Recklessness and Criminal Negligence</p>

        <p class="bodytext">For some crimes, a conviction can be based on a showing 

          of recklessness or criminal negligence. Both of these terms refer to 

          scenarios in which the defendant did not intend to commit the crime 

          but was not careful enough with his or her actions in avoiding the criminal 

          result. In these cases, the defendant can be convicted for an act done 

          without the intent required for specific and general intent crimes, 

          but rather, with a showing that the defendant acted with a gross lack 

          of care. The difference between recklessness and negligence is a matter 

          of degree, with recklessness being the higher level of guilt. Some of 

          the most common examples of crimes that can be committed through recklessness 

          or criminal negligence are involuntary manslaughter, criminally negligent 

          homicide and, as the name implies, reckless endangerment. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">(1) One evening, Driver gets wasted at his local 

          bar by drinking seven beers and then gets into his car and drives home. 

          On the way home, Driver, predictably, loses control of his car and runs 

          down a pedestrian, killing him. In many states, Driver has committed 

          involuntary manslaughter. By getting behind the wheel while drunk, Driver 

          exhibited reckless behavior. He can be convicted of reckless homicide 

          despite his lack of intention to kill anyone.</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">(2) While out on parole, Driver gets back into 

          his car. Having learned his lesson about drunk driving, he is completely 

          sober this time. However, he has not learned his lesson about driving 

          carefully in general. While cruising at 55 miles per hour through a 

          hospital zone (speed limit 15 MPH), he kills another pedestrian. Although 

          Driver's conduct probably does not rise to the level of recklessness, 

          he can still probably be liable for criminally negligent homicide, since 

          it could reasonably be argued that driving at 40 miles per hour above 

          the speed limit constitutes gross negligence.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">Certain crimes define the requisite mens rea in terms 

          of &#8220;malice&#8221; or &#8220;willfulness&#8221;. However, these 

          terms have no generally agreed upon meaning.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">For both the general intent and the specific intent 

          crimes, the United States Constitution mandates that the burden of proof 

          is on the prosecution to prove both the elements of the crime and the 

          intent required by the criminal statute beyond a reasonable doubt. If 

          no intent is spelled out in a criminal statute, the crime is presumed 

          to be a general intent crime.</p>

        <p class="heading3">Strict Liability</p>

        <p class="bodytext">Along with the general intent and specific intent 

          crimes is a class of strict liability crimes. Strict liability crimes 

          are the crimes for which a defendant can be convicted even if he did 

          not have any mens rea at all when he was committing the crime. Statutory 

          rape and bigamy are the two popular examples of strict liability crimes. 

          For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">Fred and Wilma have been married for several 

          years when they mutually decide to file for divorce. Fred hires a divorce 

          attorney and does what he needs to do to legally divorce Wilma. Unfortunately, 

          due to some technical mistakes, the divorce is not valid and, although 

          Fred doesn&#8217;t know it, he is still legally married to Wilma. One 

          year later, Fred marries Betty. If Fred lives in a state where bigamy 

          is illegal, he can be prosecuted and convicted for committing the crime, 

          even though he had no criminal intent whatsoever when he married Betty. 

          The fact that bigamy is a strict liability crime means that Fred can 

          be convicted anyway because for strict liability crimes, there is no 

          requirement of a <i>mens rea</i>.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">Typically, whether a crime is strict liability or 

          not will depend on what the legislature intended when they passed the 

          specific criminal statute. <br>
