          A proposed criminal code drafted by the American Law Institute that 

          states may choose to adopt as their criminal law. Some states have adopted 

          the Model Penal Code in its entirety as their criminal law, others have 

          adopted parts of the Model Penal Code; while some states have completely 

          ignored it.<br>

      <td><p class="bodytext">The Model Penal Code recognizes four different levels 

          of <i>mens rea</i>: purpose (same as intent), knowledge, recklessness 

          and negligence. </p>

        <p class="bodytext">The key feature added by the Model Penal Code's system 

          is that for any criminal statute, unless the statute specifically states 

          otherwise, the defendant must commit all elements of the crime with 

          a mental state of recklessness or greater (ie. recklessness, knowledge 

          of purpose). </p>

        <p class="bodytextEmph">1. Purpose</p>

        <p class="bodytext">A person acts purposefully (intentionally) if he acts 

          with the intent that his action causes a certain result. In other words, 

          the defendant undertakes his action either intending for, or hoping 

          that, a certain result will follow.</p>

        <p class="bodytextEmph">2. Knowledge</p>

        <p class="bodytext">A person acts knowingly if he is aware that his conduct 

          will result in certain consequences. In other words, a person acts knowingly 

          if he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will 

          cause a specific result.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">The difference between acting intentionally and acting 

          knowingly is somewhat subtle, but the following example should clear 

          it up a little. </p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"> Fred and his new wife, Betty, decide to go to 

          Hawaii on their honeymoon. Wilma, Fred&#8217;s jealous ex-wife finds 

          out what flight they are on and plants a bomb on the plane with the 

          intent of killing Fred and Betty. Wilma knows that there will be ninety-eight 

          other passengers on the flight and, though she feels bad that they will 

          die too, her hatred of Fred and Betty is so strong that she decides 

          to proceed with her plan anyway. Sure enough, the bomb explodes in the 

          middle of the flight, and all one hundred people on board are killed. 

          According to the Model Penal Code&#8217;s breakdown of mens rea, Wilma 

          has intentionally killed Fred and Betty because she acted with the intent 

          that Fred and Betty would die. However, Wilma only acted knowingly with 

          regard to the killings of the other ninety-eight passengers because, 

          although it was not her intent to kill them, she acted knowing that 

          her actions would result in their deaths. In other words, with respect 

          to Fred and Betty, Wilma acted with the desire to cause their deaths, 

          but with respect to the other ninety-eight passengers, Wilma acted not 

          with the desire to cause their deaths, but with the knowledge that their 

          deaths would result from her actions.</p>

        <p class="bodytextEmph">3. Recklessness</p>

        <p class="bodytext">A person acts recklessly if he is aware of a substantial 

          risk that a certain result will occur as a result of his actions. The 

          risk must be substantial enough that the action represents a gross deviation 

          from what a reasonable law abiding person would do.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">The difference between recklessness and knowledge 

          is that where a person acts knowingly he acts with the certainty that 

          a certain result will follow from his actions. However, where a person 

          acts recklessly, the person does not know for sure that a specific result 

          will follow. Rather, he only knows that there is a substantial risk 

          that the result will follow. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">Fred and his new wife, Betty, decide to go to 

          Hawaii on their honeymoon. Wilma, Fred&#8217;s jealous ex-wife, finds 

          out what airline they are taking and what day they are flying and what 

          plane they will be flying on, and she plants a bomb on that plane. Wilma 

          has no idea what time the flight takes off, but she sets the bomb to 

          go off at 7:00 in the morning. Sure enough, the bomb goes off at 7:00 

          in the morning, killing a baggage handler who is loading luggage onto 

          the plane. In this case, Wilma has not purposefully killed the baggage 

          handler since it was not her intent to kill him. Further, she did not 

          knowingly kill him because it was not certain that the baggage handler&#8217;s 

          death would result from Wilma&#8217;s actions. However, because there 

          was a substantial and unjustified risk that Wilma&#8217;s actions would 

          result in someone&#8217;s death or serious injury, she has acted recklessly.</p>

        <p class="bodytextEmph">4. Negligence</p>

        <p class="bodytext">A person acts negligently if they should have been 

          aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that a certain consequence 

          would result from their actions. Although the level of risk is the same 

          for both recklessness and negligence, the difference between the two 

          is that with recklessness, the actor must be aware of the risk involved 

          with her actions, whereas, for negligence, the actor is not aware of 

          the risks but should have known what those risks were. In other words, 

          where Wilma sets the bomb off to go at 8:30, knowing that there is a 

          risk that someone might get killed, she has acted recklessly. However, 

          if for some reason, she doesn&#8217;t recognize that someone might get 

          killed, she has acted negligently because a reasonable person would 

          be aware that someone could get killed if they were to put a bomb on 

          an airplane.</p>

        <p class="heading3">Concurrence of the Actus Reus and Mens Rea</p>

        <p class="bodytext">As you can probably imagine, there must be a concurrence 

          between the mens rea and the act or result required by the crime that 

          the defendant has committed. In other words, in order to be convicted 

          of a crime the defendant must have had the requisite intent at the moment 

          he performed the act. This is called the concurrence rule. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"> As we will discuss later on in this course the 

          crime of burglary is defined as the breaking and entering into the dwelling 

          of another at night with the intent of committing a felony therein. 

          According to the concurrence rule, in order for the defendant to be 

          convicted of burglary, the prosecution must show that the defendant 

          intended to commit a felony at the time he broke in to the dwelling. 

          In other words, if Fred breaks into Barney&#8217;s house and steals 

          Barney&#8217;s bowling ball, the prosecution will have to prove that 

          Fred intended to steal the bowling ball when he broke into Barney&#8217;s 

          house. If, however, Fred is a homeless person and breaks into Barney&#8217;s 

          house on a cold night with the intent of simply warming up and only 

          then, after he has broken into the house, decides to steal the bowling 

          ball, Fred will not be convicted of burglary because there is no concurrence 

          between his act of breaking and entering and his intent. See Jackson 

          v. State, 15 So. 344 (Ala. 1894).</p>

        <p class="bodytext">Where the relationship between the mens rea and the 

          result are at issue because the crime in question requires that there 

          be concurrence between the mens rea and the result (as opposed to the 

          act), the prosecution must show that the result was attributable to 

          the mens rea in order to sustain a conviction. Typically, the prosecution 

          will sustain a conviction if they can show that the defendant intended 

          for the result to occur at the time he committed his act. For example:</p>

        <p> <span class="bodytextColor">Fred and his new wife, Betty, decide to 

          go to Hawaii for their honeymoon. Wilma, Fred&#8217;s jealous ex-wife, 

          finds out which plane Fred and Betty will be taking and she plants a 

          bomb on the plane with the intention of killing Fred and Betty. Before 

          the flight takes off, Wilma has a change of heart and tries to alert 

          the airline that there is a bomb on the plane. She fails. The plane 

          takes off, and the bomb explodes, killing Fred, Betty and everyone else 

          on the plane. Since Wilma intended for Fred and Betty to die when she 

          planted the bomb on the plane, the required concurrence between Wilma&#8217;s 

          mens rea and the result of her actions exists here. I</span><span class="bodytextColor">t 

          is not essential that the intent and the result occur at the same time. 

          In this case, when the result occurred, Wilma did not have the intent 

          that she had when she planted the bomb. However, it only needs to be 

          shown that the result was attributable to the intent for the concurrence 

          to exist.</span></p></td>
