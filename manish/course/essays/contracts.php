      <td valign="top">Sara is a doctor who collects, buys, sells, and trades baseball cards for profit, averaging 15 transactions a week. She is a recognized expert in the 1939-50 era.<br>
        Bill operates a store that regularly sells baseball cards. Bill claims he phoned Sara and offered to buy a 1939 Denny Wilson card for $550, and that Sara accepted.<br>
        Immediately after their phone conversation, Bill sent Sara an unsigned, typed letter confirming the contract, and identifying the parties, the Denny Wilson card and the price. Bill’s letter had a letterhead identifying the name of his business, Beyer’s Baseball Cards and Collectibles. The letter included the following term: “Seller shall provide a certificate of authenticity from the Baseball Trading Cards Association.” Certificates of authenticity cost $100 and significantly increase a card’s value. Sara’s card was not certified, and the parties had not discussed this before.<br>
        Sara received and read the letter but did not respond to it. When Bill called later, Sara said she had sold the card to another party for $575. Bill sued Sara for breach of contract, seeking $250 in damages (based on $800 as the fair market value of a certified card).<br>
        Sara denies the existence of a contract, alleging that Bill only asked, “Would you consider taking $550” for the card, and that she replied, “Okay, send me something in writing.” Alternatively, she claims that the phone agreement was unenforceable and that the so-called letter of confirmation had no legal effect. She also contests Bill’s calculation of damages.<br>
        1. Can Bill prevail in his lawsuit? Discuss.<br>
      2. If so, what damages, if any, is Bill entitled to recover? Discuss.</td>

        <li>Contracts for the sale of goods, which are tangible, movable items will be governed by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).</li>
        <li>Where parties to a contract hold themselves out to be experts or as having specialized knowledge in the area of which the contract pertains the parties will be seen as merchants and held to a higher standard of good faith and fair dealing and the sections of the UCC pertaining specifically to Merchants will apply.</li>
        <li>Supra</li>
        <li>For there to be a valid, enforceable contract the plaintiff must show that there was mutual assent, offer and acceptance, backed by consideration and that no valid defenses exist.</li>
        <li>An outward manifestation of present contractual intent to be bound by the terms which are definite and certain effectively communicated to the offeree creating the power of acceptance.</li>
      </ol></td>
      <td valign="top"><ol>
        <li>Here, the contract is for the sale of a 1939 Denny Wilson baseball card which is a good.</li>
        <li>Here, Sara is a doctor who collects, buys, sells and trades baseball cards for a profit averaging 15 transactions a week and is a recognized expert in the 1939-50 era. Typically, collectors will not be seen as merchants especially when they make their living by other means, as evidenced here in that Sara is a doctor, but Sara's recognition of being an &quot;expert in the 1939-50 era&quot; along with her frequency of transactions, 15 transactions a week will likely place her in the eyes of the court as a merchant since a typical collector, non-merchant, would not be recognized as an expert nor would they engage in 15 transactions a week. Further Sara's expertise pertains to the contract in question, a 1939 Denny Wilson card.</li>
        <li>Bill operates a store that regularly sells baseball cards. Bill's business is that of selling baseball cards and will also be seen as a merchant.</li>
        <li>NA</li>
        <li>Here Bill will argue that he phoned Sara and offered to buy a 1939 Denny Wilson card for $550. Under the UCC only the quantity is required to establish a valid offer but here we have most of the essential terms as follows:<br>
          Quantity - 1 baseball card<br>
          Identity of parties - Bill and Sara<br>
          Price - $550<br>
          Subject matter - 1939 Denny Wilson baseball card<br>
          The only material term which is not given in the facts is that of time for performance; under the UCC a reasonable time will be imputed as a gap filler.<br>
          The offer was communicated to Sara, the offeree, by telephone and thus created the power of acceptance.<br>
          <br>
          Sara will argue that Bill only asked &quot;would you consider taking $550&quot; for the card and that she replied okay send me something in writing, which she will argue would be a written offer as contracts for the sale of goods in excess of $500 need to be in writing.<br>
          The court will have to decide whether or not Bill's phone call to Sara was in fact an offer or an invitation to negotiate. It is likely that under either party's interpretation of the phone call a valid offer was made because Sara's saying &quot;okay&quot; to Bill's alleged question of &quot;would you consider taking $550&quot; will equate to an acceptance and mere acknowledgement of the Statute of Frauds requirement that it be in writing.<br>
        </li>
      </ol></td>
      <td valign="top"><ol>
        <li>Therefore, UCC applies.</li>
        <li>Therefore Sara will be seen as a merchant.</li>
        <li>Therefore, both parties will be seen as merchants.</li>
        <li>NA</li>
        <li>Therefore, valid offer.</li>

      <td valign="top">Painter and Developer entered into a contract under the terms of which Painter was to paint the interior of Developer’s new apartment building for a price of $40,000. The contract called for work to begin on June 1 and to be completed on July 1.<br>
        Painter was ready to start work on June 1, but Developer told Painter that because of problems with the drywall contractor, Painter could not start work until June 15. To avoid the possibility of losing her employees, who might quit if forced to take a two-week layoff, Painter took another job, which was not completed until June 20, at which time Painter started work on Developer’s building.<br>
        On July 15, Painter informed Developer that she would not be able to complete the project until August 15. Developer told her he would lose substantial rental income if the project was not completed by August 1, when university students, his prime market, began moving in. He asked her to hire additional help, but she refused, saying the job would be finished on August 15 or not at all. In an attempt to get the job completed sooner, Developer fired Painter and looked for another painting contractor.<br>
        The best price Developer could get to have another painting contractor finish the job was $30,000. Before firing Painter, Developer had paid Painter one-half of the contract price. Because the painting was completed late, Developer lost $10,000 in rental income. This rental income would not have been lost if the painting had been completed by August 1.<br>
        At the time Painter was fired, she was out-of-pocket for $5,000 in materials. She expected a profit of $5,000 had she been allowed to complete the contract.<br>
        Developer has sued Painter for breach of contract. Painter cross-complained against Developer for breach of contract.<br>
        1. Who breached the contract? Discuss.<br>
        2. Assuming Painter breached the contract, what damages, if any, would Developer be entitled to? Discuss.<br>
      3. Assuming Developer breached the contract, what damages, if any, would Painter be entitled to? Discuss.</td>

      <td valign="top">October 2015</td>
      <td valign="top">Jack, a retiree, plans to build a new home on his vacant property. He decided to use a particular product called “Austin Brown Stone” for the exterior walls, and estimated he would need about 100 tons of stone.<br>
        Jack drafted a contract to present to Stone-Co, a local stone distributor, in which Jack agreed: (i) to buy all the Austin Brown Stone he needs to build the exterior walls of his house, (ii) at a price of $200 per ton, (iii) to be delivered to his property in 5-ton lots within 10 days following each request for 5 tons, (iv) to be paid for upon delivery. To ensure timely deliveries, Jack included a liquidated damages clause which provided that Stone-Co would pay $5,000 per day for each day that any requested delivery is late.<br>
        Jack signed and dropped off the contract to Stone-Co for its review and signature. That evening, the Stone-Co salesperson, knowing that Austin Brown Stone is often not easily obtained, wrote the following just below Jack’s liquidated damages clause: “Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Stone-Co has difficulty getting Austin Brown Stone, Stone-Co may substitute Austin White Stone.”<br>
        The Stone-Co salesperson then signed the contract and returned it to Jack the next day. Jack did not read the modified contract or see the term added by Stone-Co.<br>
        One week later, Jack made a request for the first 5 tons of Austin Brown Stone, and Stone-Co started looking for a supplier. Stone-Co quickly discovered that Austin Brown Stone was not available in the United States. Although it could be imported from Canada, importing it would add $25 per ton to Stone-Co’s expenses and reduce its profit margin.<br>
        Ten days after Jack’s order, Stone-Co delivered Austin White Stone with a note stating that Austin Brown Stone was not available in the U.S., and a demand for payment at the new price of $225 per ton. Jack immediately called the Stone-Co salesperson, stating he would not accept the substitution because Austin White Stone is a completely different product.<br>
        Jack contracted with another supplier for Austin Brown Stone at $225 per ton. Jack thereafter filed a lawsuit against Stone-Co seeking damages for breach of contract and liquidated damages.<br>
        1. What is Jack’s likelihood of success in his lawsuit and what damages, if any, would he be entitled to? Discuss.<br>
      2. What defenses, if any, can Stone-Co reasonably assert? Discuss.</td>

      <td valign="top">Betsy owns a business in South City. Her friend, Walter, lived in Northville, some distance away. Over the years, Betsy had often suggested to Walter that he move to South City and work for her. A short time ago, Walter decided to follow Betsy’s suggestion. He called Betsy and asked if she was still interested in hiring him. Betsy replied, “Of course. Get down here as soon as possible and we can see where you would fit in.” Walter agreed and told her that he would give notice at his current job and would be in South City by the end of the month.<br>
        Walter gave notice at work and shipped his furniture to South City at a cost of $5,000 and bought a one-way plane ticket for $250.<br>
        When Walter called Betsy upon his arrival in South City, she told him that she had just lost a major customer and had to impose rigorous cost-cutting. She therefore could no longer employ him.<br>
        Walter tried for two months to find another job in South City but nothing was available. Walter’s previous employer was willing to rehire him, so he moved back to Northville, paying another $5,000 for movers and $250 for airfare.<br>

No interview or references necessary. The first to apply will be accepted.” She included her phone number.<br>
        Carl called her the next day and said, “I accept on the terms you have offered.” Zena said, “You should know there was a mistake in the advertisement. The pay will be the same, but my house is actually 3000 square feet.”<br>
        Carl said, “Let me think a moment.”<br>
        Zena replied, “I have a call on another line, and I’ll call you right back.” When she called Carl two minutes later, Carl said, “I agree to clean for you on the terms you described. An extra 500 square feet does not matter to me.”<br>

      <td valign="top">Doug, a developer, and Bill, a builder, entered into a contract. Under the contract, Bill was to build a building for Doug for $100,000, and was to receive a $10,000 “on-time bonus” if he were to complete construction by a specified date.<br>
        Bill, in turn, entered into a contract with Ellen, an electrical contractor. Under this contract, Ellen was to do the electrical work for the building for $15,000. At the time she entered into the contract, Ellen was not aware of Bill’s on-time bonus, but learned about it before she was to begin the job.<br>
        In the midst of the job, after receiving $3,000 in progress payments, Ellen decided she could not profitably do the electrical work for $15,000 and quit. Bill looked diligently for an electrical contractor to complete the work at the lowest cost. The only electrical contractor Bill could locate was Roger. Roger demanded $20,000 to complete the work. Bill agreed and paid Roger $20,000 upon completion.<br>
        In spite of Bill’s best efforts, and solely because Ellen had quit the job, Bill completed construction late and, as a result, did not receive the on-time bonus.<br>
        1. Is Ellen liable to Doug for any damages Doug may have incurred as a result of the late completion of the construction? Discuss.<br>
        2. Is Ellen liable to Bill for:<br>
