$data[] = 'Al and his wife Bobbie owned a laundromat and lived in an apartment above it. They
were having significant financial difficulties because the laundromat had been losing
money.
Unbeknownst to Bobbie, Al decided to burn the laundromat down in order to obtain
insurance proceeds. He contacted Ted, who had a reputation for being available to do
“odd jobs.” Ted agreed to set fire to the laundromat the next day for 20 percent of the
insurance proceeds. Al told him that he would call him once everyone was out of the
building.
The next day, Al invited Bobbie out for a walk. While she was getting ready, he
checked the laundromat, found no one there, and called Ted. While Al and Bobbie
were out walking, Bobbie mentioned that, just as she was leaving, her brother Brad had
come by the apartment unexpectedly and was napping on their couch. Al rushed to call
Ted. When he could not reach him, he made an anonymous call to 911 to report a
possible fire at the laundromat.
In the meantime, Ted started a fire that quickly engulfed the laundromat and the
apartment, and killed Brad. After learning of Brad’s death, Al decided not to file a claim
for insurance proceeds.
With what crimes, if any, could Al be charged and what defenses, if any, could he
assert? Discuss.';
