If the court so determines, then A and B may be charged with arson.</p>
    <p>A and B will argue this issue, especially because of the death of Sam as a result of the fire. They will maintain that they did not intend to start the fire and that it was an accident. However, in light of the fact that they were using a blowtorch, it seems<strong> foreseeable that a fire</strong> could start.  B may argue that as a master welder, it was not foreseeable that he would start a fire with the torch.
