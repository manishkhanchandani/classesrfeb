<p>C.<strong> Products Liability</strong></p>
<p><strong>Approach</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>General Products Liability (Can A prevail against B for products liability) ?<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Manufacturer or Reseller</li>
      <li>An Unreasonably Dangerous Product</li>
      <li>Released into the stream of commerce.</li>
      <li>Which caused injury to person or property</li>
      <li>Conclusion: Therefore A may be able to prevail against B in a product liability claim.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Defect (Was the Widget Defective in Design, Manufacture or Warning) ?
    <ol>
      <li>Design Defect</li>
      <li>Manufacture Defect</li>
      <li>Warning defect<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Theories (Can A prevail under the products theory of battery, negligence, breach of warranty, strict liability in torts)?</strong>
<ol>
      <li><strong>Battery</strong><br>
        In order for the plaintiff to recover on a theory of intent (battery), the plaintiff must prove that the manufacturer, distributor or supplier knew the product would cause harm.        <br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Negligence</strong><br>
        In order for a plaintiff to recover under a negligence theory of products liability, the plaintiff will have to prove duty, breach, causation and damages.
<ol>
          <li><strong>Duty</strong><br>
            Originally extended only to those in privity of contract, but under MacPherson v. Buick, the duty was extended to all foreseeable users.            <br>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Breach</strong><br>
          P must show the product failed to meet ordinary commercial expectation          </li>
          <li><strong>Causation</strong><br>
            P must show that D was the actual and proximate cause.
            <ol>
              <li>Actual Cause</li>
              <li>Proximate Cause<br>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Damages</strong><br>
          Limited to personal and property. Punitive available for reckless conduct.          </li>
          <li><strong>MacPherson v. Buick</strong> <br>
          In this landmark case, Justice Cardozo dispensed with the previously applied requirement of privity of contract in products liability cases and extended the manufacturer’s duty of care to include the ultimate consumer of the product, whether or not the consumer was the actual purchaser of the product. Later cases extended the duty to include not just the purchaser or the ultimate consumer, but to include all persons and property likely to be endangered by the product's probable use, such as the consumer's family or guests, or even near bystanders.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Breach of Warranty</strong><br>
        Liability can be imposed against the manufacturer or seller of a product based upon the buyer’s <strong>reliance</strong> upon <strong>express and / or implied warranties</strong> that the goods are of <strong>merchantable quality</strong> and are fit for their <strong>intended purpose</strong>.
        <ol>
          <li>IRAC Breach of Warranty
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Implied promise</strong> by a merchant selling goods that product is fair and average quality, </li>
              <li><strong>Fit </strong>for normal use</li>
              <li>Emphasis is on <strong>safety</strong><br>
                <strong>Example: </strong>The implied warranty relating to a car would likely include that its safety devices (airbag) would protect, not harm, the occupants. A impliedly warranted that the airbag was safe when it sold the car with this safety device.
              Moreover, the addition of the inexpensive safety switch would have added to the reasonableness of the airbag's safety.</li>
              <li><strong>Intended Purpose</strong><br>
                Example: If the seller knows of buyer's intended use, and buyer acting as an average reasonable person, relies upon seller's &quot;special knowledge and skills,&quot; then a breach has occured.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Breach of Warranty</strong>, why it is not safe?<br>
              <strong>Example: </strong>A breached the warranty by equipping the Roadster with an airbag that created a danger to young passengers. </li>
              <li><strong>Privity of contract</strong><br>
              <strong>Example: </strong>Most courts hold that the privity of contract is not required to recover in tort for breach of the implied warranty. A user of a product, like C, can sue, even though she did not purchase the car. </li>
              <li><strong>Causation</strong><br>
                Example: As discussed, breach was the cause in fact and proximate cause of C's head injury.</li>
              <li>Damages</li>
              <li>Defenses<br>
                Example: No defenses.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Strict Liability  </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>D. Strict Liability</strong></p>
<p><strong>Approach</strong></p>
<p><strong>Def: </strong>Liability is imposed irrespective of whether anyone was at fault.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Activity, Rylands vs Fletcher</strong>
<ul>
      <li><strong>Animals</strong>
<ul>
          <li>Type of Animal / type of injury
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Domestic Animals</strong><br>
                One is not strictly liable for injuries caused by a domestic animal (eg. dogs, cats) <strong>unless the defendant has &quot;scienter&quot; or knowledge of the dangerous propensities of the animal</strong>. 
                <ul>
                  <li>Without knowledge of a dangerous propensities, an owner is not liable.</li>
                  <li>Strict liability for physical harm done
                    <ul>
                      <li>The possessor is liable only for injuries attributable to the animal's known dangerous propensity.</li>
                      <li>Normally domestic animals like bull who has normally dangerous propensities is not liable for strict liability.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Wild Animals</strong><br>
                A possessor of a wild animal is subject to liability to another for harm done by the animal to the other, his person, land or chattels, although the possesor has exercised the utmost care to confine the animal or otherwise prevent it from doing harm (non-delegable duty)
                  <ul>
                    <li>Liability is limited to harm that results from a dangerous propensity that is characteristic of wild animals of the particular class.</li>
                    <li>Where wild animals are kept under a public duty, strict liability does not apply as in case of zoo.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Tresspassing livestock:</strong><br>
              Strict liability for trespass / damages.</li>
              <li><strong>Injuries to third parties:</strong>
<ul>
                  <li>Licensees and invitees injured by wild or abnormally dangerous animals may recover in strict liability.</li>
                  <li>The majority of courts hold that <strong>strict liability does not extend to trespassers whose presence the owner had no reason to know of or anticipate </strong>and thus, no recovery may be held for injuries inflicted by the animal.</li>
                  <li>Strict liability will apply<strong> if the landowner had reason to anticipate trespassing</strong> upon the property unless adequate warnings of the animals presence were given. </li>
                  <li>However, trespasser may recover in negligence where the landowner knows of their presence and fails to post warnings.</li>
                  <li>Strict liability recovery<strong> will apply </strong>for injures inflicted by a <strong>vicious watchdogs</strong> unless adequate warnings of the dog's presence were posted.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Ultrahazardous (Abnormally Dangerous) Activities</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>The landmark case of Rylands vs Fletcher, held that a person who brings something onto his land that involves a non natural use of the land and is <strong>likely to cause substantial damage</strong> if it escapes will be strictly liable if it in fact escapes and causes harm.</li>
    <li>Following thinsgs have to be proved:
      <ul>
        <li>Defendant engaged in an <strong>ultrahazardous abnormally dangerous</strong> activity,</li>
        <li>had an absolute duty to <strong>make the activity safe</strong></li>
        <li>was a <strong>foreseeable plaintiff</strong>, </li>
        <li>suffered a <strong>foreseeable harm</strong>,</li>
        <li>the activity was <strong>actual and proximate cause</strong> of his injury and</li>
        <li>he suffered an <strong>actual injury</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>R1 / R2 (factors)</strong>
<ul>
      <li><strong>R1:</strong> Ultrahazardous (1st Restatement) involves a risk of serious harm to the persons or property of others, which cannot be eliminated even by due care, which is not a matter of common usage (utility vs risk) (blasting, drilling, fumigating)</li>
      <li><strong>R2:</strong> One who maintains an abnormally dangerous condition or activity (2nd Restatement) on his or her premises, or engages in an activity that involves a high risk of harm to the persons or property of others may be liable for the harm it causes even though reasonable care to prevent such harm has been exercised, (crop dusting, stored explosives, common carrier transporting abnormally dangerous cargo, transporting a large quantity of highly flammable chemicals in one's auto)
        <ul>
          <li>Factors to consider:
            <ul>
              <li>Whether the activity involves a high degree of risk of harm.</li>
              <li>The gravity of that risk</li>
              <li>Whether the risk can be eliminated by the exercise of reasonable care</li>
              <li><strong>Whether the activity is a matter of common usage;</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Whether the activity is appropriate to the place where it is being carried on; and </strong></li>
              <li><strong>The value of the activity to the community;</strong><br>
                <br>
                Fireworks - negligence
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Absolute Duty to Make Safe</strong><br>
  A strict liability action requires a prima facie showing that defendant <strong>breached an absolute duty to make safe</strong>. </li>
  <li><strong>Foreseeable P / Harm</strong><br>
    Duty owed to foreseeable P's and to the results from the kind of danger to be anticipated (MINK Case). Strict liability is limited to the kind of harm, the possibility of which makes the activity abnormally dangerous.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Causation</strong><br>
    Actual and proximate cause should be argued. Some courts cut off proximate cause when the plaintiff's own act caused the strict liability harm.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Damages</strong><br>
    Harm to plaintiff's person or property. No recovery permitted for a pure economic injury. A pure economic loss is a loss that is not connected with physical injury to property or person.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Defenses</strong><br>
    Assumption of the risk may prevent recovery / comparative negligence applicable in some jurisdictions
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>E. Defamation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Approach</strong></p>

  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>F. Vicarious Liability</strong></p>
<p><strong>Def:</strong> The master is vicariously liable for the torts of servants that occur within the <strong>course and scope </strong>of their employment.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Public Policy</strong><br>
    Public policy demands that employers should bear the risk of loss.
    <ul>
      <li>Look to see if the employee was acting to further his employer's business or to discharge the obligations of his employment.</li>
      <li>Look to the foreseeability of the deviation
        <ul>
          <li>Detour - slight deviation, employer liable</li>
          <li>Frolic - major deviation, employer not liable</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Did the employee commit a foreseeable intentional tort?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Another Servant</strong><br>
  The master who borrows another's servant will be vicariously liable for the torts of that servant.</li>
  <li><strong>Independent Contractors</strong><br>
    General rule no liability to employer unless:
    <ul>
      <li>Inherently dangerous activities (beware of strict liability)</li>
      <li>Non-delegable duties (maintain roads in good repair, maintain automobile, maintain public premises)</li>
      <li><strong>R2 414,</strong> One who entrusts work to an independent contractor, but who retains the control of any part of the work, is subject to liability for physical harm to others for whose safety the employer owes a duty to exercise reasonable care.</li>
      <li><strong>Collateral Negligence Rule:</strong> Emplyer is only responsible for the risks which are inherent in the work, not for the collateral negligence of the independent contractor.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Joint Ventures</strong><br>
    One member of a joint enterprise is vicariously liable to those outside the enterprise for the conduct of another joint enterprisers acting within the scope of the enterprise. 
  Look for an agreement / common purpose (<strong>majority</strong> requires a business purpose) / equal right of voice and control.</li>
  <li><strong>Automobile Cases</strong><br>
    Owner is vicariously liable for injuries resulting from the bailee's negligent operation (third party recoveries)
    <ul>
      <li>Family purpose doctrine</li>
      <li>Permissive use statutes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Bailor / Bailee Relationship</strong><br>
    Bailment's generally involve no vicarious liability, unless lack of due care shown on the part of the bailor
    <ul>
      <li>Negligent entrustment may still apply.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Parent / Child</strong><br>
    A parent is not vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of the child at common law. However, most states, by statute, make parents liable for the willful and intentional torts of their minor children up to a certain dollar amount. Examples include: parent entrusting a child with a dangerous instrumentality, parent knows of the child's wrongdoing and consents or ratifies or the parent fails to exercise proper control over the child.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>If the related party is not vicariously liable, he may be liable for his own negligence (e.g. negligent selection of independent contractor, negligent entrustment of automoble, negligent supervision of child).</p>

<p><strong>Extras</strong></p>
<p>A. Crossovers</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Misrepresentation</strong>
<ul>
      <li><strong>Intentional: Deceit / Fraud</strong><br>
        In order to recover for intentional misrepresentation, or deceit, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant made a <strong>false statement </strong>of <strong>material fact</strong> with <strong>scienter (intent or knowledge)</strong> and with an intent to <strong>induce the plaintiff's reliance</strong>, and that the <strong>plaintiff justifiably relied</strong>, causing the <strong>plaintiff damage</strong>. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Negligent</strong><br>
      In order to recover for negligent misrepresentation, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant <strong>breached his duty to exercise due care in acquiring and transmitting information</strong>, and made a <strong>false statement</strong> of <strong>material fact</strong>, with an intent to <strong>induce the plaintiff's reliance</strong> and that the <strong>plaintiff justifiably relied</strong>, causing the <strong>plaintiff damage</strong>. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Scienter</strong> is misisng in negligent, in negligent it is breach of duty where as in Intentional, it is knowledge.<br>
      <br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Damages</strong>
<ul>
          <li><strong>Out of Pocke tDamages (Misrepresentation)</strong><br>
          Out of Pocket damages are usually considered to be the same thing as <strong>special damages</strong> since they are pecuniary in nature. However, in an action for misrepresentation, out-of-pocket damages are calculated by <strong>comparing the difference between what the plaintiff paid, to the value of what the plaintiff received</strong>. <br>
          <strong>Example</strong> if car is sold for 10,000 and in reality it has problem and value is 4000, so recovery is of 6000 dollars , in case of misrepresentation, if we want full value then sue it for recission.</li>
          <li><strong>Loss of the Benefit of the Bargain Theory (Misrepresentation)</strong><br>
          Under the Loss of the Benefit of the Bargain Theory, special damages for misrepresentation are calculated by <strong>considering the value received by the plaintiff</strong> as compared to the <strong>value that the defendant stated</strong> the plaintiff would receive. <br>
          <strong>Example</strong>: car is sold at $6k and defendant said it is worth $10k, but in reality it is worth $5k, so since he has to pay $5k to plaintiff as 10k - 5k. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Nuisance</strong>
<ul>
      <li><strong>Private Nuisance</strong><br>
      Private nuisance results from an act by the defendant which <strong>unreasonably interferes</strong> with the <strong>plaintiff's use or enjoyment </strong>of his or her <strong>property</strong>. </li>
      <li><strong>Public Nuisance</strong><br>
      Public nuisance results from an <strong>act</strong> or conduct <strong>by the defendant</strong> which is <strong>injurious</strong> to the <strong>public</strong> in general. </li>
    </ul>
