      Conversion is an intentional assumption of dominion and control over the chattel of another, resulting in a substantial interference with the plaintiff's possessory rights.
      
      Intent 
      In order to find out that a tortious act was done with intent, it must be established that the defendant
        1. had a conscious desire that the result would occur, or
        2. knew that the result would occur or
        3. knew that the result was substantially certain to occur.
      
      Substantial Certainity Doctrine
        The Substantical Certainity Doctrine holds that if the defendant does an act with the knowledge that it is substantially certain to produce a particular result, the defendant is deemed to have intended the result and is liable for his act.
      
      Transferred Intent Doctrine
        The Transferred Intent Doctrine is applicable when a defendant, while in the process of committing a tort against one person, unintentionally harms a third person or commits a different tort. In such a case, the defendant's wrongful intent is transferred to include the unintended victim or tortious act.
        
      Trespass Ab Initio
        Trespass ab initio is an entry upon the real property in possession of another under a conferred legal right, and the subsequent abusing of that conferred legal right through the commission of an assault, battery, false imprisonment or trespass.
        
  B. Defenses to Intentional Torts
    1. Consent
      A defendant who acted in accordance with the plaintiff's informed and voluntary assent, whether express or implied, is not liable for the resulting harm so long as the plaintiff had legal capacity.
      A defendant who acted in accordance with the plaintiff's informed and voluntary assent, whether express or implied, is not liable for the resulting harm so long as the plaintiff had legal capacity.
      A defendant who acted in accordance with the plaintiff's informed and voluntary assent, whether express or implied, is not liable for the resulting harm so long as the plaintiff had legal capacity.
      
    2. Self Defense
      A person who reasonable believes himself to be threatened with immediate bodily harm may use whatever degree of force is apparently necessary to protect himself.
      
    3. Defense of Others
      A person who reasonably believes another to be threatened with immediate bodily harm may use whatever degree of force is apparently necessary to protect the personal safety of the other person.
      
      a. Step In Shoes
        In some jurisdictions a person is not allowed to use the defense of "defense of others" unless the person being defended was not the aggressor and had the right to use self-defense.
        
      b. Reasonable Appearances Jurisdictions
        In other jurisdictions, a person defending another in good faith and in ignorance of the fact that the person being defended is the aggressor and not entitled to use self-defense is nevertheless justified when acting upon reasonable apperances. 
        
        Sometime it is futher required that the person being defended is one whom the defender is authorized by statute to protect.
        
    4. Defense of Property
      A person may use reasonable force that is not likely to cause death or serious bodily harm to protect his or her possession of real or personal property against an apparent trespasser.
    
    5. Prevention of Crime
      A person, whether a police officer or a private person, may use reasonable force to prevent the commission of a crime which is apparently being attempted in his or her presence.
      
    6. Recapture of Property
      A person may commit an act which would otherwise be tortious if he or she is acting in fresh pursuit and with a reasonable degree of force to regain possession of his or her property. 
      
      There are three separate aspects to this particular defense:
    
      a. Re-entry Upon Land
      b. Recapture of Chattel
      c. Shopkeeper's Rule
      
    7. Legal Authority
      A person may commit an otherwise tortious act if it is done under legal process or is otherwise authorized by law. 
      
      It is a defence that is usually used by police officers or private persons who have made an arrest either with or without a warrant and who are now facing charges of false imprisonment in relation to their having made the arrest.
      
    8. Necessity
      A person may commit an otherwise tortious act if that person is acting in an emergency situation to protect himself or others from a threatened injurty to a person or property. The person claiming the defense of necessity may act on appearances. A reasonable mistake is permitted.
      
      a. Public Necessity
      b. Private Necessity
      
2. Negligence
    Liability for negligence requires proof of:
      a. a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff,
      b. a breach of that duty, and
      c. that the breach was the actual and proximate cause of
      d. damages suffered by the plaintiff.


  A. Duty
    1. General
      The general rule of duty holds that everyone owes a duty to exercise due care so as not to subject others to unreasonable risks of harm.
      
      a. Cardoza Rule on Duty
        Under Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co., Justice Cardozo's majority opinion held that a defendant owes a duty only to those who could foreseeably be endangered by the defendant's negligent act. There according to the rule, there is no duty owed to a plaintiff who is in a position of apparent safety when the defendant commits a negligent act. This is the so-called "orbit of danger" test.
        
      b. Andrews Rule on Duty
        In the Palsgraf case, Justice Andrews gave a dissenting opinion which has been applied as the majority opinion in other cases. Andrews argued that if the defendant owes a duty to anyone, then he owes a duty to everyone who could foreseeably be injured by his action. Thus, Cardozo looked at the issue from a perspective of identifying whether a duty is owed, while Andrews considered the issue as one of proximate causation.
      
    2. Special
      In addition to the general duty which everyone owes, special duties may be imposed due to a special relationship or circumstance.
