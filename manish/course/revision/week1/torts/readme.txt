      Conversion is an intentional assumption of dominion and control over the chattel of another, resulting in a substantial interference with the plaintiff's possessory rights.
      
      Intent 
      In order to find out that a tortious act was done with intent, it must be established that the defendant
        1. had a conscious desire that the result would occur, or
        2. knew that the result would occur or
        3. knew that the result was substantially certain to occur.
      
      Substantial Certainity Doctrine
        The Substantical Certainity Doctrine holds that if the defendant does an act with the knowledge that it is substantially certain to produce a particular result, the defendant is deemed to have intended the result and is liable for his act.
      
      Transferred Intent Doctrine
        The Transferred Intent Doctrine is applicable when a defendant, while in the process of committing a tort against one person, unintentionally harms a third person or commits a different tort. In such a case, the defendant's wrongful intent is transferred to include the unintended victim or tortious act.
        
      Trespass Ab Initio
        Trespass ab initio is an entry upon the real property in possession of another under a conferred legal right, and the subsequent abusing of that conferred legal right through the commission of an assault, battery, false imprisonment or trespass.
        
  B. Defenses to Intentional Torts
    1. Consent
      A defendant who acted in accordance with the plaintiff's informed and voluntary assent, whether express or implied, is not liable for the resulting harm so long as the plaintiff had legal capacity.
      A defendant who acted in accordance with the plaintiff's informed and voluntary assent, whether express or implied, is not liable for the resulting harm so long as the plaintiff had legal capacity.
      A defendant who acted in accordance with the plaintiff's informed and voluntary assent, whether express or implied, is not liable for the resulting harm so long as the plaintiff had legal capacity.
      
    2. Self Defense
      A person who reasonable believes himself to be threatened with immediate bodily harm may use whatever degree of force is apparently necessary to protect himself.
      
    3. Defense of Others
      A person who reasonably believes another to be threatened with immediate bodily harm may use whatever degree of force is apparently necessary to protect the personal safety of the other person.
      
      a. Step In Shoes
        In some jurisdictions a person is not allowed to use the defense of "defense of others" unless the person being defended was not the aggressor and had the right to use self-defense.
        
      b. Reasonable Appearances Jurisdictions
        In other jurisdictions, a person defending another in good faith and in ignorance of the fact that the person being defended is the aggressor and not entitled to use self-defense is nevertheless justified when acting upon reasonable apperances. 
        
        Sometime it is futher required that the person being defended is one whom the defender is authorized by statute to protect.
        
    4. Defense of Property
      A person may use reasonable force that is not likely to cause death or serious bodily harm to protect his or her possession of real or personal property against an apparent trespasser.
    
    5. Prevention of Crime
      A person, whether a police officer or a private person, may use reasonable force to prevent the commission of a crime which is apparently being attempted in his or her presence.
      
    6. Recapture of Property
      A person may commit an act which would otherwise be tortious if he or she is acting in fresh pursuit and with a reasonable degree of force to regain possession of his or her property. 
      
      There are three separate aspects to this particular defense:
    
      a. Re-entry Upon Land
      b. Recapture of Chattel
      c. Shopkeeper's Rule
      
    7. Legal Authority
      A person may commit an otherwise tortious act if it is done under legal process or is otherwise authorized by law. 
      
      It is a defence that is usually used by police officers or private persons who have made an arrest either with or without a warrant and who are now facing charges of false imprisonment in relation to their having made the arrest.
      
    8. Necessity
      A person may commit an otherwise tortious act if that person is acting in an emergency situation to protect himself or others from a threatened injurty to a person or property. The person claiming the defense of necessity may act on appearances. A reasonable mistake is permitted.
      
      a. Public Necessity
      b. Private Necessity
      
2. Negligence
    Liability for negligence requires proof of:
      a. a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff,
      b. a breach of that duty, and
      c. that the breach was the actual and proximate cause of
      d. damages suffered by the plaintiff.


  A. Duty
    1. General
      The general rule of duty holds that everyone owes a duty to exercise due care so as not to subject others to unreasonable risks of harm.
      
      a. Cardoza Rule on Duty
        Under Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co., Justice Cardozo's majority opinion held that a defendant owes a duty only to those who could foreseeably be endangered by the defendant's negligent act. There according to the rule, there is no duty owed to a plaintiff who is in a position of apparent safety when the defendant commits a negligent act. This is the so-called "orbit of danger" test.
        
      b. Andrews Rule on Duty
        In the Palsgraf case, Justice Andrews gave a dissenting opinion which has been applied as the majority opinion in other cases. Andrews argued that if the defendant owes a duty to anyone, then he owes a duty to everyone who could foreseeably be injured by his action. Thus, Cardozo looked at the issue from a perspective of identifying whether a duty is owed, while Andrews considered the issue as one of proximate causation.
      
    2. Special
      In addition to the general duty which everyone owes, special duties may be imposed due to a special relationship or circumstance.
    
      a. Negligence Per Se
        Under the doctrine of negligence per se, the elements of duty and breach are proven when
        i. a defendant violates a safety statute
        ii. which was intended to protect the class of people to which the plaintiff belongs
        iii. from the kind of injury the defendant caused.
        
        In california, a presumption of negligence arises.
      
      b. Cars / Autos (Drivers of Vehicles)
        Duty Owned to a Guest Passenger
          A driver of a motor vehicle, in the absence of a statute otherwise, owes to persons riding in the vehicle a duty of driving with due care. 
          
          However, a number of jurisdictions have statutes that provide that a guest passenger in an automobile cannot recover from the owner or operator of the automobile unless the owner or operator is guilty of willful misconduct, recklessness, or intoxication.
          
        Duty Owned to a Person Injured by a Drunk Driver
          A person who serves alcoholic beverages to one who is intoxicated is not, in the absence of a statute stating otherwise, liable for the damages done by the intoxicated person. 
          
          However, in those jurisdictions which have statutes traditionally referred to as dram shop acts, an owner, a bartender or other persons serving alcoholic beverages to a person who is intoxicated can be held liable for the foreseeable damages caused by the intoxicated person.
          
        Owner Liability Statutes
          Certain statutes impose liability upon owners of vehicles for the tortious acts committed by persons to whom the owner intentionally furnishes the vehicle.
        
        Family Purpose Doctrine
          A parent who furnishes a vehicle to the members of his or her family for customary convenience, assumes liability for the tortious acts committed by those persons when the car is being driven for a family purpose.
          
      c. Omission to Act (omission is non feasance, i.e. i did not did anything then how am i liable)
        An omission to act to prevent injury, or "nonfeasance" as it is sometimes called, does not give rise to tort liability unless there is a special relationship or special circumstance which creates an affirmative duty requiring the defendant to act to protect the plaintiff.
        
        An affirmative duty to act may arise when there is a close familial relationship, such as 
          parent and child or husband and wife; 
          when the defendant and the plaintiff are co-ventures; 
          when the defendant caused the plaintiff to be in danger or injured; 
          when the defendant has begun to render assistance to the plaintiff; 
          when the defendant fails to perform a duty to control the behavior of others; 
          when the defendant is an innkeeper; or 
          when the defendant operates a common carrier such as a plane or ship.
        
        
      d. Rescuers / Good Samaritans
        i. Duty owed by a good samaritan
          A person who embarks upon the performance of services for another, whether gratuitously or for consideration, is under a duty to render those services with due care.

          This person, however is under no duty to complete the performance of the services unless abondonment would prejudice the other party's position. The rendering of aid in an emergency constitutes the performance of services, and a duty of care is imposed upon those who undertake to render such aid.

          Some jurisdictions have enacted statutes designed to encourage physicians to render emergency aid, by limiting the liability that could otherwise be imposed upon them. Generally speaking, liability can be imposed upon them only for reckless or wanton misconduct.
          
        ii.Duty Owed to a Rescuer
          A person whose negligence creates a situation in which he needs to be rescued may be held liable for injuries incurred by his rescuer.
      
      e. Negligent Supervision /Parents
        i. Child tortfeasors
          Held to duty of reasonable person of child's age and maturity - watch for adult activities.
          
        ii. Negligent Supervision
          Negligent supervision is a cause of action which is brought by a plaintiff who suffered injury because a child or other person was inadequately supervised by one who owed a duty of supervision. Most commonly, it is brought against parents who failed to exercise ordinary parental discretion as to the manner in which their child is supervised or cared for.
          
          Modernly, a child may bring an action against his or her own parents for injuries sustained by the child because of lack of proper supervision.
      
      f. Professionals
        A professional owes a duty of higher care than a layman. A professional owes a duty to act as a reasonable professional in the field.
        
      g. Land Occupier
        i. Invitees, Licensees, Passersby, and Trespassers
          1. Duty Owed to an Invitee
            Invitee: An invitee is a person who has an express or implied invitation to enter property for the purpose for which the propert is maintained.
            
            Business Invitee: A business invitee is a person who has express or implied permission to enter business property to do business with the land occupier.
            
            Public Invitee: A public invitee enters property in the possession of another for the purpose for which the property is held open to the public. It is not required that a business purpose be involved. Public employees acting within the scope of their official duties are included in the category of public invitees.
            
            
            Rule:
            A land occupier owes a duty of ordinary care to invitees, which includes reasonably inspecting the land for dangerous conditions and reqpairing those dangerous conditions which a reasonable inspection would reveal.
            
            Idea:
            Inspect and Correct
            
          2. Dutoy Owed to a Licensee
            Licensee: A licensee is a person who enter sproperty with the express or implied permission of land occupier. Such entry is not for the purpose of oding business.
            
            E.g. if i invite my friend to come to my home for dinner, they are licensee.
            
            Rule:
            A landowner owes a duty of ordinary care to licensees, which includes either:
              i. warning licensees of known dangerous conditions, unless they are obvious or already known to the licensee, or 
              ii. repairing dangerous conditions to make the property safe.
              
          3. Duty Owed to a Trespasser
            Trespasser: A trespasser is a person who enters the real property of another without express or implied consent.
          
            Rule:
            The land occupier generally owes no duty of care to the trespasser unless
              a. the trespasser is a constant trespasser upon a limited area or 
              b. threspasser is a child to whom the Attractive Nuisance Doctrine applies.
          
          
            Duty owed to a Constant Trespasser Upon a Limited Area
              What is Constant Trespasser Upon a Limited Area?
                A constant trespasser upon a limited area is a trespasser whose presence is known or should be known, to land occupier because of the trespasser's repeated acts of trespassing.
                
              Rule:
                The land occupier owes a duty to a constant trespasser upon a limited area of warning him of known dangerous artificial conditions unless such conditions are obvious.
                
                "Warn of artificial conditions unless obvious"
            
            Duty Owed to a Child Trespasser
              The land occupier owes no duty to a child trespasser unless he is a constant trespasser upon a limited area or unless the case is one in which the Attractive Nuisance Doctrine applies.
              
            Attractive Nuisance Doctrine
              The land occupier owes a duty of reasonable care to eliminate a danger or to otherwise protect children when the following elements are present:
                a. foreseeability of trespass,
                b. foreseeability of serious harm,
                c. the child is unaware of the danger and 
                d. the benefit to the owner of maintaining the condition in its dangerous form is slight when weighed against the risk to children.
                
              Element 1:
                Foreseeable Trespass
              
              Element 2:
                Foreseeable serious harm
              
              Element 3:
                Child not aware of danger
              
              Element 4:
                Balance of benefit to risk
                
              Analysis:
                Here, there were many children and hardly any fences in the neighborhood so it seems reasonable to expect that the children might enter nearby neighbors' back yards; thus trespass by children is foreseeable.
                
                Also, since Owen removed a tree which left a deep hole in his back yard, it is foreseeable that a child could fall into the hole and be seriously hurt.
                
                Additionally, 8 year old Carl lived right next door to Owen and fell in the hole, breaking his leg.
                
                Finally, the cost to Owen to voer the hole or at least place markers around it was very little compared to the harm Carl suffered by breaking his leg.
