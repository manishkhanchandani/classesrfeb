      Conversion is an intentional assumption of dominion and control over the chattel of another, resulting in a substantial interference with the plaintiff's possessory rights.
      
      Intent 
      In order to find out that a tortious act was done with intent, it must be established that the defendant
        1. had a conscious desire that the result would occur, or
        2. knew that the result would occur or
        3. knew that the result was substantially certain to occur.
      
      Substantial Certainity Doctrine
        The Substantical Certainity Doctrine holds that if the defendant does an act with the knowledge that it is substantially certain to produce a particular result, the defendant is deemed to have intended the result and is liable for his act.
      
      Transferred Intent Doctrine
        The Transferred Intent Doctrine is applicable when a defendant, while in the process of committing a tort against one person, unintentionally harms a third person or commits a different tort. In such a case, the defendant's wrongful intent is transferred to include the unintended victim or tortious act.
        
      Trespass Ab Initio
        Trespass ab initio is an entry upon the real property in possession of another under a conferred legal right, and the subsequent abusing of that conferred legal right through the commission of an assault, battery, false imprisonment or trespass.
        
  B. Defenses to Intentional Torts
    1. Consent
      A defendant who acted in accordance with the plaintiff's informed and voluntary assent, whether express or implied, is not liable for the resulting harm so long as the plaintiff had legal capacity.
      A defendant who acted in accordance with the plaintiff's informed and voluntary assent, whether express or implied, is not liable for the resulting harm so long as the plaintiff had legal capacity.
      A defendant who acted in accordance with the plaintiff's informed and voluntary assent, whether express or implied, is not liable for the resulting harm so long as the plaintiff had legal capacity.
      
    2. Self Defense
      A person who reasonable believes himself to be threatened with immediate bodily harm may use whatever degree of force is apparently necessary to protect himself.
      
    3. Defense of Others
      A person who reasonably believes another to be threatened with immediate bodily harm may use whatever degree of force is apparently necessary to protect the personal safety of the other person.
      
      a. Step In Shoes
        In some jurisdictions a person is not allowed to use the defense of "defense of others" unless the person being defended was not the aggressor and had the right to use self-defense.
        
      b. Reasonable Appearances Jurisdictions
        In other jurisdictions, a person defending another in good faith and in ignorance of the fact that the person being defended is the aggressor and not entitled to use self-defense is nevertheless justified when acting upon reasonable apperances. 
        
        Sometime it is futher required that the person being defended is one whom the defender is authorized by statute to protect.
        
    4. Defense of Property
      A person may use reasonable force that is not likely to cause death or serious bodily harm to protect his or her possession of real or personal property against an apparent trespasser.
    
    5. Prevention of Crime
      A person, whether a police officer or a private person, may use reasonable force to prevent the commission of a crime which is apparently being attempted in his or her presence.
      
    6. Recapture of Property
      A person may commit an act which would otherwise be tortious if he or she is acting in fresh pursuit and with a reasonable degree of force to regain possession of his or her property. 
      
      There are three separate aspects to this particular defense:
    
      a. Re-entry Upon Land
      b. Recapture of Chattel
      c. Shopkeeper's Rule
      
    7. Legal Authority
      A person may commit an otherwise tortious act if it is done under legal process or is otherwise authorized by law. 
      
      It is a defence that is usually used by police officers or private persons who have made an arrest either with or without a warrant and who are now facing charges of false imprisonment in relation to their having made the arrest.
      
    8. Necessity
      A person may commit an otherwise tortious act if that person is acting in an emergency situation to protect himself or others from a threatened injurty to a person or property. The person claiming the defense of necessity may act on appearances. A reasonable mistake is permitted.
      
      a. Public Necessity
      b. Private Necessity
      
2. Negligence
    Liability for negligence requires proof of:
      a. a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff,
      b. a breach of that duty, and
      c. that the breach was the actual and proximate cause of
      d. damages suffered by the plaintiff.


  A. Duty
    1. General
      The general rule of duty holds that everyone owes a duty to exercise due care so as not to subject others to unreasonable risks of harm.
      
      a. Cardoza Rule on Duty
        Under Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co., Justice Cardozo's majority opinion held that a defendant owes a duty only to those who could foreseeably be endangered by the defendant's negligent act. There according to the rule, there is no duty owed to a plaintiff who is in a position of apparent safety when the defendant commits a negligent act. This is the so-called "orbit of danger" test.
        
      b. Andrews Rule on Duty
        In the Palsgraf case, Justice Andrews gave a dissenting opinion which has been applied as the majority opinion in other cases. Andrews argued that if the defendant owes a duty to anyone, then he owes a duty to everyone who could foreseeably be injured by his action. Thus, Cardozo looked at the issue from a perspective of identifying whether a duty is owed, while Andrews considered the issue as one of proximate causation.
      
    2. Special
      In addition to the general duty which everyone owes, special duties may be imposed due to a special relationship or circumstance.
    
      a. Negligence Per Se
        Under the doctrine of negligence per se, the elements of duty and breach are proven when
        i. a defendant violates a safety statute
        ii. which was intended to protect the class of people to which the plaintiff belongs
        iii. from the kind of injury the defendant caused.
        
        In california, a presumption of negligence arises.
      
      b. Cars / Autos (Drivers of Vehicles)
        Duty Owned to a Guest Passenger
          A driver of a motor vehicle, in the absence of a statute otherwise, owes to persons riding in the vehicle a duty of driving with due care. 
          
          However, a number of jurisdictions have statutes that provide that a guest passenger in an automobile cannot recover from the owner or operator of the automobile unless the owner or operator is guilty of willful misconduct, recklessness, or intoxication.
          
        Duty Owned to a Person Injured by a Drunk Driver
          A person who serves alcoholic beverages to one who is intoxicated is not, in the absence of a statute stating otherwise, liable for the damages done by the intoxicated person. 
          
          However, in those jurisdictions which have statutes traditionally referred to as dram shop acts, an owner, a bartender or other persons serving alcoholic beverages to a person who is intoxicated can be held liable for the foreseeable damages caused by the intoxicated person.
          
        Owner Liability Statutes
          Certain statutes impose liability upon owners of vehicles for the tortious acts committed by persons to whom the owner intentionally furnishes the vehicle.
        
        Family Purpose Doctrine
          A parent who furnishes a vehicle to the members of his or her family for customary convenience, assumes liability for the tortious acts committed by those persons when the car is being driven for a family purpose.
          
      c. Omission to Act (omission is non feasance, i.e. i did not did anything then how am i liable)
        An omission to act to prevent injury, or "nonfeasance" as it is sometimes called, does not give rise to tort liability unless there is a special relationship or special circumstance which creates an affirmative duty requiring the defendant to act to protect the plaintiff.
        
        An affirmative duty to act may arise when there is a close familial relationship, such as 
          parent and child or husband and wife; 
          when the defendant and the plaintiff are co-ventures; 
          when the defendant caused the plaintiff to be in danger or injured; 
          when the defendant has begun to render assistance to the plaintiff; 
          when the defendant fails to perform a duty to control the behavior of others; 
          when the defendant is an innkeeper; or 
          when the defendant operates a common carrier such as a plane or ship.
        
        
      d. Rescuers / Good Samaritans
        i. Duty owed by a good samaritan
          A person who embarks upon the performance of services for another, whether gratuitously or for consideration, is under a duty to render those services with due care.

          This person, however is under no duty to complete the performance of the services unless abondonment would prejudice the other party's position. The rendering of aid in an emergency constitutes the performance of services, and a duty of care is imposed upon those who undertake to render such aid.

          Some jurisdictions have enacted statutes designed to encourage physicians to render emergency aid, by limiting the liability that could otherwise be imposed upon them. Generally speaking, liability can be imposed upon them only for reckless or wanton misconduct.
          
        ii.Duty Owed to a Rescuer
          A person whose negligence creates a situation in which he needs to be rescued may be held liable for injuries incurred by his rescuer.
      
      e. Negligent Supervision /Parents
        i. Child tortfeasors
          Held to duty of reasonable person of child's age and maturity - watch for adult activities.
          
        ii. Negligent Supervision
          Negligent supervision is a cause of action which is brought by a plaintiff who suffered injury because a child or other person was inadequately supervised by one who owed a duty of supervision. Most commonly, it is brought against parents who failed to exercise ordinary parental discretion as to the manner in which their child is supervised or cared for.
          
          Modernly, a child may bring an action against his or her own parents for injuries sustained by the child because of lack of proper supervision.
      
      f. Professionals
        A professional owes a duty of higher care than a layman. A professional owes a duty to act as a reasonable professional in the field.
        
      g. Land Occupier
        i. Invitees, Licensees, Passersby, and Trespassers
          1. Duty Owed to an Invitee
            Invitee: An invitee is a person who has an express or implied invitation to enter property for the purpose for which the propert is maintained.
            
            Business Invitee: A business invitee is a person who has express or implied permission to enter business property to do business with the land occupier.
            
            Public Invitee: A public invitee enters property in the possession of another for the purpose for which the property is held open to the public. It is not required that a business purpose be involved. Public employees acting within the scope of their official duties are included in the category of public invitees.
            
            
            Rule:
            A land occupier owes a duty of ordinary care to invitees, which includes reasonably inspecting the land for dangerous conditions and repairing those dangerous conditions which a reasonable inspection would reveal.
            
            Idea:
            Inspect and Correct
            
          2. Dutoy Owed to a Licensee
            Licensee: A licensee is a person who enter sproperty with the express or implied permission of land occupier. Such entry is not for the purpose of oding business.
            
            E.g. if i invite my friend to come to my home for dinner, they are licensee.
            
            Rule:
            A landowner owes a duty of ordinary care to licensees, which includes either:
              i. warning licensees of known dangerous conditions, unless they are obvious or already known to the licensee, or 
              ii. repairing dangerous conditions to make the property safe.
              
          3. Duty Owed to a Trespasser
            Trespasser: A trespasser is a person who enters the real property of another without express or implied consent.
          
            Rule:
            The land occupier generally owes no duty of care to the trespasser unless
              a. the trespasser is a constant trespasser upon a limited area or 
              b. threspasser is a child to whom the Attractive Nuisance Doctrine applies.
          
          
            Duty owed to a Constant Trespasser Upon a Limited Area
              What is Constant Trespasser Upon a Limited Area?
                A constant trespasser upon a limited area is a trespasser whose presence is known or should be known, to land occupier because of the trespasser's repeated acts of trespassing.
                
              Rule:
                The land occupier owes a duty to a constant trespasser upon a limited area of warning him of known dangerous artificial conditions unless such conditions are obvious.
                
                "Warn of artificial conditions unless obvious"
            
            Duty Owed to a Child Trespasser
              The land occupier owes no duty to a child trespasser unless he is a constant trespasser upon a limited area or unless the case is one in which the Attractive Nuisance Doctrine applies.
              
            Attractive Nuisance Doctrine
              The land occupier owes a duty of reasonable care to eliminate a danger or to otherwise protect children when the following elements are present:
                a. foreseeability of trespass,
                b. foreseeability of serious harm,
                c. the child is unaware of the danger and 
                d. the benefit to the owner of maintaining the condition in its dangerous form is slight when weighed against the risk to children.
                
              Element 1:
                Foreseeable Trespass
              
              Element 2:
                Foreseeable serious harm
              
              Element 3:
                Child not aware of danger
              
              Element 4:
                Balance of benefit to risk
                
              Analysis:
                Here, there were many children and hardly any fences in the neighborhood so it seems reasonable to expect that the children might enter nearby neighbors' back yards; thus trespass by children is foreseeable.
                
                Also, since Owen removed a tree which left a deep hole in his back yard, it is foreseeable that a child could fall into the hole and be seriously hurt.
                
                Additionally, 8 year old Carl lived right next door to Owen was unware of the deep hole and fell in the hole, breaking his leg.
                
                Finally, the cost to Owen to voer the hole or at least place markers around it was very little compared to the harm Carl suffered by breaking his leg.
              
              Conclusion
                Element 1:
                  Foreseeable Trespass: Lot of Kids

                Element 2:
                  Foreseeable serious harm: Deep Hole

                Element 3:
                  Child not aware of danger: Carl falls in

                Element 4:
                  Balance of benefit to risk: Cover the Hole Vs Leg
            Duty Owed to a Person Off the Premises
              The land occupier owes a duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition for the protection of passersby and occupiers of adjoining premises. This includes the duty of inspection to discover and correct theose defects which a reasonable inspection would reveal.
              
              INSPECT AND CORRECT
            
        ii. Attractive Nuisance Doctrine
          Explained above
          
        iii. Rowland v. Christian
          Under Rowland v. Christian, the court eliminated the distinction between business invitee, licensee, and trespasser, and found that the land occupier owes a duty to act as a "reasonable man" for the purposes of rendering the occupied property safe for others.
        
        Natural Conditions:
          A land occupier traditionally owed no duty to others for the care of natural conditions on the occupied property. However, the recent trend may be to impose a duty of reasonable care as to natural conditions, at least in those situations where the condition is known to the landowner.
          
          
      h. Lesses & Lessors
      
        Lessors - LandLoard
        Lessees - Tenant
      
        A lessee is a land occupier and has the same liabilities that any land occupier whould have. A landlord owes no duty to a person coming onto land with the consent of the lesse, with the following exceptions:
        
        1. the lessor owes a duty if a danger exists at the start of the lease which the lessor knows or should know about and which the lessee has no reason to know about.
        2. the lessor has the duty to inspect for and repair dangerous conditions, if the lessor knows the lessee will hold the land and open to the public.
        3. the lessor has a duty to use reasonable care to make common areas safe.
        4. the lessor owes a duty to keep the premises in good repair if that is part of the lesse contract.
        5. the lessor owes a duty if he begins repairs and performs them unreasonablyor does not finish them.
        6. the lessor owes a general duty of care in some jurisdictions.
      
  B. Breach
    A breach is the failure to perform one's duty.
    
    1. Direct / Circumtantial
      Breach is proved by direct or circumstantial evidence.
      
    2. Res Ipsa Loquitur
      ResIpsa Loquitur is a rule of evidence which aids the plaintiff in proving the element of breach of duty when the plaintiff is unable to establish by other evidence that the defendant acted unreasonably. The doctrine proceeds upon the theory that the occurence itself speaks of negligence and it is unnecessary for the plaintiff to show the exact circumstances whereby the defendant breached his or her duty of care.
      
      The literal interpretation is "the thing speak for itself"
      
      Rule for Memorization
        Under the doctrine of ResIpsa Loquitor, the defendants duty and breach are established if the plaintiff proves:
        
        a. the defendant was in complete control of the instrument that caused the harm;
        b. the plaintiff is not guilty of contributory negligence;
        c. the defendant is in a better position to explain what happened; and
        d. injuries of this type do not normally occur absent such negligence.
        
  C. Causation
    Proof that the defendant's act is the actual and proximate cause of the plaintiff's harm is required in order to establish that a defendant should be held liable for that particular harm.
    
    Actual cause and Proximate cause are TWO separate issues, each of which must be SEPARATELY proved. That means TWO IRAC section.
    
    1. Actual (Factual Cause, Cause in Fact)
      An actual cause is the cause which starts, ignites or makes possible the result which follows, and which satisfies the "But For" or Substantial Factor Test.
      
      a. But for
        The "But For" Test is used to establish actual cause. To apply the test, the plaintiff must show that "but for" the defendant's act, the plaintiff would not have been injured.
        
        Applying the "But For" Test to Multiple Acts
          The "But For" Test may be applied where concurrentacts together produce an injury which would not have occurred but for the concurrence. Where the concurrent acts are performed by different persons, both persons are liable as concurrent tortfeasers.
          
          
      b. Substantial Factor
        Under the "Substantial Factor Test", the defendant's breach of duty is an actual cause of the plaintiff's harm if the defendant's act is a substantial factor in bringing the harm about. This means that the defendant's act contributed in more than a trivial degree to the plaintiff's injury.
        
        The test applies where tow or more acts combine to produce a single indivisiable injury regardless of whether either or any of the acts by itself would have caused the injury.
        
        Where more than one act could have caused the injury by itself, then each actor may be held jointly and severally liable. However, where an act would not have caused the injury without the other contributing acts, liability may be apportioned between the tortfeasors.
        
    2. Proximate
      An actual cause of harm is the proximate cause of that harm if the act occurs in a natural and continuous sequence of events, unbroken by unforeseeable, independent, intervening acts, and results in the harm.
      
      Rule:
        Proximate cause is an act which, in a natural and continuous sequence of events, unbroken by unforeseeable, independent, intervening acts, causes injury to the plaintiff, without which the injury would not have occurred.
        
      Proximate cause is
        i. an act which
          a. in a natural and continuous sequence of events,
          b. unbroken by
            I. unforeseeable,
            II. independent,
            III. intervening acts
          c. causes injury to the plaintiff
        ii. without which the injury whould not have occured.
        
      Proximate cause means either that
        i. the defendant's act directly caused injury to the plaintiff without any intervening acts or
        ii. if there was an intervening act,
          a. it was a dependent act with a foreseeable cause or
          b. it was an independent act with a highly foreeable result.
      
      Note that for a direct cause, there can be an exception if the cause is so remote to the damages that is unfair to impose liability.
      
      Dependent intervening act with foreseeable cause
        Dependent means the intervening act would not have occured without the original act. Foreseeable cause means that the depndent intervening act was foreseeable when viewed in the light of the original act.
      
      Independent intervening act with highly foreseeable result
        Independnt means the intervening act would have occured even without the original act. Highly foreseeable result means that even though the independent intervening act would have happened anyhow, the result was highly foreseeable.
        
      Cases:
        1. D x , Defendant did act x and it causes injury to Plaintiff
        2. D x 1 2 3 P, Defendant did act x and it is followed by acts 1, 2, 3 and that causes injury to Plaintiff
        
        i. D:
          a. Act X
            Act which breaches duty and which sets in motion a serios of continuous events.
          b. Intervening Acts: (1, 2, 3)
            Look here for intervening acts. What events happened after the breach and before the damages?
        ii. P
          Harm / Damage: Plaintiff's harm or damages occur
      
      Do sampleTest1.html,
      Do sampleTest2.html
      
      a. Watch the time line
      b. Direct
      c. Intervening Acts
        i. Independent
          
          Independent intervening act with highly foreseeable result
            Independnt means the intervening act would have occured even without the original act. Highly foreseeable result means that even though the independent intervening act would have happened anyhow, the result was highly foreseeable.
            
        ii. Dependent
          
          Dependent intervening act with foreseeable cause
            Dependent means the intervening act would not have occured without the original act. Foreseeable cause means that the depndent intervening act was foreseeable when viewed in the light of the original act.
          
  D. Damages
    
    1. Physical Harm Needed
      In a negligence action, 

      the plaintiff may not recover damages unless he first proves that he suffered physical harm. 

      Once this is established, he may recover most categories of damages, except for punitive damages, which are generally not available for negligence, unless the defendant's conduct was reckless or outrageous.
    2. NIED
    
      A plaintiff may recover damages for negligent infliction of emotional distress if:
        i. there was a physical impact to the plaintiff's person, or
        ii. the plaintiff physically manifests emotional distress caused by either
          a. the defendant's endangerment of the plaintiff who was within the zone of danger or
          b. by the defendant's injuring of the plaintiff's close relative while the plaintiff was present and aware of the injury happening.
          
    NO PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN NEGLIGENCE
    
  E. Defenses
    1. Contributory Negligence
      Under the minority doctrine of contributory negligence, if the plaintiff's failure to exercise reasonable care for his own safety is a contributing factor to his own injury, he is barred from recovery for the defendant's negligent action.
      
    2. Comparative Negligence
      
      Modernly, the doctrine of comparative negligence has replaced contributory negligence, so that liability is apportioned according to the relative degrees of fault of the plaintiff and defendant.
    
      In pure comparative negligence jurisdiction like California, the plaintiff will recover some damages no matter how great his own negligence was.
      
      In partical comparative negligence jurisdictions, the plaintiff will not recover if his own negligence equals or exceeds the defendant's.
      
    3. Last Clear Chance
      The last clear change doctrine limits the contributory negligence defense,
      
      so that even if the plaintiff was contributorily negligent,
      
      he will be permitted to recover if the defendant hasd a superior opportunity to avoid the accident and failed to do so.
    
    4. Assumption of Risk
      Under the defense of assumption of a risk, a plaintiff assumes the risk of harm if he voluntarily subjects himself to a known and appreciated risk. Such consent may be expressly created by agreement between the parties, or it may be implied by the plaintiff's conduct. At common law, assumption of the risk is a complete bar to recover in a negligence action.
    
  F. Multiple Defendant Issues
    1. Joint, Concurrent, Successive
      a. Joint Tortfeasors
        Joint tortfeasors consist of two or more persons who join together to commit a tortious act.
        
        Their status is similar to that of co-cospirtators in criminal law, and each is vicariously liable for the acts done by the other in the furtherance of the common design.
        
      b. Concurrent Tortfeasors
        Concurrent tortfeasors consist of two or more persons who are not acting in concert with each other but whose acts combine to produce a single indivisible injury to the plaintiff.
        
      In some jurisdictions, joint and several liability is applied in a pure form, holding each concurrent torteasor liable for the full amount of the harm.
      
      However, a majority of jurisdictions will apportion damages by using a comparative fault system.
      
      Vicarious liability does not apply.
    
    2. Joint & Several Liability
    3. Contribution & Indemnity

3. Miscellaneous Torts Concepts
  A. Wrongful Death
  B. Survival Statutes
  C. Statute of Limitations
  D. Immunities
    1. Husband / Wife
      At common law, husband-wife immunity prevented one spouse from maintaining an action against the other.
      
      Modernly, husband-wife immunity does not exist in most jurisdictions.
  
    2. Parent / Child
      Traditionally parent-child immunity has been applied so that parent and minor child are immune from suits against each other in tort action.
	
      However, suits involving interference with property interests have been freely allowed.

      Many jurisdictions have abolished parent-child immunity.

    3. Charities
      Charitable immunity traditionally prevented non-paying recipients from suing a charity.

      However, paying recipients could sue the charity because, as to them, it was not a charity; it was business.

      Modernly, the trend is to abolish the immunity and to hold non-profit organizations liable to the same extent as any other wrongdoing defendant.
    
    4. Government
    
      Governmental immunity has been applied to prevent suits against a governmental entity unless that entity has consented to the suit.

      A substantial number of jurisdictions have totally abolished the immunity of municipal governments, and in several states, the immunity of the state government has also been terminated.

4. Strict Liability
  Strict liability is liability without fault.

  It is imposed against a defendant even though the defendent has done nothing intentionally wrong and has not acted unreasonably under the circumstances.

  A. Animals
    Strict liability is typically imposed for the keeping of dangerous animals.

    i. Watch for dangerous characteristic.
    ii. Domestic animals with known dangerous propensity.
    
    Dangerous animals? anything which is not domestic is dangerous:
      Lions, monkey, zebra, alligator, reptiles, 
    
    Domestic animals are:
      Cow, sheep, dog, cat, bull (domestic but dangerous)
    
    
    
  B. Abnormally Dangerous Activities
    Strict liability is typically imposed for the carrying on of abnormally dangerous activities.

    i. Non-delegation issue
    
  C. Non-natural Additions to Land
    Rylands v. Fletcher
      Under the landmark English case of Rylands v. Fletcher, one who brings something onto his land which is non-natural and likely to cause injury if it escapes, is strictly liable for all damages resulting from an escape.
      
  D. Defenses
    Generally, there are none, as strict liability means liability without fault and is strictly enforced.

    However, in some jurisdictions, the following may apply in certain situations.
    
    i. Contributory Negligence
        Contributory negligence is not a defense for strict liability torts unless the plaintiff has knowingly assumed an unreasonable risk.

        Example:
        Taunting a wild animal by poking it with a stick (but watch for attractive nuisance)
    
    ii. Comparative Negligence
	     Some jurisdictions allow comparative fault to diminish recovery where the plaintiff is partially at fault for the harm.
    
    iii. Assumption of Risk
	    A limited defense based upon consent may apply as a type of assumption of the risk.

      Example:
      Lion tamer can’t recover from circus for lion bite injury.

5. Vicarious Liability
  Under the theory of vicarious liability, a defendant who is not charged with personal fault or wrongdoing may be held liable for the tortfeasor’s act because of the defendant’s relationship to the tortfeasor.

  A defendant who is held vicariously liable has the right to indemnification by the tortfeasor.
  
  
  A. Employment Relationship - Respondeat Superior

    - Let the superior answer -
    The doctrine of respondeat superior applies in employment situations to hold the employer vicariously liable for his employee’s torts which are committed within the scope of employment.
  
    1. Scope of empolyment
	     A tort is committed within the scope of employment wihen the employee was acting with an intent to further his employer’s business interests, even if the employee acted indirectly or unwisely, and even if the employer forbade the employee from such an act.
       
    2. To / From Home
      Typically, the trip from home to work, or from work to home, is not considered part of the scope of employment.

      Exception: an employee who is "on the clock” during such trips.
      
    3. Frolic and Detour
      a. A frolic is an employee’s significant deviation from the employer’s business for personal reasons.

        A frolic is outside the scope of employment, so the employer will not be vicariously liable.
        
      b. b. A detour is an employee’s minor deviation from the employer’s business for personal reasons.

        A detour is within the scope of employment, so the employer will be vicariously liable.
