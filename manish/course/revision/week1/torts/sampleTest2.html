<p>Sample Tort Test</p>
<p>Dan was driving down the road when a squirrel ran in front of his car. He swerved to avoid hitting the squirrel, and he ran into a tree. </p>
<p>The tree trunk broke and fell across the road. Sally was driving in the opposite direction when she saw the tree fall. To avoid having the tree hit her, Sally swerved onto Pete’s lawn, narrowly escaping injury from the falling tree.</p>
<p>Sally’s car caused significant damage to Pete’s yard, crushing several sprinkler lines and destroying several very valuable plants.</p>
<p>Pete has filed a lawsuit against Dan. Discuss.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Call of Question:</strong></p>
<p>Pete has filed a lawsuit against Dan. Discuss.</p>
<p>Understanding Paragraph:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Dan </strong>was <u>driving down</u> the road when a squirrel ran in front of his car.</p>
<p>Driving down: General Duty</p>
<p>2. He <u>swerved</u> to avoid hitting the squirrel, and <u>he ran into a tree</u>. </p>
<p>Swerved: Relates to Duty</p>
<p>3. The tree trunk <u>broke and fell</u> across the road. </p>
<p>Broke and Fell: Intervening Act 1</p>
<p>4. <strong>Sally</strong> was <u>driving</u> in the opposite direction when she saw the tree fall. </p>
<p>driving: Not an intervening act, because she started driving before real thing happen</p>
<p>5. Sally <u>swerved</u> onto <strong>Pete’s</strong> lawn, narrowly escaping injury from the falling tree.</p>
<p>swerved: Intervening Act 2</p>
<p>6. <u>Sally’s car caused</u> significant <u>damage to Pete’s yard</u>, crushing several sprinkler lines and destroying several very valuable plants.</p>
<p>Sally car: Causation by Dan</p>
<p>damage to Pete's Yard: Damages</p>

<p><strong>Essay:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pete v. Dan</strong></p>
<p><strong>Did Dan owe a duty to Pete?</strong></p>
<p>The general rule of duty holds that everyone owes a duty of exercise due care so as not to subject others to unreasonable risks of harm.</p>
<p>Here, as a driver, Dan owes a duty to drive with reasonable care so that he dose not risk harming others on or near the road.</p>
<p>Dan may argue he only owes a duty to those actually using the road and no facts show Pete was on the road. However, under the Cardoza rule of duty from the Palsgraf case, since Pete’s lawn appears to be near enough to the road for Sally to run onto it when she swerved, Pete is likely within the orbit of danger surrounding Dan. Under Andrew’s view, if Dan’s action caused injury to Pete, then Dan will be liable.</p>
<p>So under both views, Dan owes a duty to Pete.</p>
<p><strong>Did Dan Breach his Duty to Pete?</strong></p>
<p>A breach is a failure to perform one’s duty</p>
<p>Here, it wasn’t a breach for Dan to swerve and avoid hitting the squirrel as long as he could do so safely without causing harm to anyone else. However, when Dan swerved, he hit a tree, which ultimately led to harming Pete’s lawn (infra).</p>
<p>Therefore, Dan breached his duty to Pete.</p>
<p><strong>Was Dan’s Breach the Actual Cause of Pete’s Harm?</strong></p>
<p>An actual cause is the cause which starts, ignites or makes possible the result which follows, and which satisfies the “But For” Test.</p>
<p>Dan’s act of hitting the tree started a series events that led to damage to Pete’s yard. But for Dan swerving and hitting the tree, the damage would not have occured.</p>
<p>Thus, Dan’s breach of duty is the actual cause of Pete’s harm.</p>
<p><strong>Was Dan’s Breach the Proximate Cause of Pete’s Harm?</strong></p>
<p>An actual cause of harm is the proximate cause of that harm if the act occurs in a natural and continuous sequence of events, unbroken by unforeseeable, independent, intervening acts, and results in the harm.</p>
<p>As stated already, when Dan swerved and hit the tree, it set in motion a series of events that led to the damage to Pete’s yard. There were two intervening acts, each which will be discussed below.</p>
<p>First, it was an intervening act when the tree broke and fell because this occurred after Dan’s breach and before the damage to Pete’s yard. However, this is a dependent intervening act since it would not have happened without Dan’s initial breach. Additionally, if someone crashes into a tree, it is foreseeable that the tree could fall because the crash would jar it. Thus, this intervening act does not break the chain of causation set in motion by Dan swerving and hitting the tree.</p>
<p>The second intervening act occurred when Sally swerved onto Pete’s lawn to avoid hitting the tree. This was also a dependent intervening act because Sally would not have swerved if the tree had not fallen onto the road, as evidenced by the fact that Sally saw the tree fall and narrowly escaped injury herself by swerving onto Pete’s lawn. Finally, it is foreseeable that other drivers like Sally might be using the road at the same time as Dan, and if a tree falls into the road, it would be natural and foreseeable for them to swerve to avoid being hit by the tree. So this intervening act also does not break the chain of causation.</p>
<p>Therefore, Dan’s breach of duty is the proximate cause of Pete’s harm.</p>
<p><strong>Did Pete suffer damage?</strong></p>
<p>Special damages are those which flow naturally from the act.</p>
<p>The damage that Pete incurred his sprinkler system and valuable plants flow naturally from Sally’s swerving onto his lawn because a car is heavy and would foreseeably cause damage when driven on a lawn.</p>
<p>Therefore, there were damages.</p>
