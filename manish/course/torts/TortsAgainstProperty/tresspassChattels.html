      <td><p class="bodytext">Trespass to Chattels is defined as committing any 

          act of direct physical interference with a chattel possessed by another 

          without lawful justification. <br>

          <br>

          To make a case for Trespass to Chattels, the plaintiff must show that 

          the defendant made a volitional movement that resulted in either :<br>

          <br>

          (1) Dispossession of , or <br>

          (2) Intermeddling with,<br>

          <br>

          the plaintiff&#8217;s personal property.<br>

          <br>

          Dispossession is where the defendant actually asserts ownership over 

          the chattel. <br>

          <br>

          Intermeddling is merely interfering with the plaintiff's use of his 

          chattel.<br>

          <br>

          The plaintiff must show that the defendant intended to treat the property 

          in the manner that he did.<br>

          <br>

          As in Trespass to Land, it makes no difference that the defendant might 

          have mistaken the plaintiff&#8217;s property for his own. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"> Herman sees his copy of &#8220;War and Peace&#8221; 

          sitting on a table. He picks up the book, puts it in his bag and goes 

          home. In fact, the book belongs to Leon and Herman has mistaken it for 

          his own copy. In this case, Herman is liable for a trespass to chattels 

          because he intended to take Leon&#8217;s book, even though his action 

          was based on a reasonable mistake.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">In order to bring suit, the plaintiff must be in actual 

          possession of, or have the right of immediate possession to, the chattel. 

          <br>

          <br>

          Further, the dispossession or intermeddling must have been caused by 

          the defendant&#8217;s volitional act in order for the trespass to be 

          actionable. <br>

          <br>

          Unlike trespass to land, there needs to be actual damages incurred by 

          the plaintiff in order for him to sue. However, this only applies to 

          intermeddling. In the case of dispossession, the plaintiff can sue even 

          if he did not incur any actual damages. For example:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor">(1) Hugh takes Larry's magazine with the intent 

          of reading it and then returning it. Hugh returns the magazine to Larry 

          in the same condition it was in when he borrowed it. Since this is intermeddling 

          and there are no actual damages, Hugh is not liable.<br>

          <br>

          (2) Hugh steals the magazine but Larry, having already read it, has 

          no more use for it. This is dispossession and Hugh is liable even though 

          there are no actual damages. </p>

        <p><span class="bodytext">Closely related to the concept of Trespass to 

          Chattels is the concept of conversion. The same elements that apply 

          to Trespass to Chattels apply to conversion. However, there are two 

          important differences. First, a conversion suit is usually brought in 

          cases where the damage done to Plaintiff&#8217;s possession is more 

          severe that in a trespass case. See Zaslow 

          v. Kroenert 29 Cal.2d 541 (1946). Second, a verdict for the plaintiff 

          in a conversion suit is effectively a forced sale of the damaged chattel 

          to the defendant.<br>

          <br>

          A conversion suit can occur for either dispossession or intermeddling, 

          however, once again, conversion suits are brought in cases where the 

          damage done to the property is more severe than in a trespass case. 

          (Please note that what &quot;more severe means is usually determined 

          on a case by case basis.) For example</span>:</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"> (1) Daphne hits Marty&#8217;s dog Eddie with 

          her car. Eddie suffers a broken leg. This would be an actionable trespass 

          to chattels and Marty would be awarded damages commensurate with the 

          harm done by Daphne.<br>

          <br>

          (2). Daphne hits Marty&#8217;s dog Eddie with her car. Eddie dies. This 

          would be an actionable conversion (note the increased severity of the 

          damage done to Eddie). Marty would be awarded Eddie&#8217;s full value 

          but Daphne would now own Eddie&#8217;s body.</p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"><span class="bodytext">In some cases, conversion 

          actions can be sustained even if there is no damage to the object, when 

          a party is entrusted with property and fails to return it in a timely 

          manner. See Russell-Vaughn 

          Ford v. Rouse 206 So.2d 371 (Ala. 1968).<br>

          <br>

          Thus, a conversion suit can be brought when a bailee (a party who receives 

          temporary possession of chattel but not ownership) misuses property 

          entrusted to him. For example:</span></p>

        <p class="bodytextColor"> Larry borrows Kevin&#8217;s car to go fishing. 

          Larry decides to take the car on an overnight camping trip instead. 

          While Larry is in the woods, a tree falls on the car and seriously damages 

          it. Larry will be liable for a conversion. As a borrower of Kevin&#8217;s 

          car, Larry is a bailee. Larry had permission to use Kevin&#8217;s car 

          but he did not have permission to take the car on an overnight camping 

          trip. By exceeding the authority he had to use the car, Larry becomes 

          liable for the damage to the car, even though it was not Larry&#8217;s 

          fault that the car got damaged</p>

        <p class="bodytext">In addition, buying or selling stolen goods, even 

          where the defendant acted in good faith and has no idea that the goods 

          are stolen, represents an actionable conversion. <br>

          <br>

          Finally, misdelivering a chattel, even in good faith, will result in 

          an actionable conversion.<br>

          As previously mentioned, a successful action for conversion will result 

          in the forced sale of the chattel to the defendant. In this situation, 

          the defendant receives the damaged property and the plaintiff receives 

          the market value of his property at the time the conversion was committed.<br>

          <br>

          If, however, the property has a fluctuating value, the plaintiff will 

          recover the highest value the property attained during the time between 

          the conversion and the verdict. <br>

          Additionally, in a case of dispossession, the Plaintiff can sue not 

          only for the return of his property, but also for &quot;loss of use&quot; 

          of his chattel. <br>
