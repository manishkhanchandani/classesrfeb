<h3>Contracts</h3>

<p>A contract offer is a <strong>manifestation of present contractual intent</strong> by the "offeror" <strong>communicated to the "offeree"</strong> with sufficient <strong>certainty of terms</strong> that an objective observer would reasonably believe assent would form a bargain.</p>
<p><strong>UNILATERAL offers</strong></p>
<p>A unilateral contract offer is one that unequivocally and unambiguously demands or requires that<strong> it can only be accepted by the offeree performing a requested act </strong>rather than by promising to act in exchange.</p>
<p>For example: Bob tells Tom, &quot;I will give you $20 if and only if you go into the girl's gym, flap your arms like a chicken and say &quot;cluck, cluck&quot;.&quot; Since Tom clearly must go into the girl's gym and act like a chicken to accept the offer, it is a unilateral contract offer.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL offers </strong></p>
<p>General offers are offers made to the public at large, offering to pay a <strong>reward or bounty</strong> to anyone who performs a requested act. By implication <strong>these are always unilateral contract offers.</strong></p>
<p>For example: Mary posts a notice that says, &quot;$100 REWARD. I have lost my lamb. $100 reward for its safe return.&quot; This is a general offer because it promises an award to any person who returns the lamb. It is also a unilateral contract offer because it demands performance, not just some &quot;promise&quot; to look for the sheep.</p>
