If you do not have a book that presents this material you should get one (You should have gotten one at the beginning of your contracts class!). But if you refuse to get one, or can't get one quickly, use this on-line resource –<br>
  http://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/<br>
<br>
At this time the California Bar says that it also tests students on "all of Article 1" but there isn't much in that Article that is any different from common law rules.<br>
<br>
The California Bar requirements are subject to change, and are currently posted at this website where you might be wise to review them –<br>
