CONTRACTS LAW

The rights and remedies of the parties depend on whether or not there was a valid contract. A contract is a promise or set of promises the performance of which the law will recognize as a duty and for which the law will provide a remedy.



1. Does UCC apply?

UCC Article 2 governs contracts for the sale of GOODS, movable things at the time of
identification to the contract. Otherwise, only COMMON LAW governs the contract.

Sample 1, page 74.

Here the contract does not concern a sale of movable things because it is for the "rent" of a "house".

Therefore, only COMMON LAW principles govern this contract.

2. Are the parties MERCHANTS?

3. Was the communication of [date] an OFFER?

4. Was the offer a MERCHANT’S FIRM OFFER?

5. Was it an offer for a UNILATERAL CONTRACT?

6. Was the communication (action) of [date] an (implied) ACCEPTANCE?

7. Did the VARYING TERMS become part of the contract?

8. Had the OFFER LAPSED before acceptance was attempted?

9. Was the communication of [date] an EFFECTIVE ACCEPTANCE?

10. Was the communication of [date] an EFFECTIVE REJECTION?

11. Was the communication of [date] an EFFECTIVE REVOCATION?
Under the MAILBOX RULES revocation of a contract offer is usually effective upon receipt.

Under common law a unilateral offer could be revoked at any time, and revocation of GENERAL OFFERS, reward or bounty offers, was effective when published in the same manner the offer was first announced. But modernly SAVING DOCTRINES prevent the revocation of a unilateral contract offer if the offeror is aware the offeree has commenced the requested act for a reasonable period during which the offeree will be allowed to complete acceptance by performance.


12. Was there an IMPLIED-IN-FACT CONTRACT?
Under contract law an IMPLIED-IN-FACT CONTRACT will be deemed to have existed, even if there is no express agreement between the parties, if one party acts to bestow benefits on the other party reasonably expecting to be compensated, and the other party knowingly accepts those benefits knowing that the other party expects to be compensated.

13. Is a WRITING needed?

If ONLY common law governs say, 
Under the STATUTE OF FRAUDS certain types of contracts must be written in order to be legally enforced, and one type is a contract for (pick one if it applies here -- MARRIAGE, more than a YEAR, LAND, EXECUTOR of an estate, GUARANTEE of a debt).


If UCC say,

Under UCC 2-201, a contract for sale of goods worth $500 or more must evidenced by a writing sufficient to show the existence of a contract and signed by the party against whom the contract is to be enforced. But between merchants a SALES CONFIRMATION by one listing quantity will bind both parties if the receiving party does not object within 10 days.

Furthermore, the UCC provides exceptions for SPECIAL MADE GOODS, where there is an ADMISSION by the party to be bound that there had been an agreement, or where there has been PARTIAL PERFORMANCE of the contract (i.e. acceptance of some or all goods or payment).

Under UCC 2-209 contract modifications must be written to be legally enforceable if the contract, as modified, is for over $500. Otherwise modification agreements will be treated as waivers of conditions that can be always be retracted, unless the Court estops retraction to prevent injustice.
