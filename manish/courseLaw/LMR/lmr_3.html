<h1>Contracts</h1>
<p>The rights and remedies of the parties depend on whether or not there was a valid contract. A contract is a promise or set of promises the performance of which the law will recognize as a duty and for which the law will provide a remedy.</p>
<p><strong>A. Formation of Contract</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Does UCC apply?</strong><br>
    UCC Article 2 governs <strong>contracts</strong> for the sale of <strong>GOODS</strong>, <strong>movable</strong> things at the time of <strong>identitfication</strong> to the contract. Otherwise, only <strong>COMMON LAW</strong> governs the contract. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Are the parties MERCHANTS?</strong><br>
    Under the UCC MERCHANTS are the people who <strong>deal</strong> in the goods or hold themselves out by <strong>occupation</strong> or <strong>knowledgeable</strong> about the goods in a contract. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Was the communication of [date] an OFFER?</strong><br>
  Under contract law an OFFER is a <strong>manifestation</strong> of present contractual <strong>intent</strong> <strong>communicated</strong> to the offeree such that an objective person would <strong>reasonably believe</strong> assent would form a bargain.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>At common law</strong>, a communication was only deemed sufficient to constitute an offer if it specifies the <strong>parties</strong>, <strong>subject</strong> matter, <strong>quantity</strong>, <strong>price</strong>, and <strong>time</strong> of performance.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>The UCC</strong> deems a communication sufficient to constitute an offer if it specifies the <strong>parties</strong> and <strong>quantity</strong>. The UCC provides &quot;GAP FILLERS&quot; that may be used by the Court to determine the additional terms.<br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Was the offer a MERCHANT’S FIRM OFFER?</strong><br>
    Under UCC 2-205 an offer by a <strong>merchant</strong> that promises to &quot;leave the offer open&quot; for a period of time cannot be revoked by the offeror if it is stated in <strong>writing</strong>, for the <strong>period of time stated</strong>, or for a <strong>reasonable period of time</strong> if no time period is stated.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Was it an offer for a UNILATERAL CONTRACT?</strong><br>
    Under a common law UNILATERAL CONTRACT OFFER is one that <strong>unequivocally</strong> indicates <strong>acceptance</strong> can only be manifested by <strong>completion of performance</strong> by the offeree.<br>
    <strong><br>
  </strong></li>
  <li><strong>Was the communication (action) of [date] an (implied) ACCEPTANCE?</strong><br>
    Under the common law MIRROR IMAGE RULE an acceptance is an <strong>unequivocal assent</strong> to an offer. <br>
    <br>
    Under UCC 2-206 an acceptance of an offer not otherwise expressly conditioned may be made in any <strong>REASONABLE MANNER</strong>, including a <strong>promise</strong> to ship or <strong>shipment</strong> of either conforming or non-conforming goods.<br>
    <br>
    But a shipment of <strong>non-conforming goods</strong> as an <strong>express accomodation</strong> is not an acceptance. Under 2-207, allows an acceptance containing <strong>varying terms</strong> to be effective. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Did the VARYING TERMS become part of the contract?</strong><br>
    Under 2-207, varying terms will NOT be included in the contract where parties are <strong>not both merchants.</strong> And even if they are merchants the varying terms still does not become the part of the contract if the offer <strong>expressly limited acceptance </strong>and the offeror <strong>does not agree</strong> to new terms, OR if the varying terms <strong>materially alter </strong>the contract, OR if the party to be bound <strong>objects</strong> to the varying terms within a reasonable period of time.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Had the OFFER LAPSED before acceptance was attempted?</strong><br>
  Under common law an offer LAPSES AND CANNOT BE ACCEPTED unless it is accepted in a <strong>reasonable period</strong> of time. <br>
  <br>
  Oral offers are deemed to lapse at the end of the conversation, and written offers are deemed to lapse within the timeframe implied by the means of dispatch, absent contrary agreement or implication.<br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Was the communication of [date] an EFFECTIVE ACCEPTANCE?</strong><br>
    Under the MAILBOX RULES of the common law an acceptance is effective when dispatched, if dispatched in the <strong>manner specified</strong> in the offer, or by the <strong>same or faster </strong>means the offer was transmitted where the offer does not specify a means of communication.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Was the communication of [date] an EFFECTIVE REJECTION?</strong><br>
    Under the MAILBOX RULES of contract law a <strong>rejection is effective upon receipt</strong> while an <strong>acceptance is effective upon dispatch</strong>. <br>
    <br>
    An exception is made if the <strong>OFFEROR CHANGES POSITION</strong> in reliance upon a communication of rejection, not knowing that an acceptance was dispatched prior to receipt of the rejection. In that case the rejection is effective upon receipt regardless of the fact an acceptance was also dispatched.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Was the communication of [date] an EFFECTIVE REVOCATION?</strong><br>
  Under the MAILBOX RULES revocation of contract offer is usually <strong>effective upon receipt</strong> by the offeree. <br>
  <br>
  For an unequivocal unilateral offer also say, as appropriate,<br>
  Under common law a unilateral offer could be revoked at any time, and revocation of GENERAL OFFERS, reward or bounty offers, was effective when <strong>published in the same manner</strong> the offer was first announced. But modernly <strong>SAVING DOCTRINES</strong> prevent the revocation of a unilateral contract offer if the offeror is <strong>aware the offeree has commenced the requested act </strong>for a reasonable period during which the offeree will be allowed to complete acceptance by performance. <br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Was there an IMPLIED-IN-FACT CONTRACT?</strong><br>
  Under contract law an IMPLIED-IN-FACT CONTRACT will be deemed to have exited, even if there is no express agreement between the parties, if <strong>one party acts to bestow benefits</strong> on the other party<strong> reasonably expecting  to be compensated</strong>, and the other party <strong>knowingly accepts those benefits</strong> knowing that the other party expects to be compensated. <br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Is a WRITING needed?</strong><br>
    Under the STATUTE OF FRAUDS <strong>certain types</strong> of contracts must be written in order to be legally enforced, and one type is a contract for (pick one if it applies here - MARRIAGE, more than a YEAR, LAND, EXECUTOR of an estate, GUARANTEE of a debt). <br>
    <br>
    The mnemonic is 
  MYLEG.<br>
  <br>
  Under UCC 2-201, a contract for <strong>sale</strong> of <strong>goods</strong> worth <strong>$500 or more </strong>must evidenced by a writing sufficient to show the existance of a contract and signed by the party against whom the contract is to be enforced. But between merchants a SALES CONFIRMATION by one listing quantity will bind both parties if the receiving party does not object within 10 days. <br>
  <br>
  Furthermore, the UCC provides exceptions for <strong>SPECIAL MADE GOODS</strong>, where there is an <strong>ADMISSION</strong> by the party to be bound that there had been agreement, where there has been <strong>PARTIAL PERFORMANCE</strong> of the contract (i.e. acceptance of some or all goods  or payment). <br>
  <br>
  Under 2-209 contract modifications must be written to be legally enforceable if the contract, as modified, is for over $500. Otherwise modification agreements will be treated as waivers of conditions that can be always be retracted, unless the Court estops retraction to prent injustice.</li>

</ol>
<p><strong>B. Negligence</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>NEGLIGENCE?</strong><br>
    Under tort law NEGLIGENCE is a <strong>failure to exercise the degree of care</strong> that a <strong>reasonably</strong> prudent <strong>person</strong> would <strong>use</strong> in the same situation. To prevail the plaintiff must usually prove <strong>DUTY</strong>, <strong>BREACH</strong>, <strong>ACTUAL</strong> AND <strong>PROXIMATE</strong> CAUSATION and <strong>DAMAGES</strong>.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>STRICT LIABILITY in NEGLIGENCE?</strong><br>
    Under tort law a defendant that engages in any three activities is STRICTLY LIABLE to any person who is actually and proximate caused injury. These three activities are: 1) keeping a KNOWN DANGEROUS ANIMAL, 2) keeping 
  an EXOTIC ANIMAL of a type that is not commonly domesticated, 3) engaging in ULTRA-HAZARDOUS ACTIVITIES that are unusual, pose extreme risks to others, and are usually subject to strict safe regulation.<br>
  <br>
  If the defendant engages in these activities duty is presumed, and if anyone is caused injured as a result breach is presumed as well.
<br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>DUTY?</strong><br>
  Under tort law the general rule is that a person <strong>has no duty</strong> to act to defend others from harm. A DUTY to act to protect others from harm ONLY arises under five scenarios: [SCRAP]<br>
  <br>
  <strong>STATUTE</strong>, <strong>CONTRACT</strong>, <strong>RELATIONSHIP</strong>, <strong>ASSUMPTION</strong> or where <strong>PERIL</strong> to the plaintiff is caused by the defendant.<br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>NEGLIGENCE PER SE?</strong><br>
    Under tort law a DUTY my be created by a STATUTE (or rule) and violation of the statute is a BREACH of duty making the defendant NEGLIGENT PER SE if the purpose of the statute was 1) to <strong>protect the CLASS OF PEOPLE</strong> to which plaintiff belongs by 2) <strong>preventing the TYPE OF INJURY</strong> that plaintiff suffered.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>DUTY BASED ON PERIL?</strong><br>
  Under tort law defendants that create<strong> reasonably foreseeable dangers</strong> to others have a DUTY based on PERIL to act reasonably to protect others from those dangers. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>In short, write following in exam</strong>:<br>
  Under PALSGRAF, Cardozo said that a duty is only owed to those who are in the <strong>zone of danger</strong> caused by the <strong>defendant's acts.</strong> The Zone of Danger is the area where the defendant’s acts create <strong>reasonably foreseeable peril</strong> to others.<br><br>
Andrews held that if the defendant owes a duty to anyone and breaches it, he should be liable for all injury actually and proximately caused by that breach.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
  In PALSGRAF, CARDOZO argued that the defendants who fail to act reasonably to protect others from the perils they have created should only be liable to plaintiffs who are actually in the <strong>ZONE OF DANGER</strong> at the time of their breach.<br>
  <br>
The Zone of Danger is the area where the acts of the defendant created <strong>reasonably foreseeable</strong> dangers to others.<br>
<br>
ANDREWS argued that defendants who fail to act reasonably to protect others from the perils they have created had always been liable to RESCUERS under the RESCUER DOCTRINE, whether they were in the Zone of Danger  or not and same principal should be appied to all plaintiffs actually and proximately caused injury by the defendants breach of duty.  <br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li>DUTY BASED ON PREMISES LIABILITY?</li>
  <li>ATTRACTIVE NUISANCE DOCTRINE?</li>
  <li>LIABILITY BASED ON RESCUER DOCTRINE / FIREMAN’S RULE?</li>
  <li><strong>BREACH of duty?</strong><br>
    Under tort law a BREACH is the <strong>failure to exercise</strong> DUE CARE. The standard of the care is that level of caution a reasonably prudent person would use in the same circumstances.<br>

  <li><strong>The ACTUAL CAUSE or a SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR causing injury?</strong><br>
    Under tort law the defendant is the ACTUAL CAUSE of injury if the plaintiff would not have been injured <strong>BUT FOR</strong> the acts of the defendant.<br>
    <br>
    If two or more defendants acted negligently, the plaintiff would not have been injured if neither had acted, and the plaintiff cannot reasonably prove she would not have been injured but for the acts of each alone, then each defendant is a SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR causing injury.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>PROXIMATE CAUSE? </strong><br>
    Under tort law PROXIMATE CAUSE means that the injury suffered by the plaintiff was so <strong>DIRECT, NATURAL and FORSEEABLE</strong>, so <strong>close in time and place</strong>, resulting from a <strong>CHAIN OF CAUSATION</strong> begun by the <strong>defendant's acts</strong>, unbroken by <strong>UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENTS</strong> that the law will impose liability for the result.<br>
    <br>
    Generally if<strong> two or more events are actual causes</strong> of the plaintiff's injury, the <strong>last event</strong> will be an UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENT cutting off the liability of all defendants who acted earlier. However, it is a matter  of settled law that <strong>negligent acts</strong> by others are FORESEEABLE so they can never be intervening events. <strong>Acts of nature</strong> e.g. tornados, and <strong>criminal or intentionally tortious acts </strong>by third parties e.g. theft, batteries are presumed to be UNFORESEEABLE and will terminate defendant's liability unless extrinsic evidence shows defendants were aware the subsequent events were likely to occur.<br>
     <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>EGG SHELL PLAINTIFF?</strong><br>
  Under the EGG SHELL PLAINTIFF concept, defendants are liable for the all damages they actaully cause plainttiffs, even if the plaintiffs, though no fault of their own, have <strong>pre-existing conditions</strong> that make them especially vulnerable to injury. <br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>CONTRIBUTORY or COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE?</strong><br>
    Under tort law CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE <strong>completely bars plaintiffs from recovery</strong> in some States if <strong>any negligence</strong> by the plaintiffs helped cause their own injury.<br>
    <br>
    LAST CLEAR CHANCE DOCTRINE to allow negligent plaintiffs to recover anyway if the defendants had the <strong>last clear opportunity</strong> to avoid the accident. <br>
    <br>
    Other States use the COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE approach which does not bar the negligent plaintiff from recovery but <strong>reduces the plaintiff's recovery to reflect the degree of fault shared by plaintiff</strong>. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK?</strong><br>
    Under tort law ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK is a complete bar to recovery for negligence if 1) plaintiff deliberately <strong>put themselves at risk</strong>; 2) with <strong>full awareness</strong> of the risks and 3) a <strong>conscious acceptance</strong> of the risks.<br>
    <br>
    Used mostly in attractive nuisance doctrine and strict liability.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>NEGLIGENT INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS (NIED)?</strong><br>
  Under tort law, a BYSTANDER to an event may bring an action for NEGLIGENT INFLICTION if they suffer <strong>severe emotional distress </strong>and there is a nexus between the negligent act and the injury based on PROXIMITY IN TIME, PLACE and RELATIONSHIP.</li>
