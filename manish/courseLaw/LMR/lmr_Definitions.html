    <td valign="top"><p><strong>A0. Always start the contract Question with following statements:</strong></p>
    <p>The rights and remedies of the parties here depend on whether they had a valid contract. A contract is a promise or set of promises the performance of which the law will recognize as a duty and for the breach of which the law will provide a remedy.</p>
    <p>A valid contract is based on offer, acceptance and consideration for legal purpose between the parties of legal capacity.</p></td>
    <td valign="top"><p><strong>A1. Does UCC apply?</strong></p>
    <p>UCC Article 2 governs contracts for the <strong>sale</strong> of <strong>GOODS</strong>. <strong>GOODS</strong> are <strong>movable</strong> things at the time of identification of the contract.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p></td>
    <td valign="top"><p><strong>Example Template</strong></p>
      <p>Here the quesiton involves a sale of &quot;widgets&quot; and they are clearly movable because they were to be &quot;delivered&quot;.</p>
      <p>OR</p>
      <p>Here the contract is not for a sale of goods because it is a contract for personal services i.e. building a house</p>
    <p>Therefore, <strong>Article 2 of UCC applies</strong> / <strong>only the COMMON LAW applies</strong>.</p></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>These are sales of GOODS: 1) used cars, boats, stereos, RVs for <u>sale</u>; 2) firewood, harvested grain, cows; 3) "cut" flowers, "cut" Christmas trees; 4) "widgets", "gadgets" and "flibits" (if they are to be delivered); 5) carpet, even if installation is included</p>
    <p>These are NOT SALES OF GOODS:  1) houses, land; 2) boats, cars and furniture <u>for rent;</u> 3) standing crops, the <u>right to cut</u> firewood; 4) growing flowers, the <u>right to cut down</u> and take a Christmas tree; 5) stocks, bonds, contracts, copyrights, patents; 6) building structures, even if materials are included; 7) <u>leased</u> equipment</p></td>

    <td valign="top"><p><strong>A2. Types of Contracts</strong></p>
    <p>After above discussion, try to find out the type of contract question, there are 6 types of contract questions and / or mixes of all 6 types</p></td>
    <td valign="top"><p><strong>Type 1: Formation of Contracts - Questions?</strong></p>
    <p>If questions says, a valid contract is formed, then don't discuss formation of contract.</p>
    <p>For formation of contract, go through each communication between the parties one by one addressing these issues in this order.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Was there a valid OFFER?
        <ol>
          <li>Was there manifestation of INTENT?</li>
          <li>Not effectively REVOKED?</li>
          <li>A GENERAL offer?</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Was there an ACCEPTANCE of an offer?
        <ol>
          <li>Not REJECTED by offeree?</li>
          <li>A TIMELY acceptance?</li>
          <li>MIRROR IMAGE RULE (CL) ?</li>
          <li>Accepted by SHIPMENT (UCC) ?</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>What were the TERMS of the contract?
        <ol>
          <li>Is it <strong>unequivocally clear</strong> the offer is for a UNILATERAL contact?</li>
          <li>Certain as to TERMS?</li>
          <li>A DIVISIBILE contract (UCC) ?</li>
          <li>A PRODUCTION or REQUIREMENTS contract (UCC) ?</li>
          <li>Is <strong>timely performance </strong>an express condition or mere covenant?</li>
          <li>Is <strong>personal satisfaction</strong> an express condition or is there just a promise to render <strong>reasonably satisfactory</strong> performance (an implied condition of every contract) ?</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Supported by CONSIDERATION? (Watch for MODIFICATION and ILLUSIONARY PROMISE problems)</li>
      <li>Was the contract for a LEGAL PURPOSE? (Omit if not an issue)</li>
      <li>Between parties with LEGAL CAPACITY? (Watch for MINORS)</li>
    </ol></td>
    <td valign="top"><p><strong>Type 2: Term Disputes</strong></p>
    <p>These raise the questions &quot;What were the terms of the contract?&quot; If FORMATION is in doubt, then the TERMS are probably in dispute as well. Look at the total communication and course of dealing between the parties and address these issues:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Was the agreement CERTAIN that a court can enforce it?
        <ol>
          <li>Remember for UCC only the quantity and parties must be certain.</li>
          <li>Otherwise, were the subject matter, time, price, quantity and parties certain?</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Was there a MODIFICATION that was ineffective because unsupported by consideration? Remember this does not apply the UCC question!</li>
      <li>Does the PAROLE EVIDENCE RULE exclude extrinsic evidence? (Remember the mnemonic DAM FOIL!)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p></td>
    <td valign="top"><p><strong>Type 3: Anticipatory Breach Questions.</strong></p>
      <p>These raise the questions, &quot;Who breached first?&quot; There are two kinds of breach, either <strong>breaches in fact</strong> or <strong>anticipatory repudiation</strong>. </p>
      <p>A breach in fact means that <strong>party did not perform</strong> at the time they were supposed to perform.</p>
      <p>An anticipatory repudiation means that a party <strong>clearly</strong> states an <strong>intent or inability</strong> to perform at some time in the <strong>future</strong>.</p>
      <p>For anticipatory breach questions <strong>look at each communication</strong> between the parties one by one until you find the <strong>first clear breach</strong>. Remember, only one party can breach a contract at a time. Once the first party breaches, the other party CANNOT breach unless the contract is &quot;reformed&quot; by waiver or accord of a good faith dispute.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Was there an ANTICIPATORY REPUDIATION - a clear statement of intent not to perform a future obligation?</li>
        <li>Was there a WAIVER of the anticipatory breach?</li>
        <li>Was there an ACCORD AND SATISFACTION of a good faith dispute?</li>
        <li>Was timely performance an express condition or mere covenant?</li>
        <li>Was personal satisfaction an express condition or is there just a promise to render reasonably satisfactory performance (an implied condition of every contract)?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p></td>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><p><strong>Type 4: Defense Questions</strong></p>
      <p>These raise the following issues:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Does the STATUTE OF FRAUDS (OR UCC 2 - 201 in the case of a sale of goods) require writings?
          <ol>
            <li>Was the need for writing satisfied?</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Did the contract (or modification if not a UCC question) lack CONSIDERATION?</li>
        <li>Was the contract for an ILLEGAL purpose (or unconscionable / adhesion contract) ?</li>
        <li>Was the contract voidable by a MINOR or other party lacking capacity?</li>
        <li>Was the contract void because it was the product of FRAUD or DURESS?</li>
        <li>Was the contract void because of MUTUAL MISTAKE?</li>
        <li>Was the contract void because of performance was IMPOSSIBLE or FRUSTRATION OF PURPOSE?</li>
      </ol></td>
    <td valign="top"><p><strong>Type 5: Third Party Questions</strong></p>
    <p>These raise the question, &quot;Who has the right to enforce?&quot;</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Were there THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES?</li>
      <li>Was there a VALID ASSIGNMENT?</li>
      <li>Was there a VALID DELEGATION?</li>
    </ol></td>
    <td valign="top"><p><strong>Type 6: Remedy Questions</strong></p>
    <p>These raise the question, &quot;What remedy does each party have?&quot;    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Does a party get time to CURE (UCC)?</li>
      <li>What are the UCC remedies (COVER, REJECT, etc)?</li>
      <li>Did the non-breaching party FAIL TO MITIGATE damages?</li>
      <li>Was there SUBSTANTIAL PERFORMANCE (a MINOR breach) or MAJOR breach?</li>
      <li>Can a party obtain SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE?</li>
      <li>Can the non breaching party get CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (LOST PROFITS)?
        <ol>
          <li>Cite Hadley v. Baxendale</li>
          <li>Remember the mnemonic CCCC.</li>
          <li>Were lost profits <strong>Contemplated</strong> by the parties at time of execuation?</li>
          <li>Were lost profits <strong>Caused</strong> by the breach?</li>
          <li>Were lost profits <strong>Certain</strong> as to amounts?</li>
          <li>Was the lost profits something that <strong>Couldn't</strong> be avoided.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Do the SAVING DOCTRINES of the unilateral contract apply?</li>
      <li>If there is NO VALID ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT can the parties obtain EQUITABLE RELIEF?</li>
      <li>Can promises be enforced based on ESTOPPEL?</li>
