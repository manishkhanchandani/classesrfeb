<p><strong>Types of Contracts</strong></p>
<p>After above discussion, try to find out the type of contract question, there are 6 types of contract questions and / or mixes of all 6 types</p>
<p><strong>Type 1: Formation of Contracts - Questions?</strong></p>
<p>If questions says, a valid contract is formed, then don't discuss formation of contract.</p>
<p><strong>Raise issues of whether contract ever formed at all.</strong><br>
  Was there an OFFER?<br>
  ACCEPTANCE?<br>
  Manifestation of INTENT?<br>
  Was the contract for a LEGAL PURPOSE?<br>
  Supported by CONSIDERATION?<br>
  Between parties with LEGAL Capacity?</p>
<p>For formation of contract, go through each communication between the parties one by one addressing these issues in this order.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Was there a valid OFFER?
    <ol>
        <li>Was there manifestation of INTENT?</li>
      <li>Not effectively REVOKED?</li>
      <li>A GENERAL offer?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Was there an ACCEPTANCE of an offer?
    <ol>
        <li>Not REJECTED by offeree?</li>
      <li>A TIMELY acceptance?</li>
      <li>MIRROR IMAGE RULE (CL) ?</li>
      <li>Accepted by SHIPMENT (UCC) ?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What were the TERMS of the contract?
    <ol>
        <li>Is it <strong>unequivocally clear</strong> the offer is for a UNILATERAL contact?</li>
      <li>Certain as to TERMS?</li>
      <li>A DIVISIBILE contract (UCC) ?</li>
      <li>A PRODUCTION or REQUIREMENTS contract (UCC) ?</li>
      <li>Is <strong>timely performance </strong>an express condition or mere covenant?</li>
      <li>Is <strong>personal satisfaction</strong> an express condition or is there just a promise to render <strong>reasonably satisfactory</strong> performance (an implied condition of every contract) ?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Supported by CONSIDERATION? (Watch for MODIFICATION and ILLUSIONARY PROMISE problems)</li>
  <li>Was the contract for a LEGAL PURPOSE? (Omit if not an issue)</li>
  <li>Between parties with LEGAL CAPACITY? (Watch for MINORS)</li>
</ol>
<p>Follow this pattern:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First look at each communication <strong>chronologically</strong> as a <strong>separate issue</strong> to see if it is an <strong>offer</strong>.</li>
  <li>Second, after you find an offer, examine each following communication as a separate issue looking for an acceptance. It often is a rejection and counter-offer.</li>
  <li>Watch out for and apply the mailbox rules to revocations and rejections by mail/fax.</li>
  <li>When you get a valid acceptance to a valid offer, BINGO !, you have a contract. So the <strong>very next single issue</strong> is to determine its <strong>terms</strong>.</li>
  <li>Don't discuss consideration, legal purpose or legal capacity of the parties <strong>unless the facts call for discussion</strong>.
    <ol>
        <li>Remember that consideration is a <strong>bargained for exchange</strong>.</li>
      <li>No <strong>moral obligation</strong></li>
      <li>No <strong>prior consideration</strong></li>
      <li>No promise qualified by a <strong>future decision</strong> to perform.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Type 2: Term Disputes</strong></p>
<p><strong>What were the terms of the contract?</strong><br>
  Sufficiently CERTAIN that a court can enforce?<br>
  Was there a MODIFICATION supported by consideration?<br>
  Is a term or promised performance a MATERIAL CONDITION?<br>
  Is a given term or promise INCLUDED or EXCLUDED from the agreement?</p>
<p>These raise the questions &quot;What were the terms of the contract?&quot; If FORMATION is in doubt, then the TERMS are probably in dispute as well. Look at the total communication and course of dealing between the parties and address these issues:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Was the agreement CERTAIN that a court can enforce it?
    <ol>
        <li>Remember for UCC only the quantity and parties must be certain.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, were the subject matter, time, price, quantity and parties certain?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Was there a MODIFICATION that was ineffective because unsupported by consideration? Remember this does not apply the UCC question!</li>
  <li>Does the PAROLE EVIDENCE RULE exclude extrinsic evidence? (Remember the mnemonic DAM FOIL!)</li>
</ol>
<p>There are <strong>three situations </strong>where the parties dispute the terms. Usually this is <strong>only one issue </strong>and it will be one of the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Is the contract<strong> too uncertain</strong> to be enforced?
    <ol>
        <li>No quantity stated? (Not a UCC <strong>requirements</strong> or <strong>production</strong> contract)</li>
      <li>Parties uncertain?</li>
      <li>Uncertain as to time, price, subject matter? (Not UCC where <strong>gap fillers</strong> apply)<br>
            <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Is the <strong>modification</strong> supported by adequate consideration?
    <ol>
        <li>Prior Obligation?</li>
      <li>This does not apply to UCC where no considerations is needed?<br>
            <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Does the <strong>parole evidence rule</strong> bar extrinsic evidence of additional terms?
    <ol>
        <li>Merger clause?</li>
      <li>Contract complete within the four corners of the document?</li>
      <li>Remember the <strong>exceptions</strong> (mnemonic = DAM FOIL)<br>
            <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Was <strong>time performance</strong> an EXPRESS CONDITION (material condition) or just a COVENANT (not a material condition)?</li>
  <li>Was <strong>personal satisfaction</strong> an EXPRESS CONDITION (a material condition that the buyer must actually be satisfied) or just a COVENANT (an expression of the implied condition inherent in all contracts that performance must be &quot;reasonably satisfactory&quot;)?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Type 3: Anticipatory Breach Questions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Focus on the issue of who breached first?</strong><br>
  Anticipatory Breach?<br>
  Major or Minor Breach?<br>
  Waiver?</p>
<p>These raise the questions, &quot;Who breached first?&quot; There are two kinds of breach, either <strong>breaches in fact</strong> or <strong>anticipatory repudiation</strong>. </p>
<p>A breach in fact means that <strong>party did not perform</strong> at the time they were supposed to perform.</p>
<p>An anticipatory repudiation means that a party <strong>clearly</strong> states an <strong>intent or inability</strong> to perform at some time in the <strong>future</strong>.</p>
<p>For anticipatory breach questions <strong>look at each communication</strong> between the parties one by one until you find the <strong>first clear breach</strong>. Remember, only one party can breach a contract at a time. Once the first party breaches, the other party CANNOT breach unless the contract is &quot;reformed&quot; by waiver or accord of a good faith dispute.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Was there an ANTICIPATORY REPUDIATION - a clear statement of intent not to perform a future obligation?</li>
  <li>Was there a WAIVER of the anticipatory breach?</li>
  <li>Was there an ACCORD AND SATISFACTION of a good faith dispute?</li>
  <li>Was timely performance an express condition or mere covenant?</li>
  <li>Was personal satisfaction an express condition or is there just a promise to render reasonably satisfactory performance (an implied condition of every contract)?</li>
</ol>
<p>These situations are where one party says, &quot;I don't think I can meet the deadline.&quot; Then the other party says, &quot;Oh yeah? Well then the deal's off. Follow this pattern:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Look at each communication as a <strong>separate issue</strong> to see if it is a <strong>clear statement of intent not to perform at a future time</strong>. If a party says they don't think they will be able to perform in the future, that is expression of a <strong>doubt</strong> and not an expression of an <strong>intent</strong>.</li>
  <li>The<strong> first party</strong> to clearly state an intent to not perform is the breaching party.</li>
  <li>When a party breaches the next issue is the effect of the anticipatory breach. 1) <strong>excuses</strong> the non breaching party from performance and it 2) <strong>accelerates</strong> the performance obligation of the breaching party.</li>
  <li>The <strong>next issue </strong>is whether the non-breaching party <strong>waives the breach</strong> by allowing the breaching party to continue performance under the contract.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Type 4: Defense Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Focus on defense issues:</strong><br>
  Statute of Frauds issue?<br>
  Lack of consideration?<br>
  Illegal purpose?<br>
  Rights of underage party?<br>
  Fraud? Duress?</p>
<p>These raise the following issues:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Does the STATUTE OF FRAUDS (OR UCC 2 - 201 in the case of a sale of goods) require writings?
    <ol>
        <li>Was the need for writing satisfied?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Did the contract (or modification if not a UCC question) lack CONSIDERATION?</li>
  <li>Was the contract for an ILLEGAL purpose (or unconscionable / adhesion contract) ?</li>
  <li>Was the contract voidable by a MINOR or other party lacking capacity?</li>
  <li>Was the contract void because it was the product of FRAUD or DURESS?</li>
  <li>Was the contract void because of MUTUAL MISTAKE?</li>
  <li>Was the contract void because of performance was IMPOSSIBLE or FRUSTRATION OF PURPOSE?</li>
</ol>
<p>If there is a breach, go through each of the breaching party's defenses as separate issues:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First, was there an<strong> insufficient writing</strong> to satisffy the Statute of Frauds?</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of consideration</strong>? Prior obligation? Moral obligation? Prior consideration? Gift promise?</li>
  <li>Illegal purpose? Does <strong>in pare delicto</strong> apply?</li>
  <li>Breaching party a <strong>minor</strong> or <strong>incapacitated</strong>? But, did they repudiate within time after removal of incapacity?</li>
  <li>Contract induced by <strong>fraud</strong>, <strong>duress</strong>, or because of <strong>mistake</strong>? Did the non-breaching party know, or should they have known that the other party was mistaken?</li>
  <li><strong>Performance impossible</strong> or <strong>purpose frustrated</strong>? Was it absolutely impossible? These situations violate IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITIONS of the contract, causing it to fail.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Type 5: Third Party Questions</strong></p>
<p>These raise the question, &quot;Who has the right to enforce?&quot;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Were there THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES?</li>
  <li>Was there a VALID ASSIGNMENT?</li>
  <li>Was there a VALID DELEGATION?</li>
</ol>
<p>These are similar to defenses, and the isuses raised are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Does the third party have standing to braing an action? Intended beneficiary?</li>
  <li>Was there an improper assignment of the contract? Notice not given?</li>
  <li>Was there an improper delegation of the contract? Personal services?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Type 6: Remedy Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Raise issues of what each party can recover and how.</strong><br>
  Specific Performance<br>
  Restitution (quantum meruit concepts)?<br>
  Right to Cure?<br>
  Cover?<br>
  Failure to Mitigate?<br>
  Estoppel?<br>
  Saving Doctrines?</p>
<p>These raise the question, &quot;What remedy does each party have?&quot; </p>
<ol>
  <li>Does a party get time to CURE (UCC)?</li>
  <li>What are the UCC remedies (COVER, REJECT, etc)?</li>
  <li>Did the non-breaching party FAIL TO MITIGATE damages?</li>
  <li>Was there SUBSTANTIAL PERFORMANCE (a MINOR breach) or MAJOR breach?</li>
  <li>Can a party obtain SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE?</li>
  <li>Can the non breaching party get CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (LOST PROFITS)?
    <ol>
        <li>Cite Hadley v. Baxendale</li>
      <li>Remember the mnemonic CCCC.</li>
      <li>Were lost profits <strong>Contemplated</strong> by the parties at time of execuation?</li>
      <li>Were lost profits <strong>Caused</strong> by the breach?</li>
      <li>Were lost profits <strong>Certain</strong> as to amounts?</li>
      <li>Was the lost profits something that <strong>Couldn't</strong> be avoided.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Do the SAVING DOCTRINES of the unilateral contract apply?</li>
  <li>If there is NO VALID ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT can the parties obtain EQUITABLE RELIEF?</li>
  <li>Can promises be enforced based on ESTOPPEL?</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of the remedies is a separtate issue. Only discuss the issues that apply.</p>
<ol>
  <li>If there was a valid contract, was there <strong>substantial performance</strong>? Benefit of bargain.</li>
  <li>Can the plaintiff obtain <strong>specific performance</strong>? Unique goods?</li>
  <li>Can the contract be enforced based on <strong>promissory estoppel</strong>? Injustice resulting?</li>
  <li>Can the party obtain <strong>rescission</strong> and <strong>restitution</strong>? Return to status quo?</li>
  <li>Should the damages be reduced because of a failure to mitigate?</li>
  <li>Are <strong>consequential damages</strong> called for? Cite Hadly v Baxendale, and the mnemonic is CCCC.</li>
  <li>If there is NO VALID, ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT what EQUITABLE remedies is available to the parties?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>A0. Always start the contract Question with following statements:</strong></p>
<p>The rights and remedies of the parties here depend on whether they had a valid contract. A contract is a promise or set of promises the performance of which the law will recognize as a duty and for the breach of which the law will provide a remedy.</p>
<p>A valid contract is based on offer, acceptance and consideration for legal purpose between the parties of legal capacity.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>A1. Does UCC apply?</strong></p>
<p>UCC Article 2 governs contracts for the <strong>sale</strong> of <strong>GOODS</strong>. <strong>GOODS</strong> are <strong>movable</strong> things at the time of identification of the contract.</p>
<p><strong>Example Template</strong></p>
<p>Here the quesiton involves a sale of &quot;widgets&quot; and they are clearly movable because they were to be &quot;delivered&quot;.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Here the contract is not for a sale of goods because it is a contract for personal services i.e. building a house</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>Article 2 of UCC applies</strong> / <strong>only the COMMON LAW applies</strong>.</p>
<p>These are sales of GOODS: 1) used cars, boats, stereos, RVs for <u>sale</u>; 2) firewood, harvested grain, cows; 3) "cut" flowers, "cut" Christmas trees; 4) "widgets", "gadgets" and "flibits" (if they are to be delivered); 5) carpet, even if installation is included</p>
<p>These are NOT SALES OF GOODS:  1) houses, land; 2) boats, cars and furniture <u>for rent;</u> 3) standing crops, the <u>right to cut</u> firewood; 4) growing flowers, the <u>right to cut down</u> and take a Christmas tree; 5) stocks, bonds, contracts, copyrights, patents; 6) building structures, even if materials are included; 7) <u>leased</u> equipment</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>A2. </strong><strong> STATUTE OF FRAUDS</strong></p>
<p>Mnemonic for Statute of Frauds is MYLEG. Contracts can be written if they are </p>
<ol>
  <li>a contract for marriage</li>
  <li>a contract that must take more than a year to complete (from date of execution)</li>
  <li>a contract for conveyence of an interest in Land (e.g rental agreements, sales, easements)</li>
  <li>a contract by an Executor of the estate of a deceased, and</li>
  <li>a contract by a Gurantor of a debt</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Common Law</strong><br>
<strong><br>
Issue:</strong> Need for a WRITING?<br>
<strong><br>
Rule:</strong> Under the Statute of Frauds, certain types of contracts must be written in order to be enforced.<br>
[This is always an issue if the contract is described as &quot;oral&quot; because the reader is saying &quot;oral contract&quot; to prompt discussion of this issue. Probably not an issue and not worth discussing if the contract is described as &quot;written&quot;.]<br>
<br>
<strong>Analysis:</strong> One type of contract that requires a writing is a contract for ....<br>
[Pick the following category that applies to your question ...]</p>
<ol>
  <li>Contracts that necessarily take more than a <strong>Year from execution to completion</strong>.</li>
  <li>Contracts for conveyance of interests in <strong>land</strong> or</li>
  <li>Contracts for <strong>Guarantee</strong> of a debt.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here a writing is needed because this is a contract for &quot;marriage&quot; [or land, gurantee of debt, etc.]</p>
<p>Note: If your exam question is of a type that DOES NOT require a writing, and no facts suggest that it might be, you might just say this:</p>
<p>Here no writing is needed because this contract is not of a type falling under the Statute of Frauds. Therefore, there was (not) a need for a writing in order for the agreement to be legally enforced as a contract, and the requirement is (not) met because ....</p>
<p><strong>More Examples of SOF:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>CL: Under the Statute of Frauds, certain types of contracts must be in writing to be enforced. A contract for conveyance of an interest in LAND often requires a writing, but not leaseholds of year or less.<br>
    <br>
    Here the question involves conveyance of an interest in land because the alleged agreement was to rent a 'house', but this appears to be a month to month rental.<br>
    <br>
  Therefore, a writing would not generally be required.</li>
  <li>UCC: Under <strong>UCC 2-201</strong> a contract for the <strong>sale</strong> of GOODS <strong>over $500</strong> requires a writing. This limit is being raised to $5,000 but many States are still using $500 limit. Under the UCC a contract between MERCHANTS may satisfy the need for a writing against both parties if there is a<strong> sales confirmation </strong>indicating the quantity sent to one party by the other and the receiving party <strong>does not object</strong> to the representation ofa contract.<br>
    <br>
  Further, under the UCC there is no need for a writing if goods are <strong>custom made</strong>, the person to be bound <strong>acknowledge the contract</strong> in a legal setting or where a party has <strong>accepted payment or goods</strong>. <br>
  <br>
  Here the goods are over $500 because the tuxedo costs &quot;$519.95&quot; And Al is not a merchant as shown above.<br>
  <br>
  Futhere, this was a &quot;ready-made&quot; tuxedo, not custom made, and Al never acknowledged the contract in a legal setting or accepted the goods.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, a writing <strong>signed by Al </strong>is needed if the contract is to be enforced against him by Bob. </li>
  <li>Under the Statute of Frauds a contract that necessarily takes more than a year to complete from the time of formation must be in writing to be enforceable by law. But if an oral agreement that fails to satisfy the statute is partially or fully performed, it may be enforceable at equity to the extent necessary to prevent injustice. To plead equity one must have &quot;clean hands&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    Here the contract would necessarily take more than a year because it was entered &quot;two days before&quot; Al was 17 and it was to last untill he was over &quot;18&quot;. That is more than a year.<br>
    <br>
  Therefore, the Statute of Frauds required  a writing even if Article 1 of UCC did not. Al only agreed to the contract orally, so and <strong>the contract was not enforceable against him at law because it was oral</strong>. <br>
  <br>
  Further, Tom would be unable to plead &quot;clean hands&quot; because he approves to have taken advantage of Al, a minor, and to have lied to Decra about Al's age.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, Tom would be unable to enforce the oral agreement against Al at either law or equity.  </li>
  <li>Under the Statute of Frauds a contract that necessarily takes more than a year to complete from the time of formation must be in writing to be enforceable by law.<br>
    <br>
    Here, Tom sent Al a &quot;signed&quot; confirmation that &quot;gave all the details&quot;. 
  And Al also has &quot;performed completely&quot;.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore 
  there may be sufficient &quot;writing&quot; signed by Tom that the Statute of Frauds might be satisfied. Otherwise Al would probably be able to force the contract against Tom at equity to the extent necessary to avoid injustice.</li>
  <li>Under the Statute of Frauds certain types of contracts must be in writing to be enforced. A contract for conveyance of an<strong> interest in LAND</strong> generally requires a writing, and contracts that necessarily must take <strong>more than a year</strong> to complete require a writing. <br>
    <br>
  Here the contract is for building a house, and doe not involve conveyance of an interst in land because Homere &quot;already owns&quot; the land. And the contract can be performed in less than a year because it was to be completed before the &quot;Winter rains&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
  Therefore, no writing is required by Statute of Frauds.</li>
  <li>Under the Statute of Frauds certain types of contracts must be in writing to be enforced. A contract for transfer of stock is not one of them.<br>
    <br>
  Therefore, no writing is required by the Statute of Frauds.</li>
  <li>UCC: Under <strong>UCC 2-201</strong> a contract for the <strong>sale</strong> of GOODS <strong>over $500</strong> requires a writing. This limit is being raised to $5,000 but many States are still using $500 limit. <br>
   <br>
     In a contract between MERCHANT the need for a writing may be satisfied by a<strong> sales confirmatio</strong>n indicating the quantity sent to one party by the other if the receiving party has reason to know the contents of the writing and does not object to the representation of a contract withing 10 days.   <br>
     <br>
  Here a writing is needed because the cost of the goods is $60,000 (&quot;10,000&quot; at &quot;$6&quot;). But this is &quot;between merchants&quot; because both parties appear to be merchants, and the 6/4 sales confirmation Sellco sent to Buyco specifies quantity at &quot;10, 000&quot;. That satisfies the requirement of 2-201.</li>

<ol>
  <li>Carl and Homer entered into a valid written contract under which Carl agreed to build a house on Homer's lot. Homer agreed to pay $150,000 for the house. The contract stated: &quot;Homer's duty to pay shall not arise unless and until the house is constructed in full compliance with the attached specifications.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Assume that during his vacation, Homer voluntarily spent two days helping Carl construct the house. At the end of the second day, Carl mentioned the fact that he had an antique weathervane and Homer said he would like to buy it. Carl stated:  &quot;You 've already done enough for me. I'll give the weathervane to you and install it tomorrow.&quot; Homer said: &quot;Thanks a lot.&quot; When Carl refused to deliver or install the weathervane, Homer sued.<br>
    <br>
    The principal question for the court is whether: &quot;<strong>Homer's voluntary work was sufficient consideration for Carl's promise to give Homer the weathervane.</strong>&quot;</li>

<hr>
<p><strong>A5. BREACH  </strong></p>
<p><strong>1. ANTICIPATORY BREACH?</strong></p>
<p>Note: If the non-breaching party allows the breaching party to continue performance after the anticipatory breach, either discuss WAIVER OF THE BREACH as an accompanying issue (see below) or else consider skipping this issue altogether.</p>
<p>Under contract law an ANTICIPATORY REPUDIATION is a <strong>clear statement of intent </strong>or other <strong>clear indication</strong> by a party that <strong>they will not perform</strong> a future obligation. An anticipatory repudiation is a MAJOR breach. The effect is to 1) <strong>excuse</strong> the other party from performance and 2) <strong>accelerate</strong> all future obligations of the breaching party to the present. </p>
<p>If a party has a REASONABLE BASIS to believe the other party may not perform future contractual duties, the party may demand REASONABLE ASSURANCES and REFUSE TO PERFORM until they are provided. Reasonable assurances generally means a financial gurantee or payment into escrow.</p>
<p>If reasonable assurances are properly demanded and not provided, the failure to respond constitutes an anticipatory breach.</p>
<p>Here there was (not) an anticipatory breach because the party said &quot;....&quot; and that (did not) make it clear they were not going to perform. That did (not) form a reasonable basis for (the other party) to demand reasonable assurances because ... Therefore.... </p>
<p><strong>2. WAIVER of the breach?</strong></p>
<p>Note: This is an issue when there is an anticipatory breach or other major breach but afterward the non-breaching party lets the breaching party resume or continue performance.</p>
<p>Under contract law if a non-breaching party lets the breaching party continue performance after an anticipatory breach or other major breach it WAIVES THE BREACH (technically this is called an ELECTION). The waiver cannot be revoked, and the non-breaching party is forever ESTOPPED from citing the breach as major and can only cite it as a minor breach.</p>
<p>Here ... because ... Therefore...  </p>
<p>3. BREACH OF IMPLIED COVENANT?</p>
<p>4. BREACH of contract ? MAJOR or MINOR?</p>
<p><strong>5. ACCORD AND SATISFACTION?</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law an ACCORD AND SATISFACTION is an agreement by the contract parties <strong>to settle</strong> a <strong>reasonable</strong> and<strong> good faith</strong> claim of breach by one of the parties. It is binding on both parties. </p>
<p>The knowing acceptance by one party of any payment or other offer to settle a contract dispute by the other party is generally binding on both parties, even if the party accepting payment says they do so &quot;under protest&quot; or &quot;reserving their claim&quot; or some statement of that type. </p>

  <li>Carl and Homer entered into a valid written contract under which Carl agreed to build a house on Homer's lot. Homer agreed to pay $150,000 for the house. The contract stated: &quot;Homer's duty to pay shall not arise unless and until the house is constructed in full compliance with the attached specifications.&quot;<br>
    <br>
  Assume that shortly after commencing performance Carl called Homer and said that the 1/2 inch rods for the foundation required in the specifications were in short supply, but that 1/4 inch rods were readily available. Homer replied: &quot;Go ahead and use the 1/4 th inch.&quot; One day later, before Carl had bought or installed the rods, Homer called and stated that Carl Must use the 1/2 inch rods. Carl refused to do so. <br>
  <br>
  The best analysis of the parties legal rights is: <strong>&quot;Homer waived his right to have 1/2 inch rods, but he has retracted the waiver so that Carl must use 1/2 inch rods.</strong>&quot;<br>

    <br>
Assume that the contract provided that Homer's payment for the house would be due upon receipt of the architect's certification that the house was built in accordance with the specifications. The architect refused to issue such certification &quot;because the fireplace was not constructed ina workmanlike manner as required by the specifications.&quot; Homer refused to pay the contract price.<br>

<p><strong>A6. THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY contract?</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law a THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY contract is one betwen a promisee who promises to give something of value to a promisor in exchange for the promisor's promise to do something to benefit a third party, the INTENDED THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY. If the purpose of the promisee are gratuitous, the third party beneficiary is called a DONEE BENEFICARY. If the promisee is acting to satisfy a legal obligation, the third party beneficiary is called a CREDITOR BENEFICIARY.</p>
<p>Promisors that breach third party beneficiary contracts are legally liable to both the promisees and all intended beneficiaries. Promisees that breach third party beneficiary contracts are legally liable to promisors and creditor beneficiaries but NOT to donee beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Under early common law parties that breached third party beneficiary contracts were only legally liable to intended beneficiaries that were VESTED because they had been <strong>aware of the existence of the contract and had relied on it</strong> before the breach occured. Modernly that requirement has been adandoned.</p>
<p>Donee beneficiaries can only seek a remedy against breaching <strong>promisees</strong> in EQUITY based on a claim of DETRIMENTAL RELIANCE.</p>
<p>When contrats would incidentally benefit third parties, but their benefit was not the purpose of the contracts, the third parties are called INCIDENTAL BENEFICIARIES. Parties that breach contracts have no liability to <strong>incidental</strong> beneficiaries in law or equity.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Third party questions require that you identify the parties and explain all of the rights and liabilites each party has against th eother parties. That usually takes so much time that there is little time left for anything else.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sample 3 (pg 8) Groucho's rights under a THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY CONTRACT?</strong><br>
    <br>
    Under contract law a THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY CONTRACT is one with main <strong>purpose</strong> of providing a <strong>benefit to a thrid party</strong>. The contract can be enforced by the original party, the promisee, or by a vested intended beneficiary.  <br>
    <br>
  A beneficiary may be a DONEE (of a gift) or a CREDITOR (payment of debt) beneficiary. The beneficiary <strong>vests</strong> upon becoming aware of and changing position in reliance on the contract. <br>
  <br>
  Here the <strong>purpose</strong> of the contract is to <strong>benefit</strong> Chico because he was to get a &quot;new Dodge&quot; as a &quot;birthday present.&quot; Therefore this is a third-party benefit contract. Chico is intended DONEE beneficiary because it is a &quot;birthday present&quot;.<br>
  <br>
  Groucho is the promisee because Harpo promised to &quot;deliver&quot; the car in &quot;two weeks&quot;. Harpo is the <strong>promisor</strong> because he has promised to deliver the car to Chico. <br>
  <br>
  Therefore, this is a third-party beneficiary contract, and Groucho as promisee can enforce it. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Groucho's REMEDIES?</strong><br>
  <br>
  Under the PERFECT TENDER RULE of the UCC a non-breaching buyer in a non-delivery situation can demand conforming goods, repudiate the contract or by goods to cover and demand the excess of the cover price over the contract price. <br>
  <br>
  Here Harpo has breached because he did not deliver the promised car.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, Groucho can demand delivery from Harpo or repudiate the contract and demand return of his $2,000. If he covers by buying the car elsewhere he can demand the excess of his cover price, if any, over the contract price.<br>
  <br>
  </li>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>CHICO V. HARPO </strong>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Chico's rights as a THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY?</strong><br>
            <br>
            Third party beneficiary contracts are defined above. Chico is an intended third-party beneficiary because the known purpose of the original contract was to give him a &quot;birthday present&quot;. He vested when he became aware of the original contract and changed position in reliance.<br>
            <br>
            A vested third-party beneficiary can enforce the contract against the promisor in the same manner as the promisee.<br>
            <br>
          Therefore, Chico can enforce the original contract against Harpo in the same manner and extent as Groucho.<br>
          <br>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Chico's REMEDIES</strong><br>
            <br>
            Chico's remedies would be the same as Groucho. <br>
            <br>

      <li><strong>CHICO V. SWIFTY</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>Chico's rights and remedies against Swifty?</strong><br>
        <br>
      Since Swifty agreed to perform the duties of Harpo, Swifty assumed the same liability as Harpo. And since Chico has the same enforcement rights as Groucho, Chico's rights and remedies to enforce the contract against Swifty are the same as against Harpo. <br>
      <br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>CHICO V. GROUCHO</strong><br>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Chico's rights and remedies against Groucho?</strong><br>
            <br>
            A donee beneficiary cannot enforce the promise of a gift against the promisee at law and can only enforce at equity based on promissory estoppel.<br>
            <br>
            Here Groucho entered into the contract with Harpo to give Chico a GIFT, so Chico was a DONEE beneficiary. Where there is no evidence Groucho has breached the contract with Harpo, and even if he did Chico would have no right to enforce the contract against Groucho at law.<br>
            <br>
            Therefore, if Groucho had refused to perform the contract (e.g. had refused to make the car payments) Chico could only plead equity against Groucho based on principals of promissory estoppel.
            <br>
            <br>
                                    </li>

    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2. ASSIGNMENT of contract benefits?</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law promisees can ASSIGN the benefits they are promised under a contrat to third parties called ASSIGNEES. Promisees who assign contract benefits are called ASSIGNORS.</p>
<p>Contract promises that they &quot;will not be assigned&quot; are &quot;mere covenants&quot; and not express material conditions unless the contract language is <strong>unequivocally clear </strong>that the contract parties intended for non-assignment to be an express material condition. Contract assginments in violation of express material conditions are void ab initio. Contract assignments in breach of mere covenants are minor breaches and promisors have a right to an award of damages against the promisees if any can be proven.</p>
<p>Contract assignments are only EFFECTIVE if assignors <strong>clearly express their intent to assign</strong> the contracts, and <strong>notice of the assignments have been given to the promisors</strong>.</p>
<p>If assignments are for gratuitous purposes the assignees are called DONEE ASSIGNEES and the assignments are LEGALLY REVOCABLE by the assignors untill they have been <strong>stated by assignors in writing</strong> OR a <strong>token chose has been delivered</strong>. Revocation of a gratuitous assignment may be estopped (in equity) based on a claim of detrimental reliance Assignment to a donee assignee is a gift, no contract is created between the assignor and the assignee, and the assignment does not imply any warranties by the assignor.</p>
<p>If assignments are made to satisfy legal obligations the assignees are called CREDITOR ASSIGNEES, the assignments create legal contracts between the assignees and the assignors (promisees), and they are IRREVOCABLE. An assignment to a creditor assignee implies warranties by the assignor 1) that the rights assigne exists, 2) that the promisee/assignor has the authority to assign them to the assignee, and 3) all documents provided to the assignee by the assignor are bone fide. The assignee may seek legal damages from the assignor for a breach of those warranties.</p>
<p>Promisors who breach contracts after they have been effectively assigned (and the assignment has not been effectively revoked) are <strong>only legally liable to the assignees</strong> and are<strong> NOT legally liable to the assignors (original promisees)</strong>. And the promisors can assert any legal or equitable defence against assignees that could have been asserted against the promisees but for the assignment.</p>
<p>Promisees (assignors) are not released from contract obligations by an assignent and if they breach the contracts after they assign them they are <strong>legally</strong> liable to promisors and <strong>creditor assignees</strong> but <strong>NOT to donee assignees</strong>. And the promisees can assert any legal or equitable defense against promisors and assignees that could have been asserted against promisors alone but for the assignment.</p>
<p><strong>Donee</strong> assignees can only seek a remey against breaching <strong>promisees</strong> in EQUITY based on a claim of DETRIMENTAL RELIANCE.</p>
<p>Here ... because .... Therefore ...</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the facts for an essay question say a party &quot;assigns the contract&quot; to a third party, rather than &quot;assigns the contract benefits&quot; that implies there was both an assignment (of contract benefits) and a delegation (of contract duties).</p>
<p><strong>3. MODIFICATION OF CONTRACT AFTER ASSIGNMENT?</strong></p>
<p>If a promisor and promisee agree to modify a contract after the promisee has assigned the contract rights to an assignee, the modification agreement is binding on the assignee IF the contract has <strong>not yet been fully performd</strong> AND the modification is made in good faith in accordance with reasonable commercial standards. The assignee acquires corresponding rights under the modified contract. </p>
<p><strong>Note, for example:</strong> Suppose promisee was to complete performance and be paid on 6/1, and promisee assigned the rights to be paid to assignee. Assignee had a right to be paid on 6/1. But if promisee and promisor agree to delay completion to 7/1 (perhaps because of material shortages) that is binding on assignee. Now assignee has a right to be paid on 7/1 and not on 6/1. </p>
<p><strong>4. DELEGATION of contract duties?</strong></p>
<p>Under Contract law promisors may DELEGATE the duties they have promised to perform under a contract to third parties called DELEGATEES. Promisors who assign conctract duties are called DELEGATORS.</p>
<p>Contracts that necessarily require the personal services of the promisors, and that cannot feasibly be performed by anyone else, are subject to implied material conditions that the promisors cannot delegate contract duties. Otherwise, express contract promises that they &quot;will not be assigned&quot; are &quot;mere covenants&quot; and not express material conditions unless the contract language is <strong>unequivocally clear</strong> that the contract parties intended for personal performance of contract duties by the promisor to be an express material condition.</p>
<p>Delegations of contract duties in violation of express or implied material conditions are void ab initio. Delegations of contract duties in breach of mere covenants are minor breaches and promisors have a right to an award of damages if any can be proven.</p>
<p>Contract delegations are only EFFECTIVE when the delegatee agrees to perform the duties of the promisor/delegator. No notice to the promisee is required.</p>
<p>Delegatees that GRATUITOUSLY agree to perform the duties of delegators/promisors are just volunteers, and they may be called VOLUNTEER DELEGATEES. Volunteer delegatees have no <strong>legal</strong> duty to perform.</p>
<p>Delegetees that agree to perform the duties of delegators/promisors in exchange FOR CONSIDERATION are legally bound in a DELEGATION CONTRACT with the delegator promisor and may be called CONTRACTED DELEGATEES. Contracted delegatees have a legal duty to perform.</p>
<p>Delegation contracts between delegators and contracted delegatees are third party beneficiary contracts because the promisee (in the original contract) is the intended beneficiary of the contract between the delegator and the contracted delegatee.</p>
<p>If delegatees fail to perform the delegator/promisor is always liable to the promisee, regardless whether the delegatee is a volunteer or a contracted delegatee.</p>
<p>If volunteer delegatees fail to perform they have no <strong>legal</strong> duty to anyone. Delegators (promisors) and promisees can only seek a remedy against volunteer delegatees in EQUITY based on claim of detrimental reliance.</p>
<p>If contracted delegatees fail to perform they are <strong>legally liable to both the delegators and the promisees</strong> of the original contract. The action of a promisee against a contracted delegatee is brought as a third party beneficiary under contract between the delegator and the contracted delegatee contract. Contracted delegatees can assert any defense against promisees that they could assert against delegators, and any defenses the delegators could assert against the promisees.</p>
<p>Here .. because ... Therefore..</p>
<p>Note: Like third party beneficiary questions, assignment and delegation questions require that you identify the parties, and explain all of the rights and liabilites each party has against the other parties. That usually takes so much time that there is little time left for anything else.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sample 3 (pg 81) Groucho's rights under the DELEGATION contract?</strong><br>
    Under contract law, a DELEGATION is a second contract conveying the duty of performance under the first contract from the original promisor to a delegatee. The promisor in the first contract retains primary liability to the promisee.
  The delegatee assumes secondary liability to the promisee of the first contract if she expressly accepts the delegation in exchange for consideration, a bargained for exchange of value creating legal liability. In the delegation contract between the promisor / delegator and the delegatee the original promisee is a CREDITOR third-party beneficiary with standing to enforce the contract.<br>
  <br>
  A delegatee can raise all defenses that are available to the promisee in the original contract.<br>
  <br>
  Here there is a delegation contract between Harpo and Swifty supported by consideration because Swifty expressly accepted the duty by saying he &quot;agreed to deliver&quot; in exchange for an &quot;immediate payment of $20,000&quot;.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, Groucho has standing to enforce Swifty's promise to deliver the car as a creditor third party beneficiary.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Groucho's REMEDIES against Swifty?</strong><br>
  A promisee under a contract can enforce the delegation contract as an intended third-party beneficiary in the same way as the original promisee of the delegation agreement (Harpo).<br>
  <br>
  Here Gruocho's remedies against Swifty are the same as his remedies against Harpo, and Groucho can recover from Swifty any amounts he cannot recover from Harpo.
<br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Sample 3 (pg 81) Harpo's rights under the DELEGATION contract?</strong><br>
    Delegation is defined above.<br>
    <br>
    Here the delegation from Harpo to Swifty is a contract between them because Swifty promised &quot;to deliver the car&quot;, and it is a legal contract supported by consideration because Swifty received an &quot;immediate payment of &quot;$20,000&quot;. Swifty was the promisor and Harp the promisee.<br>
    <br>
    Therefore, Harpo can enforce his contract with Swifty and seek recovery from Swifty for any damages due Groucho and / or Chico.  </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>A7. REMEDIES</strong></p>
<p>1. COMMON LAW REMEDY of the NON-BREACHING PARTY?</p>
<p>Under common law the non-breaching party has a right to <strong>COMPENSATORY DAMAGES</strong>, award of a money judgement calculated as the <strong>sum</strong> of:</p>
<ol>
  <li>RELIANCE DAMAGES, expenses incurred in reliance upon the promise of the breaching party,</li>
  <li>EXPECTATION DAMAGES, the loss of expected benefits caused by the breach,</li>
  <li>INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, expenses incurred after the breach as a result (e.g. storage charges),</li>
  <li>CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, lost profits on collateral contracts with third parties that could not be performed because of the breach.</li>
</ol>
<p>Under Hadley v Baxendale, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES can only be awarded if, at the time the original contract was executed, the breaching party knew of or otherwise could have contemplated the non-breaching party would enter into collateral contracts and would lose profits on them as a result of a contract breach.</p>
<p>The burden is on a non-breaching party to prove the damages suffered with CERTAINITY, to prove they were CAUSED BY THE BREACH, and that they COULD NOT BE AVOIDED after the breach occured. By implication this gives the non-breaching party a duty to <strong>mitigate damages</strong>.</p>
<p>As an alternative to requesting a money judgement based on damages the non breaching party has a legal right to demand LEGAL RESTITUTION, a money judgement calculated as the <strong>value of the benefits the breaching party received as a result of the non-breaching party's contract performance</strong>, up to the amount promised under the contract terms.</p>
<p>A non-breaching buyer of unique property may ask the Court (in equity) to award SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE on a claim that award of a money judgement would be an inadequate remedy. Specific performance of services by a natural person cannot be awarded by the Court because it violates the 13th Amendment. And there is no &quot;right&quot; to specific performance.</p>
<p>Here... because ... therefore...</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sample 6 (pg 92): </strong>Under contract law, remedies are COMPENSATORY to give the non-breaching party the benefit of the bargain, the compensation that had been bargained for. If property is UNIQUE money damages are in inadequate remedy and SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE is appropriate.<br>
    <br>
    Here the stock is not &quot;unique&quot; and money damages are adequate.<br>
    <br>
    Therefore Dottie's remedy is an award of money damages equal to the value of the stock.
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Sample 6 (pg 93) EQUITABLE RESITUTION?<br>
  </strong>At equity a party that cannot enforce a promise at law or equity may still seek damages in RESITUTION to prevent UNJUST ENRICHMENT. The measure of damages may be either the benefits their performance conveyed to the breaching party, or else the detriment they have suffered in reasonable reliance.<br>
  <br>
  Here Dottie can seek RESTITUTION for the benefits she conveyed to Fester. He enjoyed benefits that would have cost him $40,000 a year for ten years, so he enjoyed an unjust enrichment of $400,000.<br>
  <br>
  In the alternative Dottie suffered a loss of $50,000 on her house and foregone wages of $2,500,000 over the ten year period, for a total of $2,550,000.<br>
  <br>
  Dottie may seek an award of money damages in these amounts in equitable restitution.<br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Sample 7 (pg 97)
    </strong>Under the UCC a buyer who receives nonconforming goods can REJECT the goods and REPUDIATE the contract. They buyer can COVER by buying the goods elsewhere and demand the excess of the cover price over the contract price, or demand the excess of market price over the contract price.<br>
  <br>
    Here Buyco had a right to reject the goods, and it covered at a price of $5. Since this is less than the $6 contract price, Buyco has suffered <strong>no loss</strong> as a result of the breach and has no right to receive damages from Sellco.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, Buyco's demand for $50,000 has no basis and they would get nothing.</li>
</ol>
<p>2.      COMMON LAW REMEDY of the BREACHING PARTY?</p>
<p>Under contract law a breaching party that has not committed a major breach will be deemed to have SUBSTANTIALLY PERFORMED and has a right to receive all benefits and payments promised under the contract provisions less an OFFSET for the damages (or legal restitution) awarded to the non-breaching party.</p>
<p>A party that has committed a major breach has no <strong>legal</strong> right to any remedy and must plead in equity. A Court of equity may award the breaching party EQUITABLE RESTITUTION for amounts paid and benefits conferred to the extent they exceed damages awarded to the non-breaching party to PREVENT UNJUST ENRICHMENT or FRUSTRATION OF REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS based on a claim of implied-in-law contract.</p>
<p>Here... because ... therefore...</p>
<p>3. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES?</p>
<p>Under contract law a LIQUIDATED DAMAGES CLAUSE will be binding if it was a <strong>reasonable provision at the time the contract was executed</strong>, because it was foreseeable at the time the contract was executed a breach would cause damages that were not foreseeable in amount, AND it produces a <strong>reasonable remedy after the contract is breached</strong>. In this event the sole remedy for the non-breaching party is award of a money judgement in the amount specified in the contract.</p>
<p>Since a money judgement often is not an adequate remedy for a non-breaching buyer of unique property, liquidatd daages clauses generally will not produce a reasonable remedy and will not be binding in that situation.</p>
<p>Here... because ... therefore...</p>
<p>4. IMPLIED-IN-LAW CONTRACT?</p>
<p>IMPLIED-IN-LAW CONTRACT is an equitable theory or &quot;cause of action&quot; that may be pled by a movant when a contract fails or otherwise there is no valid enforceable contract which will provide a remedy. The Court has <strong>discretion</strong> to provide EQUITABLE RESTITUTION when there is <strong>no valid, legally enforceable contract</strong> if the movant<strong> acted to convey benefits</strong> to the responding party with a <strong>reasonable expectaion of being compensated</strong> in return.</p>
<p>The Court may either award the amount necessary to prevent an unjust enrichment to the respondent, or the amount necessary to prevent frustration of the reasonable expectations of the movant.</p>
<p>Here... because ... therefore...</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This argument should only be raised when no contract is otherwise enforceable at law. Perhaps there was a contract that violated the Statute of Frauds, there was a major breach, or the respondent lacked legal capacity. This equitable theory requires that the movant reasonably expected to be paid for services rendered.</p>
<p>5. PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL?</p>
<p>PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL is an equitable theory or &quot;cause of action&quot; that may be pled by a movant when there is <strong>no valid, legally enforceable contract or other legal cause of action</strong> but the movant has acted in<strong> reasonable reliance </strong>on a promise by the respondent,<strong> the respoondent intended to induce the movant to rely</strong> on the promise, and j<strong>ustice demands</strong> that the promise be enforced to some degree.</p>
<p>The Court may either estop the respondent from reneging on the promise or award the movant a money judgement in EQUITABLE RESTITUTION to prevent the respondent from reaping an unjust enrichment or to compensate the movant for injures suffered or to prevent frustration of reasonable expectations.</p>
<p>Here... because ... therefore...</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This argument should only be raised when the movant seeks to enforce an express promise by the respondent and there is no basis for a tort action for fraud or deceit. Often the promise is a <strong>gift promise</strong> or an assurance the respondent will not assert some legal defense or institute some legal action.</p>
<p>Example: </p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sample 4 (pg 86) PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL?</strong><br>
    Under the doctrine of PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL, a party can seek enforcement of an otherwise unenforceable promise where 1) a party <strong>made a promise</strong>; 2) 
  <strong>intending to induce reliance</strong>; 3) there was<strong> reasonable reliance</strong> by the other party and 4) <strong>injustice</strong> will result if the promise is not enforced.<br>
  <br>
  Here Al <strong>made a promise</strong> to Decca because he &quot;agreed on April 1 to a new agreement&quot;, and he did that <strong>intending to induce reliance</strong>. <br>
  <br>
  Al would argue that Decca
  did not reasonably rely because it was aware Al was a minor and could repudiate the contract at any time. Decca would argue that Al would reap an UNJUST ENRICHMENT because it incurred &quot;$360,000 in distributed expense.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, it would appear that Decca's restitution to Al should be reduced to this amount and restricted to the actual profit made by Decca  </li>

<p>6. DETRIMENTAL RELIANCE?</p>
<p>DETRIMENTAL RELIANCE is an equitable theory or &quot;cause of action&quot; that may be pled by a movant there is <strong>no valid, legally enforceable contract or other legal cause of action</strong>, but the movant <strong>acted in reasonable reliance </strong>on EITHER <strong>deliberately false representations of fact by the respondent</strong> OR <strong>deliberately misleading behavior of the respondent</strong> done with <strong>intent to induce reliance by the movant</strong>, and <strong>jutice demands </strong>that the promise be enforced to some degree.</p>
<p>The Court may award the movant a money judgment in EQUITABLE RESTITUTION to prevent the respondent from reaping an unjust enrichment or to compensate the movant for injuries suffered or to prevent frustration of reasonable expectations.</p>
<p>Here... because ... therefore...</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This argument should only be raised when there is no &quot;promise&quot; at all, and no other basis to claim either implied-in-law contract or promissory estoppel. They element here is that respondent must act (or refrain from acting) with deliberate intent to cause the movant to rely on either false statements of fact or else misleading behavior.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sample 6 (pg 93) EQUITABLE RESITUTION?</strong><br>
    <br>
  At equity a party that cannot enforce a promise at law or equity may still seek damages in RESITUTION to prevent UNJUST ENRICHMENT. The measure of damages may be either the benefits their performance conveyed to the breaching party, or else the detriment they have suffered in reasonable reliance.<br>
  <br>
  Here Dottie can seek RESTITUTION for the benefits she conveyed to Fester. He enjoyed benefits that would have cost him $40,000 a year for ten years, so he enjoyed an unjust enrichment of $400,000.<br>
  <br>
  In the alternative Dottie suffered a loss of $50,000 on her house and foregone wages of $2,500,000 over the ten year period, for a total of $2,550,000.<br>
  <br>
  Dottie may seek an award of money damages in these amounts in equitable restitution.</li>

    <p>Carl and Homer entered into a valid written contract under which Carl agreed to build a house on Homer's lot. Homer agreed to pay $150,000 for the house. The contract stated: &quot;Homer's duty to pay shall not arise unless and until the house is constructed in full compliance with the attached specifications.&quot;</p>
    <p>Assume that neither the written agreement nor the specifications mentioned the size of water heater to be installed. Carl installed a 20 gallon heater. The size of the house reasonably required one of at least 40 gallons. After the house was completed, Homer noticed the size of the water heater and said he would not pay the contract price.</p>
    <p>Carl is now entitled to recover from Homer<strong> &quot;the full contract price minus Homer's damages for breach of Carl's implied obligation to install a heater of the size reasonably required.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>SOME ISSUE SPOTTING EXAMPLES:</strong></p>
<blockquote><strong></strong>
    <p><strong>Example 1: </strong><em>"A invited B into his home. While A was called away B found a cutting torch and cracked open A's safe. He looked inside and saw A's credit card. He wrote down the credit card number and later used it to access porn on the internet from the comfort of his home. What is criminal liability of B?"</em></p>
  <strong></strong>
  <p><strong>Issues Presented:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>ARSON because he used a cutting torch, burning open a safe that was part of someone else's home. Was the safe part of the dwelling?</li>
    <li>BURGLARY, not when he went into A's house, because that was consensual, but because he broke ("cracked open") the "safe" which may be an interior room or compartment of a dwelling "A's home" for a theft ("false pretenses"). Was the safe big enough to be burgled? Did he "enter" or just "look" inside? Is false pretenses a felony or larceny sufficient for a burglary charge?</li>
    <li>FALSE PRETENSES because he unlawfully used A's "credit card number."</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>NOT trespass to chattels -- CRIMINAL LAW!</strong></p>
    <p><strong>NOT larceny -- nothing carried away!</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example 2: </strong><em>"Al was so depressed when his significant-other, Bob, moved out on him he drove around town in a total daze. When he saw Bob and Bud walking hand-in-hand, Al burst into tears and drove his car off the edge of the bridge and into the river. Unfortunately Captain Mitch was going under the bridge in his tug boat and he was killed when Al's car fell on him. Al says he blacked out, did not know what he was doing and cannot remember anything. What can Al be charged with (besides a poor choice of men) and what defenses can he raise?"</em></p>
  <p><strong>Issues Presented:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>MURDER based on depraved heart theory? Maybe. Isn't it unreasonably dangerous to "drive in a total daze"? Did he have any <u>awareness</u> of and <u>conscious disregard</u> for the unreasonably high risk to human life his acts posed while driving around in a daze? Certainly he was aware that someone could be killed with him driving around like that. What about suicide? Was he trying to kill himself? Is there a <u>transferred intent</u> where one attempts suicide and ends up killing someone else? No easy answer. Not clear if this was suicide or an accident.</li>
    <li>MANSLAUGHTER (negligent homicide). Very reckless driving in a daze. Al might claim "adequate provocation", but he was already driving around when he saw Bob and Bud. But even if he was <u>unaware</u> and <u>not conscious</u> of the risk his acts posed to others, he can be charged with manslaughter.</li>
    <li>INSANITY? Maybe Al can claim temporary insanity. If he "did not know what he was doing" and was "in a total daze" then he could not realize "the nature and quality of his acts or that it was wrong."</li>

<hr>
<p><strong>HOW TO PHRASE CRIMINAL LAW ISSUES</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. FIRST ANNOUNCE THE DEFENDANT. </strong>A criminal law answer should consist of issues below a heading that shows this case is the STATE versus each DEFENDANT. Underline this.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>For example: </strong><u>State v. John</u></p>
  <strong></strong>
  <p><strong>NEVER COMBINE DEFENDANTS. </strong>Start with the defendant that took the MOST ACTIVE PART in committing the crimes. After completing analysis of all crime issues relevant to that defendant, the analysis of the remaining defendants usually is reduced to questions of accomplice liability.</p>
  <p><strong>WHY ARE THERE MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS ANYWAY? </strong>Law professors do not mindlessly include multiple defendants in an exam question, and the sooner you realize that the better off you will be. The exam writer puts additional defendants into the fact pattern so that YOU will discuss the following: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The two crimes that require two or more people: SOLICITATION and CONSPIRACY;</li>
    <li>The fact that the WHARTON RULE prohibits charging only two defendants with conspiracy to engage in certain crimes like RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY or SELLING DRUGS;</li>
    <li>CONSPIRACY THEORY: That each member of a conspiracy is VICARIOUSLY LIABLE for crimes by other conspirators that are committed <u>during</u> the conspiracy and <u>within the scope</u> of the conspiracy; </li>
    <li>ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY THEORY: That each person that knowingly encourages or helps another person commit a crime becomes liable as an accomplice, not only for the crime they encouraged or helped commit but also VICARIOUSLY LIABLE for all crimes by the other accomplices that are the <u>direct and natural result</u> of the crime they helped commit;</li>
    <li>DEFENSES that might be raised by some but not all of the defendants such as WITHDRAWAL, INSANITY, INTOXICATION and INFANCY.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<strong></strong>
<p><strong>2. ORDER THE ISSUES.</strong> If the CALL of the question does not state and order the issues, you should usually discuss the issues in the ORDER EVENTS TAKE PLACE with the following exceptions:</p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>If there is MORE THAN ONE DEFENDANT and any <u>urging</u> by one for the other to commit any illegal act, discuss SOLICITATION at that point.</li>
    <li>If there is MORE THAN ONE DEFENDANT, discuss CONSPIRACY before discussing the crime that is the goal of the conspiracy (if there enough criminals -- Wharton Rule may require three).</li>
    <li>If there is MORE THAN ONE DEFENDANT analyze the crimes of the most culpable defendant first. Discuss the liability of secondary or marginal defendants second, with a focus on ACCOMPLICE and CONSPIRACY LIABILITY.</li>
    <li>If there is a DEATH, discuss MURDER after all lessor crimes such as robbery, but before MANSLAUGHTER. Focus on MALICE in the murder analysis.</li>
    <li>If there is a DEATH, also discuss MANSLAUGHTER as an alternative lessor offense that both the prosecution and defense might argue as a fallback position to a murder charge.</li>
    <li>Discuss PASSIVE DEFENSES (based on absence of an element of the crime) as part of your analysis of each crime issue itself.</li>
    <li>Discuss AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES (such as self-defense) after the analysis of each crime as a separate issue.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<blockquote><strong></strong>
    <p><strong>For example</strong>, if "Crazy Bob held up the bank and Dick helped him plan it," the structure of the answer would usually be:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong><em><u>People v. Bob</u></em></strong></p>
    <p><em>1) <u>CONSPIRACY?</u></em></p>
    <p><em>2)<u> ROBBERY?</u></em></p>
    <p><u><em>3) DEFENSE OF INSANITY?</em></u></p>
    <p><strong><u><em>People v. Dick</em></u></strong></p>
    <p><em>4<u>) CONSPIRACY LIABILITY for MURDER?</u></em></p>
    <p><em>5<u>)  ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY for ROBBERY?</u></em></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<strong></strong>
<p><strong>3. PHRASE ISSUE STATEMENTS FOR SIMPLE CONCLUSIONS.</strong> Phrase the issue so it can be answered simply. Ask if the defendant can be "charged," NOT whether he is "guilty." Remember, the defendant can almost always be <u>charged</u> with the crime by the District Attorney if the <u>elements</u> of the crime are shown by the facts.</p>
<p>I personally prefer a clear and complete statement of the issue. BUT the sample answers released by the Bar Association clearly show that a "one-word" issue like "CONSPIRACY?" is acceptable to them. But if you do present an abbreviated issue statement BE CERTAIN that you make it very clear in your application of the law to the facts <u>exactly what events you are referring to.</u></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>For example</strong>, if "Crazy Bob held up the bank and Dick helped him plan it," an acceptable answer structure might be:</p>
</blockquote>
<strong></strong>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em><u>People v. Bob</u></em></strong></p>
  <p><strong><em>1) <u>CONSPIRACY?</u></em></strong></p>
  <p>[Rule first and then...] "Here Bob <u>agreed</u> to <u>pursue an illegal goal</u> because he agreed to help Dick "hold up the bank" and that was an illegal goal." </p>
</blockquote>
<strong></strong>
<p><strong>4. STATE THE VICTIM OR OBJECT OF THE CRIME.</strong> If there is more than one criminal act, or more than one possible victim, state the object or victim in the issue statement. If more than one person dies, discuss each death as a separate murder issue. If more than one structure is broken into (a house, a car, a safe, etc.) then discuss each break-in as a separate burglary issue.</p>
<ul>
  <li>NEVER present an issue of just "MURDER?" when <u>more than one person died</u>because the reader won't know which death you are talking about. Say <u>which</u> death you mean.</li>
  <li>NEVER just "BURGLARY?" when the defendant <u>entered more than one structure or room</u>, and each entry might be chargeable as a separate burglary. Say <u>which</u> break-in you mean.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. DON'T COMBINE ASSAULT AND BATTERY.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>NEVER ask if the defendant can be charged with "assault and battery".
      <ul>
        <li>ALWAYS analyze assault as a separate issue from battery.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ALWAYS refer to these <u>crimes</u> as "criminal assault" and "criminal battery" to make it clear you are not talking about the <u>torts</u> of "tortious assault" and "tortious battery."</li>
</ul>
<strong></strong>
<p><strong>6. DON'T FIND ANYONE <u>GUILTY</u> . </strong>Finding people guilty is not a lawyer's job. It is the job of the jury. You are a <u>law</u> student, so start thinking like a lawyer and not like a jury member. There are two attorneys at a criminal trial. The prosecutor decides what charges the evidence will support, and the defender decides what defenses the evidence will support. No attorney at a trial decides guilt or innocence. </p>
<ul>
  <li>So NEVER try to conclude the defendant is "guilty" of murder (unless the 'call' of the question demands it) because it is not your job, and it makes it awkward discussing other possible charges such as manslaughter. By the MERGER RULE the defendant cannot be found "guilty" of manslaughter if he/she has already been found "guilty" of murder. </li>
  <li>ALWAYS say the defendant can (or cannot) be "charged", then you can also argue he could be charged with lesser offenses as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>If the CALL of the question specifically asks, "Can D be found guilty of..." it is a <u>strong hint</u> that the given facts do NOT support the charge stated, and the Reader is testing whether or not you can figure that out. </p>
<strong></strong>
<p><strong>7. STATE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES AS SEPARATE ISSUES.</strong> There are two types of defenses, passive and affirmative.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The criminal prosecution must prove each and every element of a charged offense. A <u>passive defense</u> is an argument by the defense that the evidence fails to prove an element of a crime that must be proven by the prosecution . This should be analyzed in your analysis of whether the defendant can be charged at all.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>ALWAYS discuss the <u>passive defenses as part of your analysis</u> of whether the defendant can be <u>charged.</u></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>An <u>affirmative defense</u> is an entirely <u>separate issue</u> that the defendant should be <u>excused</u> from being found guilty. The defendant (not the prosecution) must prove each and every element of an affirmative defense.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>ALWAYS discuss <u>affirmative defenses as separate issues</u> AFTER you have concluded the defendant can be charged.</p>
    <p><strong>For example</strong>, if Victor attacks Dick with his fists, and Dick pulls out a gun and kills Victor, the <u>first issue</u> is, "ISSUE -- Can Dick be charged with MURDER?" The <u>second issue</u>, and it is a totally separate issue, is, "ISSUE -- Can Dick raise a defense of SELF-DEFENSE?"</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Examples of well stated Criminal Law issues:</strong></p>
<p>I like to see issues spelled out completely as follows, but not every professor likes this approach:</p>

    <li><em><u>CRIMINAL ASSAULT on B?</u></em></li>

<p><strong>CRIMINAL LAW ISSUES AND ANSWERS - </strong></p>
<p>The following show how to <u>phrase and answer</u> the most common issues presented by law-school criminal law essay questions. Analyze each issue by <u>Nailing the Elements</u> as explained elsewhere. A full analysis and conclusion of the first issue is presented below as an example. The analysis and conclusion of the remaining issues has been omitted for brevity.</p>
<p><strong>A PRELIMINARY NOTE ON CAUSALITY</strong>: Some crimes do NOT require that the defendant produce any criminal result. For example, the crimes of solicitation, burglary, conspiracy and larceny are complete at the instant the defendant commits a criminal act, whether or not there is any injury at all to a 'victim'. But other crimes DO require that the defendant <u>actually cause</u> a criminal result or injury to a victim. For example, murder requires that the defendant cause the death of a victim.</p>
<p>It is always a big waste of time discussing causality in a criminal law essay answer if causality is clear. But, on occasion a criminal law essay question will pose a causation problem. Perhaps the defendant "kills" someone who was about to die anyway because of the acts of some second defendant. If a crimes question presents a causation issue of this type, this rule is what you need, and it is useful in both torts and crimes:</p>
<p><strong>ACTUAL CAUSATION RULE:</strong> A particular defendant is the ACTUAL CAUSE of a result if --</p>
<ol>
  <li>EITHER the result <u>would not have occurred</u> but for the particular defendant's act OR</li>
  <li>a) <u>two or more defendants</u> acted, b) <u>no result would have occurred if neither defendant had acted</u> AND c) <u>no evidence</u> shows the particular defendant did <u>not</u> cause the result.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>PROXIMATE CAUSATION RULE:</strong> A particular defendant is the PROXIMATE (legal) CAUSE of a result if it is the <u>direct and natural</u> (foreseeable) consequence. This concept gave rise to two rules, one of which now has limited application and one which is very powerful:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Year and a day: </strong>At common law a homicide could not be charged against a defendant unless the victim died within <u>a year and a day</u> from the date of the defendant's criminal act. Modernly this rule has often been extended by statute.</li>
  <li><strong>Tyler's Last, Unforeseeable, Intentional Act Rule: </strong>If <u>more than one act is an actual cause</u> of a result, the <u>LAST, UNFORESEEABLE, INTENTIONAL ACT</u> is generally held to be the proximate (legal) cause of the result and liability arising from the prior acts is generally cut off. This is a powerful rule with application to both crimes and torts.. </li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. SOLICITATION to commit [crime]?</strong></p>
<p>Under CRIMINAL LAW a SOLICITATION is  the crime of urging another person to commit a crime. The crime of SOLICITATION is complete as soon as the urging takes place, whether the person urged commits the crime urged or not. But if the urged crime is committed the SOLICITATION MERGES into the criminal result and the person committing the solicitation becomes an ACCESSORY BEFORE THE FACT  and VICARIOUSLY LIABLE for the crime based on accomplice  theory.  </p>
<p>Here A urge B to commit the crime of … because…Therefore, the defendant can be charged with solicitation to commit [crime]. </p>
<p><strong>2. CONSPIRACY to commit [crime or other illegal goal]?</strong><br>
  <br>

Under COMMON LAW the crime of CONSPIRACY was  an <strong>agreement</strong> between<strong> two or more</strong> people to work toward an <strong>illegal goal</strong>.  MODERNLY an <strong>OVERT ACT</strong> in furtherance of the conspiracy goal is often required in many Courts. <br><br>

Further, under the PINKERTON RULE , a member of a conspiracy is VICARIOUSLY LIABLE for the criminal acts of co-conspirators done WITHIN THE SCOPE of the conspiracy goal. This means crimes that were 1) <strong>foreseeable</strong> and 2) in <strong>furtherance</strong> of the conspiracy goal.<br><br>

Even if the illegal goal of the conspiracy is attained, the CONSPIRACY DOES NOT MERGE into the criminal result, so each member can be convicted of both conspiracy and the other crimes committed during and within the scope of the conspiracy .
<br><br>
<strong>[State the next paragraph if the conspiracy is to commit a crime that necessarily requires more than two people. Receiving stolen property is one of those crimes.]<br>
</strong><br>

And under the WHARTON RULE a  conspiracy requires the participation of more people than the minimum number necessary to commit the criminal act.
<br>
<strong><br>
[State the next paragraph if a defendant joins a conspiracy in progress.]  </strong><br><br>

If a defendant joins a conspiracy in progress most Courts hold they are not liable for previous crimes of the co-conspirators unless the joining defendant seeks to profit from those prior crimes.<br><br>

 <strong>[State the next sentence when crimes are committed after the conspiracy ends.]</strong><br><br>

 A conspiracy ends when the conspiracy goal is ATTAINED or ABANDONED, and vicarious liability  will no longer attach based on conspiracy theory . But it may still attach based on accomplice  theory.
<br><br>
 Here two or more parties, A and B, agreed to work toward an illegal goal because …And there was an OVERT ACT in furtherance of the conspiracy when ….
<br><br>
Therefore, the defendant can be charged with conspiracy to commit [crime].;</p>
<p>3. <strong>CRIMINAL ASSAULT?</strong></p>
<p>Under CRIMINAL LAW an ASSAULT is  the crime of <u>acting with the intention of causing a battery</u> or else <u>to cause apprehension</u> of a battery. The victim of the attempted battery does not have to be aware of the danger. <strong>Important!</strong></p>
<p><em> </em>Here the defendant <u>attempted to cause a battery</u> (or <u>apprehension of a battery</u>) because …</p>
<p><em> Therefore…</em></p>

  <p>4)      <u>Can the defendant be charged with CRIMINAL BATTERY</u> <u>?</u></p>
  <p> Under CRIMINAL LAW a BATTERY is  the crime of <u>acting with the intention of causing a touching of a victim’s person</u> and <u>causing a harmful or offensive touching</u> . <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p><strong>[Every criminal battery includes a criminal assault as a lesser included offense because an attempted battery is a criminal assault. The assault merges into the larger crime.]</strong></p>
  <p> Here the defendant <u>deliberately acted to cause a touching</u> because…And it caused a <u>harmful</u> (or <u>offensive</u>) <u>touching</u> because…Therefore…</p>
  <p>5)      <u>RAPE?</u> </p>
  <p> Under common law RAPE was  an <u>intentional act to have sexual intercourse</u> with a <u>female without consent</u> causing <u>actual penetration</u>, no matter how slight. At common law it was held to be legally impossible for a husband to rape a wife because consent to sexual intercourse was implied by marriage.  MODERNLY, the crime of rape has been broadly extended to include any non-consensual sexual act involving penetration, regardless of the relative sexes and marital relationship between the defendant and the victim.</p>
  <p> Here there was an <u>intentional act of sexual intercourse</u> because…And the victim <u>did not consent</u> to have sexual intercourse because …</p>
  <p> Therefore the defendant can be charged with rape.</p>
  <p>6)      <u>ARSON</u>? <strong>[Any explosion, smoke or flame raises the issue!!]</strong></p>
  <p> Under common law ARSON was  the <u>malicious burning</u> of the <u>dwelling of another</u>.  MODERNLY arson is extended by statute to the burning of other structures.  Malice for arson means that  the burning must be done with <u>wrongful intent</u>.</p>
  <p> Here there was a <u>burning</u> because…And there was a <u>malicious intent</u>  to burn because … Therefore the defendant can be charged with arson.</p>
  <p>7)      <u>LARCENY?</u> </p>
  <p> Under common law LARCENY was  the <u>trespassory taking</u> and <u>carrying away</u> of the <u>personal property</u> of <u>another</u> with <u>intent</u> to permanently deprive. Where the possession was gained by misrepresentation it was called LARCENY BY TRICK .  MODERNLY larceny is generally codified as “THEFT”.<strong> Important!</strong></p>
  <p><strong>[Only state the next paragraph if there is a theft from a master or employer.]</strong></p>
  <p> Theft of property from a master or employer by a manager or high-level employee was generally embezzlement and not a larceny, unless the defendant got possession by misrepresentation, a larceny by trick. But theft of the same property by a servant or low-level employee was generally larceny, not embezzlement, unless the defendant took possession from a third party before deciding to steal it, and in that case it was embezzlement.</p>
  <p><strong> [Only state the next paragraph if there is “lost” property at issue.]</strong></p>
  <p> Under the RELATION BACK DOCTRINE  some common law courts held that a theft of “lost” property by a person who initially intended to return it to the lawful owner was a larceny because a later decision to steal RELATED BACK to make the original taking unlawful. But other courts held this was embezzlement on the theory the original taking formed a “constructive trust.”</p>
  <p> Here there was a <u>trespassory taking</u> of the <u>personal property of another</u> because…And it was done with <u>intent to permanently deprive</u> because…</p>
  <p> Therefore…</p>
  <p>8)      <u>Can FALSE PRETENSES be charged?</u></p>
  <p> Under common law FALSE PRETENSES was  <u>a MISREPRESENTATION of FACTto obtain TITLE</u> to the property of another with <u>intent to permanently deprive</u>. MODERNLY false pretenses is generally codified as “THEFT”.<strong> Important!</strong></p>
  <p> Here there was <u>intentional misrepresentation of fact to obtain title</u> to property of another because…And there was an <u>intent to permanently deprive</u> because …</p>
  <p> Therefore…</p>
  <p>9)      <u>EMBEZZLEMENT?</u></p>
  <p> Under common law EMBEZZLEMENT was  the crime of <u>TRESPASSORY CONVERSION</u>  of the property of another by <u>one entrusted with lawful possession</u>with <u>intent to permanently deprive</u> or else causing <u>substantial risk of loss</u>. MODERNLY embezzlement is generally codified as “THEFT”.<strong> Important!</strong></p>
  <p><strong>[Only state the next paragraph if there is a theft from a master or employer.]</strong></p>
  <p> Theft of property from a master or employer by a manager or high-level employee was generally embezzlement and not a larceny, unless the defendant got possession by misrepresentation, a larceny by trick. But theft of the same property by a servant or low-level employee was generally larceny, not embezzlement, unless the defendant took possession from a third party before deciding to steal it, and in that case it was embezzlement.</p>
  <p><strong>[Only state the next paragraph if the stolen property was on a common carrier.]</strong></p>
  <p> Further, the COMMON CARRIER DOCTRINE held  that a common carrier such as a taxicab, bus or ship is entrusted with possession of passenger’s property, including lost property, so a theft of passenger property by an employee of a common carrier was more often held to be EMBEZZLEMENT than larceny, even if the property was “lost”.</p>
  <p><strong>[Only state the next paragraph if “lost” property was stolen.]</strong></p>
  <p> When “lost” property was stolen by a defendant who first intended to return it to the lawful owner, many courts found EMBEZZLEMENT on the theory the property was held in a “constructive trust”. But other courts applied the RELATION BACK DOCTRINE  and held it was a larceny because the decision to steal RELATED BACK to make the original taking unlawful.</p>
  <p> Here there was a <u>trespassory conversion</u> of the property of another with <u>intent to permanently deprive</u> or cause <u>substantial risk of loss</u> because …And the <u>defendant was entrusted with possession</u> (or would be deemed to have lawful possession) of the property because…</p>
  <p> Therefore the defendant could (not) be charged with embezzlement.</p>
  <p>10)  <u>Can the defendant be charged with ROBBERY?</u> </p>
  <p> Under CRIMINAL LAW a ROBBERY is  a <u>larceny</u>, defined above (or define larceny here if it was not defined earlier), <u>from a person</u> by use of <u>force or fear</u> to <u>overcome the will of the victim to resist</u>. <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p> Here there was a <u>larceny</u> <u>from the person</u> because…And the defendant used <u>force</u> ( or fear) to overcome the will of the victim to resist because…Therefore…</p>
  <p>11)  <u>BURGLARY?</u> </p>
  <p> Under COMMON LAW a BURGLARY was  the <u>breaking</u> and <u>entering</u> of the <u>dwelling of another</u> in the <u>night</u> with <u>intent</u> to commit a felony. The entry of a structure within the CURTILAGE  of the dwelling also constituted a burglary. <strong>Important! </strong>A physical breaking was generally required, but a CONSTRUCTIVE BREAKING would be found  if entry was the result of TRICK, VIOLENT THREATS, or CONSPIRACY.</p>
  <p> MODERNLY burglary has been extended by statute to all times of the day and all types of structures. Intent to commit a larceny is generally still sufficient to support a burglary charge, even if the larceny is no longer a felony. Further, the “breaking” element will generally be satisfied if there is a TRESPASSORY ENTRY, an entry without consent , express or implied.</p>
  <p> Here there was a <u>breaking</u> and <u>entry</u> (or <u>trespassory entry</u>) into a <u>structure of another</u> because…But it was not a dwelling because it was…And the <u>intent at the time of entry</u> was to commit a felony (or larceny) because…</p>
  <p> Therefore the defendant could not be charged with common law BURGLARY but could be charged modernly.</p>
  <p><strong>[More than any other crime you need to compare and contrast the common law burglary against the modern view and state whether the defendant could be charged under both or only modernly.]</strong></p>
  <p>12)  <u>RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY?</u> </p>
  <p> Under CRIMINAL LAW RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY is  the crime of <u>taking possession or control</u> over <u>stolen personal property</u> while <u>knowing it has been stolen</u> from the lawful possessor. Both the defendant that receives the stolen property and the defendant that provides (delivers) the property are liable.  </p>
  <p>Under the WHARTON RULE there can be no crime of CONSPIRACY TO RECEIVE STOLEN PROPERTY unless there are at least three defendants in agreement.</p>
  <p><strong>[Only state the following if the subject property was placed into the possession of the defendants with the tacit consent of the lawful owner or the police.]</strong></p>
  <p>The crime of receiving stolen property is a legal impossibility if the property was in the possession of the defendants with the CONSENT of the lawful OWNER or the POLICE as part of a “sting” operation. In that case the crime is ATTEMPTED RECEIPT OF STOLEN PROPERTY .</p>
  <p> Here…because…Therefore…</p>
  <p>13)  <u>ATTEMPTED (name the crime attempted)?</u> </p>
  <p> Under CRIMINAL LAW an ATTEMPTED CRIME is a <u>SUBSTANTIAL STEP</u> taken toward committing an <u>INTENDED CRIME</u>. <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p><strong>[Only state the following sentence if the facts suggest an issue of LEGAL IMPOSSIBILITY</strong> <strong>.]</strong></p>
  <p>For an attempted crime to be committed, it must be <u>legally possible</u> for the crime to have been completed <u>at the moment of the first substantial step</u>.</p>
  <p>Here there was a<u> substantial step</u> toward commission of the crime of (name the crime) because …And the defendant <u>intended to commit that crime</u> because…</p>
  <p> Therefore ATTEMPTED (crime) can be charged.</p>
  <p><strong>[There are particular rules for some “attempted” crimes:</strong> </p>
  <p>·        <strong>For any attempted crime to be committed <u>it must be legally possible</u> to commit the intended crime <u>at the instant of the first substantial step</u>.</strong></p>
  <p>·        <strong>There can be NO ATTEMPTED SOLICITATION</strong> <strong> because any “attempt” completes the crime.</strong></p>
  <p>·        <strong>At common law there was NO ATTEMPTED ASSAULT because assault by definition <u>is an attempt</u>.</strong></p>
  <p>·        <strong>And at common law there was NO ATTEMPTED BATTERY because that is the crime of <u>assault</u>.</strong></p>
  <p>·        <strong>There can be NO ATTEMPTED BURGLARY</strong> <strong> unless the defendants approach a structure with intent to enter and commit some other crime and <u>fail to enter at all.</u></strong></p>
  <p>·        <strong>EVERY BURGLARY OR ATTEMPTED BURGLARY</strong> <strong> makes the defendant automatically liable for a SECOND ATTEMPT CRIME because it is a substantial step toward commission the second crime the defendant intends to commit after breaking in.</strong></p>
  <p>·        <strong>There can be NO RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY and can only be a crime of ATTEMPTED RECEIPT if the subject property was conveyed to the receiving defendant with consent of the lawful owner (or the police).</strong></p>
  <p>·        <strong>The crime of ATTEMPTED MURDER requires INTENT TO KILL and no other form of malice for murder will suffice. So there can be NO ATTEMPTED DEPRAVED HEART MURDER and NO ATTEPTED FELONY MURDER.</strong></p>
  <p>·        <strong>There can be NO ATTEMPTED MANSLAUGHTER because the crime is an alternative to a murder charge that requires a completed homicide.]</strong> </p>
  <p>14)  <u>MURDER?</u> </p>
  <p> Under CRIMINAL LAW a MURDER is  an <u>unlawful</u> <u>HOMICIDE</u>, the killing of one human  being by another, with MALICE aforethought. MALICE for murder may be  1) an EXPRESS <u>intent to kill</u>, or IMPLIED by 2) intent to commit <u>GREAT BODILY INJURY</u>, 3) intent to commit an <u>INHERENTLY DANGEROUS FELONY</u>, the FELONY MURDER RULE, or 4) intentional creation of EXTREME RISKS to human life with <u>AWARENESS</u> of and <u>CONSCIOUS DISREGARD</u> for the risks, the DEPRAVED HEART MURDER rule. <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p> Under COMMON LAW there were NO DEGREES of murder but  MODERNLY first degree murder is generally codified as a 1) <u>willful, deliberate and premeditated</u> homicide or one 2) done by <u>enumerated means</u> <u>,</u>  or 3) caused by commission of an <u>enumerated felony</u> .  <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p> <strong>[Only state the following if it is not clear a “living human being” was killed.]</strong></p>
  <p> At common law and modernly, a “human being”  is a person who was born alive and was not yet dead. </p>
  <p><strong>[Only state the following if a death occurs long after the act being blamed.]</strong></p>
  <p> The common law held that there was NO HOMICIDE if the victim died more than a year and a day after the act blamed for the death. Modernly this has been broadly extended by statute. </p>
  <p> <strong>[State the following if the death results from suicide</strong> <strong>.]</strong></p>
  <p> A suicide  is not a homicide. But a death by suicide constitutes a homicide when it is actually and proximately caused by the acts of the defendant. </p>
  <p><strong>[State the following if more than one person was an actual cause of death.]</strong></p>
  <p> The prosecution must prove the defendant was the ACTUAL AND PROXIMATE CAUSE of death, and if more than one act was an actual cause of death, the last, unforeseeable, intentional act generally is the only  legal cause of death and it terminates the criminal liability flowing from all prior acts. Generally negligence by others is presumed to be foreseeable and criminal acts and intentional torts by third parties are presumed to be unforeseeable absent special knowledge.</p>
  <p> <strong>[Only state the following if a death occurs during or after the commission of an inherently dangerous felony (rape</strong> <strong>, robbery, burglary or arson).]</strong></p>
  <p><strong> </strong>Under the FELONY MURDER RULE, a homicide  caused by the commission of an inherently dangerous felony can be prosecuted as a murder if it is the result of acts done within the RES GESTAE of the underlying felony AND results from the INHERENT DANGERS of that type of felony. The RES GESTAE is  the sequence of events beginning with the first substantial step to commit the felony and ending when the defendants leave the scene of the crime and reach a place of relative safety.</p>
  <p><strong>[Only state the following if a death occurs after a break-in to a structure when the defendant’s sole purpose for breaking into the structure was to attack the victim.]</strong></p>
  <p>A murder prosecution cannot be based on the felony murder rule if the death occurred during a burglary that was committed solely for the purpose of attacking the victim because that is not one of the “inherent dangers” of burglary. </p>
  <p>Here there was an <u>unlawful HOMICIDE</u> because the victim was a human being and he was killed by the acts of another human being, the defendant. And there was <u>malice aforethought</u> because…  </p>
  <p>Therefore the defendant can (not) be charged with murder.</p>
  <p><strong>[Once you determine murder can be charged you should almost always discuss the degree of murder that is indicated by the facts as follows.]</strong></p>
  <p> Here the murder would (not) be in the FIRST DEGREE because…</p>
  <p>15)  <u>MITIGATING FACTORS?</u> (Always discuss if defendant kills while mentally impaired.)</p>
  <p> Under CRIMINAL LAW, MITIGATING FACTORS may be  weighed by the jury in determining whether or not a defendant killed with sufficient premeditation to support a finding of first-degree murder or whether the defendant acted with malice aforethought at all for a finding of murder. They may cause the jury to find only manslaughter and not murder.</p>
  <p> Here there were mitigating factors because the defendant was (intoxicated, mentally incapacitated, etc.)… Therefore the jury may find that… </p>
  <p>16)  <u>VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER?</u>(SKIP if the defendant clearly DID NOT intend to kill.)</p>
  <p> Under CRIMINAL LAW, VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER is  an <u>INTENTIONAL</u>, unlawful homicide, the killing of one human being by another, without malice aforethought because of ADEQUATE <u>PROVOCATION</u>. <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p> ADEQUATE PROVOCATION is provocation sufficient  to raise a reasonable person to a murderous rage, which did raise the defendant to such a rage, and which was the actual cause of the homicide.<strong> Important!</strong></p>
  <p> But ADEQUATE PROVOCATION CANNOT BE FOUND if the defendant had enough time before the killing that a reasonable person would have COOLED DOWN and no longer would have been in a murderous rage.</p>
  <p> Here there was a <u>homicide</u> because… And, <u>adequate provocation</u> might be found because…</p>
  <p> Therefore…</p>
  <p>17)  <u>INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER?</u> (SKIP if the defendant clearly DID intend to kill.)</p>
  <p> Under CRIMINAL LAW, INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER is  an <u>UNINTENDED</u> homicide, the killing of one human being by another, as a result of <u>CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE</u> (a.k.a. “negligent homicide”), <u>RECKLESSNESS</u> (a.k.a. “reckless homicide ”), or during the commission of a <u>MALUM IN SE crime</u>insufficient for a charge of murder (a.k.a. “misdemeanor manslaughter ”).<strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p> CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE is a <u>deliberate breach</u> of a <u>pre-existing duty</u> to protect others from extreme risks and RECKLESSNESS is a <u>deliberate creation</u> of extreme risks  to others.</p>
  <p> A MALUM IN SE crime is  one that involves moral turpitude.</p>
  <p> Here there was a <u>homicide</u> because the victim was a human being, and they were killed by the act of the defendant, another human being.</p>
  <p><strong>[The following applies if the death was caused by RECKLESSNESS (or CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE).]</strong></p>
  <p> And the defendant <u>deliberately created extreme risks</u> (or <u>deliberately breached a duty to protect others from extreme risks</u>) because…… But the defendant might not have been fully aware of the risks because…</p>
  <p> Therefore the defendant may be charged with involuntary manslaughter.</p>
  <p>18)  <u>REDLINE RULE?</u></p>
  <p> Under the REDLINE RULE a co-felon  in many States cannot be charged with murder under the FELONY MURDER RULE simply because a <u>co-felon was killed</u>by a <u>victim</u>, <u>bystander</u> or the <u>police</u> during the commission of a crime.</p>
  <p> Here the rule would apply because …</p>
  <p>19)  <u>KIDNAPPING?</u></p>
  <p> Under criminal law KIDNAPPING is  the crime of <u>unlawfully taking</u> or <u>confining people against their will</u>. At common law the victim had to be taken out of the country or across a state line. Modernly this requirement has been dropped.</p>
  <p> Kidnapping is not one of the “inherently dangerous felonies” for the Felony Murder Rule but modernly is often an “enumerated felony” for first-degree murder.</p>
  <p> Here…Therefore…</p>
  <p>20)  <u>MISPRISION?</u> (NEVER DISCUSS this unless the given facts make it entirely clear it is an intended issue  for discussion because this has not been a crime for about 200 years!)</p>
  <p> Under old common law MISPRISION was  the crime of <u>knowingly failing to reportfelonies by others</u> to the police. Modernly there is no general duty to report crimes by others, and the crime of misprision no longer exists generally.</p>
  <p> Here…Therefore…</p>
  <p>21)  <u>COMPOUNDING?</u> (This is a real crime so discuss this instead of misprision.)</p>
  <p> Under criminal law COMPOUNDING is  the crime of <u>taking money or something of value in exchange for a promise to not report crimes</u> committed by others.</p>
  <p> Here…Therefore…</p>
  <p>22)  <u>ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY?</u></p>
  <p> Under criminal law ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY is  <u>vicarious</u> criminal liability for criminal acts of co-criminals that <u>directly and naturally result</u> (foreseeable acts) from the defendant’s own criminal acts. Many Courts do not recognize Withdrawal as a defense to accomplice  liability.</p>
  <p> Here…Therefore…</p>
  <p>23)  <u>DEFENSE of INFANCY?</u> <strong>[Children and youthful defendants!]</strong></p>
  <p>Under the COMMON LAW there as a CONCLUSIVE PRESUMPTION that a child <u>under the age of seven</u> was unable to form CRIMINAL INTENT. There was a REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION that a child <u>between 7 and 14</u> could not form criminal intent, and that a child over the age of 14 could form criminal intent. Modernly similar rules have been adopted by statute.</p>
  <p> Here the defendant may claim he was <u>too young</u> to form criminal intent because…</p>
  <p> Therefore…</p>
  <p>24)  <u>DEFENSE of MISTAKE OF FACT?</u> <strong>[A frequently tested issue.] </strong></p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW a MISTAKE OF FACT is  a complete defense if it negates implied criminal intent. For GENERAL INTENT crimes only a REASONABLE mistake can negate criminal intent. For SPECIFIC INTENT crimes ANY MISTAKE OF FACT may negate criminal intent whether reasonable or not. Battery, rape, burglary, arson, involuntary manslaughter and murders that are not willful and deliberate or based on the felony murder rule are general intent  crimes. All other crimes are SPECIFIC INTENT crimes.</p>
  <p> A REASONABLE MISTAKE OF FACT is one that a <u>reasonable person would have made</u> in the same situation.  VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION  never makes an otherwise unreasonable mistake <u>reasonable</u>.</p>
  <p>A MISTAKE OF FACT is no defense to a charge of ATTEMPT if <u>criminal intent is proven</u> and the mistake merely prevented an otherwise <u>criminal act</u>. </p>
  <p>Here the defendant’s mistake of fact does (not) negate implied criminal intent because…</p>
  <p> Therefore…</p>
  <p>25)  <u>DEFENSE of LEGAL IMPOSSIBILITY?</u></p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW, LEGAL IMPOSSIBILITY  means that an attempted act is not an attempted crime, even if there was criminal intent, when the attempted crime is a <u>legal impossibility</u> at the <u>time</u> of the first <u>substantial step</u>.</p>
  <p>Here the crime charged was a legal impossibility because…  </p>
  <p>Therefore…</p>
  <p>26)  <u>DEFENSE of MISTAKE OF LAW?</u></p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW, A MISTAKE OF LAW about the legality  of an act does not alter the legality of the act. If the defendant commits a criminal act believing it is legal, it is still an illegal act. Likewise, if the defendant commits a legal act believing it is illegal, it is still a legal act.</p>
  <p>Here the defendant’s act was legal (illegal) at the time it was committed because…</p>
  <p>Therefore…</p>
  <p>27)  <u>DEFENSE of FACTUAL IMPOSSIBILITY?</u> </p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW, FACTUAL IMPOSSIBILITY is a defense that  the act actually done by the defendant was NOT A SUBSTANTIAL STEP  toward commission of any crime, despite criminal intent, because the act taken could never produce a criminal result.</p>
  <p>Here the defendant’s act was legal (illegal) at the time it was committed because…</p>
  <p>Therefore…</p>
  <p>28)  <u>DEFENSE of WITHDRAWAL</u>? <strong>[A commonly tested issue.]</strong></p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW, WITHDRAWAL is a defense that  defendants who were members of a CONSPIRACY (or perhaps are accomplices like those who have urged a crime to be committed) are not liable for crimes committed by co-criminals <u>AFTER</u> they have 1) given the co-criminals <u>NOTICE that they are abandoning</u> the criminal enterprise and 2) have TRIED TO STOP the co-criminals from continuing pursuit of the criminal goal.</p>
  <p>Here the defendants did (not) give NOTICE they were abandoning the criminal goal (e.g. conspiracy goal) because… And they did (not) TRY TO STOP the co-criminals from continuing because…Therefore.</p>
  <p>29)  <u>DEFENSE of INSANITY?</u></p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW insanity is a defense if it <u>negates criminal intent</u>. The insanity defense  is now prescribed by statute in almost all jurisdictions. Under the COMMON LAW M’NAUGHTEN RULE insanity was a defense if a <u>disease of the mind</u> at the <u>time of the act</u> prevented the defendant from <u>knowing</u> the nature and quality of his act, or <u>that they were wrong.</u> Under the IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE RULE insanity is  a defense if the defendant <u>knows it is wrong</u> but <u>cannot stop</u>herself.  <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p>  Here the defendant would argue that …Therefore…</p>
  <p>30)  <u>DEFENSE of CONSENT?</u></p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW consent is a defense to some crimes . [e.g. rape, larceny, battery – consent to a touching] The consent must be <u>informed</u>, <u>voluntary</u> and given by one with <u>legal capacity</u>. Further, consent is not a legal defense to an act that deliberately causes great bodily harm.</p>
  <p>Here… because…Therefore…</p>
  <p>31)  <u>DEFENSE of ENTRAPMENT?</u></p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW entrapment is a defense if  <u>criminal intent</u> was the <u>product of improper police behavior</u>.  Courts are split on the application of the entrapment defense, and under the majority view entrapment is no defense if the defendant was <u>predisposed</u> to commit the crime.  Under another minority view entrapment is a defense if <u>police conduct was outrageous</u> and <u>instigated</u> the crime, even though the defendant was predisposed. </p>
  <p>Here… because…Therefore…</p>
  <p>32)  <u>DEFENSE of DURESS?</u></p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW a defense may be raised to crimes, EXCEPT MURDER, that the criminal act was the <u>result</u> of DURESS . </p>
  <p>Here… because…Therefore…</p>
  <p><strong>MBE on Duress</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Frederick threatened Bruce with a physical beating unless Bruce personally wrote, signed and mailed a letter to the President of the United States threatening the President's life. Bruce compiled. A statute makes it a felony &quot;knowingly to mail to any person a letter that threatens the life of the President of the United States.&quot;<br>
      <br>
    Is Bruce guilty of violating that statute? &quot;<strong>No, because of the defense of duress.</strong>&quot;</li>
    <li></li>
  </ol>
  <p>33)  <u>DEFENSE of  NECESSITY?</u></p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW a defense of NECESSITY may be raised to certain crimes.</p>
  <p><strong>[This defense is really nothing more than self-defense, defense of others, or defense of property. And it is probably best addressed under one of those categories in a criminal law answer. The term defense of ‘necessity’ more often has tort connotations, especially when it is a ‘public’ necessity.]</strong></p>
  <p>34)  <u>PREVENTION OF CRIME (AUTHORITY OF LAW)?</u> </p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW a defendant is privileged to act with reasonable force to <u>PREVENT SERIOUS CRIMES</u>  being committed in their presence.  </p>
  <p><strong>[This is only a defense if a crime is about to be committed or already in progress and the defendant is preventing or stopping the crime in progress. It is no defense if the defendant acts AFTER THE CRIME IF OVER, except in the rare fact pattern when a fleeing felon (like a known serial-killer) is shot by police while fleeing because it is the only way to protect future victims from future crimes by the same felon.]</strong></p>
  <p>Here … because…Therefore…</p>
  <p>35)  <u>SELF-DEFENSE?</u> <strong>[A commonly tested issue.]</strong></p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW defendants who are NOT AGGRESSORS may act <u>reasonably</u> as <u>NECESSARY</u> to protect <u>their own safety</u>. Modernly defendants can “hold their ground” and have is no duty to retreat in most jurisdictions. Aggressors are people who  have unreasonably created or increased dangers to others. <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p>Here…because…Therefore…</p>
  <p>36)  <u>DEFENSE of OTHERS?</u> <strong>[A commonly tested issue.]</strong></p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW defendants are privileged to act <u>reasonably</u> as <u>necessary</u>to <u>defend others</u>  who are NOT AGGRESSORS from harm. Aggressors are people who  have unreasonably created or increased dangers to others. Courts are split when a defendant unknowingly acts to defend an AGGRESSOR. Under one view the defendant STEPS INTO THE SHOES  of the aggressor and has no privilege because the aggressor could not claim self-defense.  In other Courts the defendant is privileged to defend the aggressor in a fracas if they act with a <u>REASONABLE BELIEF</u> they  are acting to defend an innocent victim of aggression.</p>
  <p><strong>[It is generally NOT reasonable (and not privileged) to shoot fleeing criminals. The only time it is justified by “defense of others” is if the criminal poses a <u>clear danger</u> to the public safety and there is no other feasible way to stop the criminal from escaping. This is often tested.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>The use of <u>unreasonable</u> force in self-defense, defense of others or defense of property results in an “imperfect” defense claim. Where there is an “imperfect” defense claim, the jury may consider the motivations of the defendant as a MITIGATING FACTOR.]</strong></p>
  <p>Here … because…Therefore…</p>
  <p>37)  <u> DEFENSE of PROPERTY?</u> [A commonly tested issue.]</p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW a defendant is privileged to use reasonable force to protect his own property  or the property of others from harm. It is never reasonable to use deadly force to merely protect property.</p>
  <p><strong>[Note: This is never a defense for the use of deadly force. A defendant has no right to shoot thieves who are running away. But this “imperfect” defense will be a MITIGATING FACTOR for a jury to consider.]</strong></p>
  <p>Here … because…Therefore…</p>

    <li>Frederick threatened Bruce with a physical beating unless Bruce personally wrote, signed and mailed a letter to the President of the United States threatening the President's life.

  <p><strong>CRIMINAL LAW RULES AND DEFINITIONS:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong><strong>ACCOMPLICE (CRIMES): </strong></strong>An accomplice  is a person who urges the commission of a crime or knowingly helps others plan, execute, profit from or escape capture after a crime. At common law accomplices were classified as accessories before the fact, principals, and accessories after the fact. (see ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY.)</li>
    <li><strong>ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY (CRIMES): </strong>Accomplice  liability is a form of <u>vicarious</u>criminal liability for criminal acts of co-criminals that <u>directly and naturally result</u> (foreseeable acts) from the defendant’s own criminal acts. Many Courts do not recognize Withdrawal as a defense to accomplice liability. (see ACCOMPLICE, CONSPIRACY, CONSPIRACY LIABILITY, WITHDRAWAL.)</li>
    <li><strong>ACTUAL CAUSE (CRIMES): </strong>An act is an actual cause of injury if injury would not have occurred <u>but for</u> that act. Actual causation is referred to as "sine qua non." This is the same concept for crimes is the same as it is for torts.</li>
    <li><strong>AGGRESSOR (CRIMES):</strong> The initial aggressor in a fracas is the person who attacks a victim or otherwise starts a fracas. Once a fracas has begun the role of aggressor will switch to any party who unnecessarily escalates the level of violence or unreasonably continues the violence after the other party has attempted to withdraw and escape.</li>
    <li><strong>ARSON (CRIMES):</strong><strong> </strong>Arson is the common law felony of <u>maliciously burning</u> the <u>dwelling</u> of <u>another.</u> Modernly arson has been extended to the malicious burning of almost any structure. Malice for arson requires an act with a <u>wrongful intent</u> to cause a burning, but it is a GENERAL INTENT crime, meaning that MISTAKE OF FACT is not a defense unless it is a <u>reasonable</u> mistake.</li>
    <li><strong>ASSAULT (CRIMES): </strong>Assault is the crime of <u>intentionally acting</u> to <u>cause a battery</u> or <u>cause apprehension of a battery.</u> The victim does not have to be apprehensive. Assault is a SPECIFIC INTENT crime.</li>
    <li><strong>ATTEMPT (CRIMES): </strong>A criminal attempt is a <u>substantial step</u> taken with the <u>specific intent</u> of committing a <u>criminal act</u>. Attempt is a SPECIFIC INTENT crime, meaning that there can be no crime of ATTEMPT unless there was an act taken with the specific intent of committing some other specific crime. Therefore, there can be no "attempted attempt", "attempted second degree murder" or "attempted manslaughter." Further, ASSAULT is specifically defined as an "attempted battery" so there can be no "attempted battery" as a separate crime.</li>
    <li><strong>AUTHORITY OF LAW (CRIMES): </strong>Authority of law is a criminal law defense that otherwise criminal acts, such as battery and larceny, were authorized by law. </li>
    <li><strong>BATTERY (CRIMES): </strong>"I<u>ntentionally acting</u> for the purpose and with the result that there is a <u>harmful or offensive touching</u> of the victim." Battery is a GENERAL INTENT crime. (see GENERAL INTENT.)</li>
    <li><strong>BURGLARY (CRIMES): </strong>At common law burglary was the felony of <u>breaking</u> and <u>entering</u>the <u>dwelling</u> of <u>another</u> in the <u>night</u> with an <u>intent</u> to commit a <u>FELONY</u>. At common law a CONSTRUCTIVE BREAKING was found when entry was made by trick, threat of violence or through the help of a conspirator. The entry of a structure near a dwelling constituted a burglary if it was within the CURTILAGE  of the dwelling. Modernly burglary has generally been extended to any <u>trespassory entry</u> of almost any structure at any time of day or night with intent to commit a felony or larceny. A trespassory entry is any entry made <u>without consent, express or implied</u>. Courts are split as to whether there is a trespassory entry when the defendant has express or implied consent  to enter the structure for other purposes, and some State statutes classify any entry with intent to commit a felony or larceny as a burglary (see CONSTRUCTIVE BREAKING, CURTILAGE, LARCENY.)</li>
    <li><strong>CAUSATION (CRIMES): </strong>The GENERAL INTENT crimes require proof that the defendant 1) acted with criminal intent and 2) the act was the ACTUAL CAUSE and PROXIMATE (legal) CAUSE of a criminal result. [See ACTUAL CAUSE; PROXIMATE CAUSE.]</li>
    <li><strong>COMPOUNDING</strong><strong> (CRIMES):</strong> Compounding is the crime of taking money or something of value from criminals in exchange for agreeing to not report their crimes to the police.</li>
    <li><strong>CONSENT</strong><strong> (CRIMES): </strong>Consent is a defense to some crimes [rape, larceny, battery – consent to a touching] if there is <u>informed, voluntary</u> consent by a person with <u>legal capacity</u>. Consent is never a defense to murder, an act intended to cause serious bodily injury or crimes such as dueling. </li>
    <li><strong>CONSPIRACY</strong><strong> (CRIMES): </strong>A conspiracy is the crime of <u>agreement between two or more people</u> to work toward an <u>illegal goal.</u> Agreement may be <u>express</u> or <u>implied</u> by acts. Modernly an <u>overt act</u>  in furtherance of the conspiracy goal is often required. The WHARTON RULE (which see) requires more participants than are necessary to accomplish the illegal goal (no conspiracy for RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY, sale of illegal drugs, etc. unless three or more defendants participate.)  Conspiracy <u>does not merge</u>  with the illegal goal allowing conviction for conspiracy as a separate crime. (see ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY, MERGER, WITHDRAWAL.) </li>
    <li><strong>CONSPIRACY LIABILITY (CRIMES): </strong>Under the <em>Pinkerton Rule </em>each member of a conspiracy is vicariously liable for the criminal acts of co-conspirators <u>within the scope</u>(foreseeable and in furtherance) of the conspiracy agreement . Each member of the conspiracy may be charged with all crimes committed by other conspirators if they occur <u>after</u> they join the conspiracy, <u>before</u> the conspiracy ends, and before the defendant WITHDRAWS. A defendant that joins a conspiracy in progress is generally not liable for prior crimes committed by co-conspirators unless the defendant has sought to profit from those prior crimes. Most Courts recognize WITHDRAWAL as a defense against liability for crimes of co-conspirators after the withdrawal is effective, and some Courts recognize withdrawal as a defense to the charge of conspiracy itself. (see ACCOMPLICE, ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY, CONSPIRACY, WITHDRAWAL.)</li>
    <li><strong>CONSTRUCTIVE BREAKING (CRIMES): </strong>Under the common law a “breaking” for BURGLARY was deemed to have occurred if the defendants made entry by trick, threats of violence or the help of a co-conspirator. Modernly a sufficient “breaking” is deemed to have occurred if the defendants make a TRESPASSORY ENTRY to a structure. A trespassory entry is one without consent, express or implied. (see BURGLARY).</li>
    <li><strong>CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE (CRIMES):</strong> The <u>deliberate breach</u> of a pre-existing duty to act causing extreme risks to others. For example, a parent deliberately failing to feed an infant. “Deliberateness” of the breach distinguishes criminal negligence  (also called “gross” negligence) from “ordinary” negligence. (Compare to RECKLESS, RECKLESS HOMICIDE. INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER.) </li>
    <li><strong>CURTILAGE (CRIMES): </strong>The area around a dwelling sufficiently close to the dwelling that a breaking and entry might constitute a burglary under common law. (see BURGLARY.)</li>
    <li><strong>CRIME </strong> <strong>PREVENTION</strong><strong> DEFENSE (a.k.a. AUTHORITY OF LAW) </strong><strong>(CRIMES): </strong>A person is privileged to act as <u>reasonably necessary</u> to prevent a serious crime from being committed. This may also be called "authority of law".</li>
    <li><strong>DEFENSE</strong><strong><strong> </strong>of OTHERS (CRIMES, TORTS): </strong>A person is privileged to act as <u>reasonably necessary</u> to protect the safety of others. Jurisdictions are split when a defendant mistakenly acts to protect an <u>aggressor</u> in a fight. Under the STEPS-INTO-THE-SHOES view the defendant <u>steps into the shoes of the aggressor</u> and is not privileged to act to defend the aggressor in a fracas. Under the REASONABLE APPEARANCES view the defendant is privileged to act based on reasonable appearances, even if he acts to protect the aggressor in a fracas mistakenly believing he is aiding the victim of aggression. (See AGGRESSOR.)</li>
    <li><strong>DEFENSE of PROPERTY (CRIMES): </strong>A defense that a person has a right to act <u>reasonably</u> as <u>necessary</u> with <u>non-deadly force</u> to protect property. Never a defense to murder, but MISTAKE OF FACT may be a reasonable alternative. (see DEFENSE of MISTAKE OF FACT.)</li>
    <li><strong>DEPRAVED HEART MURDER (CRIMES): </strong>Depraved Heart Theory is a form of malice aforethought for murder where the defendant 1) <u>deliberately created extreme risks</u> to human life with 2) <u>awareness</u> of the risks and 3) a <u>conscious disregard</u> for the risks.</li>
    <li><strong>D</strong><strong>URESS </strong><strong>DEFENSE </strong><strong>(CRIMES): </strong>A claim of duress is a defense to any crime <u>except murder</u>if the criminal act was done without criminal intent as the <u>result</u> of duress.</li>
    <li>
      <p><strong> EMBEZZLEMENT (CRIMES): </strong>Embezzlement is the crime of <u>intentional trespassory conversion</u> of <u>personal property of another</u> by one <u>entrusted with lawful possession</u>. Modernly defined by statute as THEFT. (see ROBBERY, LARCENY, FALSE PRETENSES.)</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>ENTRAPMENT DEFENSE (CRIMES): </strong>Entrapment is a defense claim that the defendant's <u>criminal </u>intent was the <u>product of improper police </u>behavior. Jurisdictions are split. Under the MAJORITY VIEW entrapment is not a valid defense if the defendant was <u>predisposed</u> to commit the crime charged. Under a MINORITY view entrapment is a valid defense if <u>outrageous</u> police conduct <u>instigated</u> the crime.</li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>FACTUAL IMPOSSIBILITY (CRIMES):</strong> An act is not a “substantial step” sufficient to charge an attempted crime, regardless of criminal intent, if the act done could never result in a criminal result under any reasonable circumstance (e.g. it is not attempted murder  to stick pins in a voodoo doll even if the defendant sincerely believes it will work). (see MISTAKE OF FACT , LEGAL IMPOSSIBILITY  and MISTAKE OF LAW.)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>FALSE PRETENSES (CRIMES): </strong>False pretenses is the crime of <u>obtaining title</u> to the <u>property of another</u> with an <u>intent to permanently deprive</u> by means of <u>intentionally misrepresenting facts.</u> Modernly defined by statute as THEFT. (see ROBBERY, EMBEZZLEMENT, LARCENY.)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>FELONY (CRIMES): </strong>A felony is a crime for which the maximum possible penalty could exceed one year in prison. Under the common law the recognized felonies were murder, rape, manslaughter, robbery, sodomy, larceny, arson, mayhem and burglary <strong>[MR &amp; </strong><strong>MRS</strong> <strong>LAMB]</strong>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong> FELONY MURDER RULE (CRIMES): </strong>The Felony Murder Rule holds that the intent to commit an <u>inherently dangerous felony</u> is sufficient <u>malice aforethought</u> that any <u>unlawful homicide</u> that occurs <u>as a result</u> may be charged as a MURDER. Under the REDLINE RULE many states hold that the killing of a <u>criminal accomplice</u>  by any party other than another criminal accomplice is not chargeable as murder under the Felony Murder Rule. For the Felony Murder Rule to apply a death must result from acts done within the RES GESTAE of the inherently dangerous felony, the sequence of events beginning with the first substantial step toward commission and ending when the defendants have left the scene of the crime and reached a place of relative safety. (see MURDER, REDLINE RULE.)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong> GENERAL INTENT (CRIMES): </strong>Crimes are divided into two groups, GENERAL INTENT and SPECIFIC INTENT. General intent  crimes require the prosecution to prove the defendant 1) <u>intentionally committed a criminal act</u> that 2) <u>caused a criminal result</u>. There must be an intentional criminal act and a criminal result, but there is no requirement to prove that the defendant intended to cause the criminal result. VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION  is <u>never</u> a defense to a general intent crime, and for MISTAKE OF FACT to be a defense, it must be a <u>reasonable</u> mistake. The general intent crimes are BATTERY , RAPE, ARSON, INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER and MURDERS other than those based solely on intent to kill. All others are specific intent  crimes. (See VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION, MISTAKE OF FACT , SPECIFIC INTENT.)</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>GROSS (CRIMINAL) NEGLIGENCE (CRIMES):</strong> A deliberate act creating extreme risks to others but without complete awareness of the risks or conscious disregard for the risks</li>
    <li><strong>HOMICIDE (CRIMES): </strong>A homicide is the killing of one human being by another. Homicide is an element of the crimes of murder and manslaughter but is not a crime in and of itself. At both common law and modernly a "human being" is a person who has been born alive and has not yet died. About half the states have adopted "fetal murder" statutes. Those vary widely but generally make the killing of a fetus with malice aforethought a murder, but do not recognize the fetus as a "human being" for other purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>INFANCY DEFENSE (CRIMES): </strong>Under the common law there was a CONCLUSIVE PRESUMPTION that a child <u>under seven</u> years of age could not form criminal intent, a REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION that a child <u>between seven and fourteen</u> could not form criminal intent, and that a child <u>over fourteen</u> was able to form criminal intent.</li>
    <li><strong>IN</strong><strong>VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION</strong> <strong>DEFENSE </strong><strong>(CRIMES): </strong> Involuntary intoxication is a complete defense to all crimes if it caused the defendants to commit criminal acts.</li>
    <li><strong>INSANITY </strong><strong>DEFENSE </strong><strong>(CRIMES): </strong>Under the M'NAUGHTEN RULE insanity is a complete defense if a defendant suffered from a <u>disease of the mind</u> such that <u>at the time of the crime</u> he was unable to <u>know the nature and quality of his acts</u> (didn't know what he was doing) or else <u>that they were wrong</u> (didn't know he was doing a wrongful thing.)  Subsequently, under the IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE RULE the insanity defense  was extended to those that knew what they were doing, and that it was wrong, but <u>could not control themselves</u>.</li>
    <li><strong>INTENTIONAL ACT (CRIMES): </strong>A volitional act done <u>for the purpose</u> or <u>with knowledge</u> with reasonable certainty that <u>the result will occur</u>. For a GENERAL INTENT crime the prosecution must prove the defendant intended a <u>criminal act</u>, but does not have to prove that the <u>criminal result</u> was intended. For a SPECIFIC INTENT crime the prosecution must prove the defendant acted with an intent to produce the <u>criminal result</u>. (e.g. If defendant intentionally threw a bomb into a crowded theater, prosecution for a general intent crime -- battery, second degree murder, involuntary manslaughter -- only has to prove that the throwing of the bomb was <u>an intentional act</u>that the defendant knew with reasonable certainty would hurt someone. For the prosecution of a specific intent crime -- first degree murder, voluntary manslaughter -- the prosecution must show that the defendant <u>expressly intended to kill</u> someone.) (see GENERAL INTENT, SPECIFIC INTENT.)</li>
    <li><strong>INTENT TO KILL (CRIMES):</strong> Willful, deliberate acts to kill a human being. Only rwo crimes require the prosecution to prove intent to kill, ATTEMPTED MURDER and VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER. No other crimes require proof of intent to kill.</li>
    <li><strong>INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER (CRIMES):</strong> Involuntary manslaughter is an <u>unintentional homicide</u> caused by <u>criminal negligence</u><u> </u> (CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE), <u>recklessness</u>  (RECKLESS HOMICIDE) or the <u>commission of a malum in se crime</u>(MISDEMEANOR MANSLAUGHTER) insufficient to support a charge of murder under the FELONY MURDER RULE. Often this is said to be “without malice aforethought” but the crime does imply malice aforethought, but different from malice for murder. Involuntary manslaughter is a GENERAL INTENT crime. (See RECKLESS HOMICIDE, MISDEMEANOR MANSLAUGHTER, MURDER, HOMICIDE, FELONY MURDER RULE.) </li>
    <li><strong> </strong><strong>KIDNAPPING (CRIMES): </strong>Kidnapping is the crime of <u>unlawfully taking</u> or <u>confining people against their will</u>. At common law the victim had to be taken out of the country or across a state line. Modernly this requirement has been dropped. Kidnapping is not one of the “inherently dangerous felonies” for the Felony Murder Rule but modernly is often an “enumerated felony” for first degree murder. </li>
    <li><strong>LARCENY (CRIMES): </strong>The crime of <u>trespassory taking</u> and <u>carrying away</u> the <u>personal property</u> of <u>another</u> with an <u>intent to permanently deprive</u>. Where possession is gained by misrepresentation it is LARCENY BY TRICK. Modernly larceny is defined by statute under the label of THEFT. (see ROBBERY, EMBEZZLEMENT, FALSE PRETENSES.)  </li>
    <li><strong>LEGAL IMPOSSIBILITY DEFENSE (CRIMES):</strong> Legal impossibility is a defense argument that an act done by the defendant was <u>not a substantial step</u> toward commission of an attempted crime because it never could have produced the criminal result that is a required element of the intended crime under any circumstance (e.g. Bevis tried to murder Butthead by sticking pins in a voodoo doll.) This often involves an attempt to kill a person who is already dead or an attempt to steal property that has been abandoned.</li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>MALICE (CRIMES): </strong>Malice in criminal law is the requisite “mens rea” or “criminal intent” required to be found for a defendant to be guilty of a crime. Malice for <u>murder</u> may be shown by express <u>intent to kill</u>, intent to commit <u>great bodily injury</u>, intent to commit an <u>inherently dangerous felony</u> (see FELONY MURDER RULE) or intent to commit an act with an <u>awareness of and conscious disregard</u> for unreasonable risks to life (see DEPRAVED HEART MURDER.)  Malice for <u>arson</u> requires intent to <u>cause a burning</u> for any <u>unlawful or wrongful purpose.</u></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>MALUM IN SE CRIMES (CRIMES): </strong>Crimes that involve <u>immoral and wrongful behavior</u> rather than merely regulatory and procedural rules such as traffic laws (which are by contrast called malum prohibitum crimes). </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>MANSLAUGHTER (CRIMES):</strong> The crime of <u>unlawful </u>homicide either with intent to kill but without malice aforethought (VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER) or without intent to kill but with malice aforethought insufficient to find MURDER (INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER.) </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>MERGER (CRIMES):</strong> A defendant can be CHARGED with crimes and the LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES implied by that same crime. But the defendant cannot be CONVICTED of both a crime and the lesser included offenses implied by that same crime because the lesser included offenses MERGE into the conviction for the larger crime.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>MISDEMEANOR MANSLAUGHTER (CRIMES): </strong>The crime of INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER <u>resulting from the commission of a crime</u> insufficient to support a charge of murder under the FELONY-MURDER RULE. Involuntary manslaughter is a GENERAL INTENT crime. (see FELONY-MURDER RULE, MURDER, INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER.) </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>MISPRISION (CRIMES): </strong>Under the common law MISPRISION was the crime of knowingly failing to report a crime committed by another person to the police. Modernly there is no generally duty to report crimes to the police and misprision no longer is recognized as a crime.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>MISTAKE OF </strong><strong>FACT</strong><strong></strong><strong> DEFENSE </strong><strong>(CRIMES):</strong> A mistake of fact is a defense argument that the defendant <u>did not have the criminal intent</u> necessary to be guilty of the crime charged. It is only a valid defense argument if it negates <u>implied</u> criminal intent, and is not a valid argument if criminal intent is <u>expressly</u> shown by the facts.. It is a defense to both GENERAL and SPECIFIC INTENT crimes. It is a valid defense if it negates the implied intent to either <u>commit the criminal act</u> charged (GENERAL INTENT crimes) or to <u>cause the criminal result</u>charged (SPECIFIC INTENT crimes). For a GENERAL INTENT crime the mistake must be <u>reasonable,</u> but for SPECIFIC INTENT crimes the mistake must only be actual. A reasonable mistake is one that a reasonable person would have made in the same situation.  <u>VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION</u> <u> never justifies</u> an otherwise unreasonable mistake. (see SPECIFIC INTENT, GENERAL INTENT, FACTUAL IMPOSSIBILITY, LEGAL IMPOSSIBILITY , MISTAKE OF LAW.)</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>MISTAKE OF LAW DEFENSE (CRIMES): </strong><u>A mistake about the legality of an intended act does not alter the legality of the attempted or committed act</u>. If the defendant intends an act believing it to be legal, and it is illegal at the time attempted or committed, it is still illegal despite his intent. If the defendant intends an act believing it to be illegal, and it is not illegal at the time attempted or committed, it is legal despite his belief. (e.g. If the defendant intends to murder the victim, but at the time of action the victim has already died from other causes, the act taken by defendant is not illegal.)</li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>MURDER (CRIMES): </strong>Murder is an <u>unlawful homicide</u>, the <u>killing</u> of one <u>human being</u> <u>by another,</u> with <u>malice</u> aforethought. Malice for murder may be 1) express <u>intent to kill</u>, or implied by 2) <u>intentionally causing great bodily injury</u>, 3) intentionally committing an <u>inherently dangerous felony</u>, the FELONY MURDER RULE, or 4) intentionally acting with an <u>awareness of and conscious disregard for unreasonable risks to human life</u>, the DEPRAVED HEART THEORY. At common law there were no degrees of murder but modernly statutes define first degree murder as those that are 1) <u>willful, deliberate and premeditated</u>, 2) by <u>enumerated means</u>, or 3) caused by the commission of <u>enumerated dangerous felonies.</u> All other murders are in the second degree. Murder is a SPECIFIC INTENT crime when it is based solely on intent to kill. Murder otherwise is a GENERAL INTENT crime. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>NEGLIGENT HOMICIDE (CRIMES): </strong>The crime of INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER caused by CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE, the deliberate breach of a duty to act to protect others from extreme risks . (see INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER, MURDER.)</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>PROXIMATE CAUSE (CRIMES):</strong> Proximate (legal) cause means that the criminal result required for a crime was the direct and natural result of the act the defendant did with criminal intent. But when independent acts by two or more people are all ACTUAL CAUSES of the criminal result, the <u>last, unforeseeable, intentional act</u> is generally held to be the only proximate (legal) cause of the result and proximate causation and criminal liability for all prior acts is terminated. And at common law an act was not deemed to be the cause of a <u>homicide</u> if the death occurred more than a year and a day after the act took place.</li>
    <li><strong>RAPE (CRIMES): </strong>The crime of <u>intentional sexual intercourse</u> with the slightest penetration <u>without consent</u>. Under the common law RAPE required the victim to be a <u>female</u> and <u>not the wife</u> of the defendant. Modernly RAPE is defined by statute. Rape is a GENERAL INTENT crime, meaning that VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION is <u>never</u> a defense and MISTAKE OF FACT is only a defense if it was <u>reasonable.</u> (see GENERAL INTENT, VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION, MISTAKE OF FACT.)</li>
    <li><strong>RECKLESSNESS (TORTS, CRIMES):</strong>Reckless acts are those done <u>deliberately</u> to create <u>extreme risks</u> to others. (See RECKLESS HOMICIDE, ACTUAL MALICE.)</li>
    <li>
      <p><strong> RECKLESS HOMICIDE (CRIMES):</strong> The crime of INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER, an unintended homicide caused by <u>deliberate</u> acts that created <u>extreme risks</u> to others, but insufficient to charge murder on depraved heart  theory, perhaps because of a <u>lack of awareness</u>or <u>lack of conscious disregard</u> of the risks to human life. “Deliberateness” in creating <u>extreme and obvious dangers</u> distinguishes recklessness  from risks created by “ordinary” negligence. For example, street racing is reckless behavior while the inadvertent running of a red light is not. (See INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER, CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE, MURDER.) </p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>REDLINE RULE (CRIMES): </strong>A defense to murder recognized in California and some other states that the killing of a <u>criminal accomplice</u> by any party <u>other than another criminal accomplice</u> during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony is a lawful act and NOT UNLAWFUL HOMICIDE so it cannot be used as a basis for charging the surviving accomplice with murder under the FELONY-MURDER RULE. (see MURDER, FELONY-MURDER RULE.)</li>
    <li><strong>RES GESTAE (CRIMES): </strong>The acts that give rise to a charge of murder based solely on the FELONY-MURDER RULE, beginning with the first substantial steps to commit an inherently dangerous felony and ending when the defendants reach a place of relative safety. (see FELONY-MURDER RULE.)</li>
    <li><strong>ROBBERY (CRIMES): </strong>The crime of <u>larceny</u>, the <u>trespassory taking and carrying away of personal property of another</u>, <u>from the person</u> by use of <u>force</u> or <u>fear</u>. (see LARCENY.)</li>
    <li><strong>SELF-DEFENSE (CRIMES): </strong>A person who is <u>not the aggressor</u> in a fracas is privileged to act as <u>reasonably necessary</u> to protect his or her own safety. This is NOT a defense if the party was the <u>aggressor</u> unless they are no longer the aggressor because they <u>attempted withdrawal</u>from the fracas or the other party <u>escalated the level of violence</u>. (see AGGRESSOR, NECESSITY.)</li>
    <li> <strong>SOLICITATION (CRIMES): </strong>A solicitation is the crime of <u>urging another person</u> to commit a <u>crime</u>. If the person urged commits the crime, the solicitation <u>merges</u> into the criminal result and cannot be convicted as a separate crime (see CONSPIRACY.)</li>
    <li><strong>SPECIFIC INTENT (CRIMES): </strong>Crimes are divided into two groups, GENERAL INTENT and SPECIFIC INTENT. Specific intent  means that the defendant must act with the intent of producing a SPECIFIC criminal result. VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION  and <u>any</u> MISTAKE OF FACT is a possible defense to a specific intent crime if it negates the intent to cause the specific criminal result. All crimes are specific intent except for BATTERY , RAPE, ARSON, INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER and MURDERS which do not involve allegations of intent to kill. All other crimes are specific intent crimes. (see GENERAL INTENT, MISTAKE OF FACT , VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.)</li>
    <li><strong>STATUTORY RAPE (CRIMES): </strong>Statutory rape is the statutory crime of having sexual intercourse with a minor below the statutory ‘age of consent’. It is a strict liability crime and a MISTAKE OF FACT , whether reasonable or unreasonable, is generally not a defense. (see MISTAKE OF FACT .)</li>
    <li><strong>UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENTS (TORTS/CRIMES):</strong> If a subsequent act by a third party, or natural event (“act of God”) is also an actual cause of the injury suffered by a plaintiff or victim, if will generally be viewed as an “unforeseeable intervening event” that terminates proximate cause and ends the liability of defendants that acted earlier. But negligence by a third party is presumed to be foreseeable and will not terminate proximate causation or liability. Criminal acts and intentional torts by third parties are presumed to be unforeseeable and will terminate all liability of defendants that acted earlier UNLESS the defendant knew the subsequent criminal act or intentional tort by the third party was likely to occur. (see PROXIMATE CAUSE.)</li>
    <li><strong>VICARIOUS LIABILITY (CRIMES): </strong>A defendant may be vicariously liable for the crimes of other defendants based on either ACCOMPLICE or CONSPIRACY theory.</li>
    <li><strong>VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION</strong><strong> DEFENSE</strong><strong> (CRIMES): </strong> Defendants may claim a lack of criminal intent if they were so intoxicated, through their own knowing acts, they were unable to form the SPECIFIC INTENT necessary for a specific intent  crime charged. But voluntary intoxication  is never a defense to a GENERAL INTENT crime (see SPECIFIC INTENT, GENERAL INTENT.)  </li>
    <li><strong>VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER (CRIMES):</strong> Voluntary manslaughter is an <u>intentional homicide without malice aforethought</u>. Generally that is because of <u>adequate provocation</u>sufficient to raise a reasonable person to a fit of rage which could and actually did cause the homicide. Intent to kill must be proven. Voluntary manslaughter is a SPECIFIC INTENT crime. (See MURDER, HOMICIDE.)</li>
    <li><strong>WITHDRAWAL</strong><strong> DEFENSE</strong><strong> (CRIMES): </strong>Members of CONSPIRACIES who WITHDRAW from the conspiracy by 1) giving <u>notice</u> that they will no longer help to further the conspiracy goal and 2) <u>acting to thwart</u> the remaining conspirators from attaining the conspiracy goal generally cannot be charged with subsequent crimes committed by other conspirators based on CONSPIRACY LIABILITY. Courts vary widely with regard to the requirements and extent of this defense. Some cases have allowed withdrawal to be a defense to both conspiracy liability and ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY. In some Courts the defense of withdrawal requires the defendant to report the conspiracy to the police. And some Courts view withdrawal as a defense to the crime of conspiracy itself rather than just a defense to subsequent crimes by co-conspirators. (see CONSPIRACY LIABILITY, ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY.)</li>

<p><strong>SOME ISSUE SPOTTING EXAMPLES:</strong></p>
<blockquote><strong></strong>
    <p><strong>Example 1: </strong><em>"Al went to the edge of town where there was a deserted rock quarry 100 feet deep. He liked to shoot his gun there because it was so safe. Unknown to him Bob the wino had fallen into the quarry in a drunken stupor. Bob knew he was in danger, but he went to sleep in an abandoned car at the bottom anyway. Al intentionally shot at a beer bottle, and the bullet hit the bottle just as he intended. Then the bullet went into the quarry like he intended and there it hit Bob in the leg. What actions can Bob bring against Al, and what are Al's defenses?"</em></p>
  <strong></strong>
  <p><strong>Issues:</strong> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1) BATTERY because the question says "intentionally shot" and "he intended". Even though Al did not intend to hit Bob, the grader "intends" for you to discuss intent. So do it.</p>
    <p>2) NEGLIGENCE. Did Al have a duty to Bob? Yes. Did he breach the duty by not being careful? Probably not. Was Al the "proximate cause" of Bob's injury or was Bob's falling in the quarry an intervening cause?</p>
    <p>3) CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE. Clearly Bob helped cause of his injury.</p>
    <p>4) COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE -- same thing.</p>
    <p>5) ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK -- Bob "knew he was in danger."</p>
  </blockquote>

<hr>
<p><strong>HOW TO PHRASE TORT ISSUES - </strong></p>
<p>These rules apply to all torts, whether intentional torts or negligence.</p>
<strong></strong>
<p><strong>1. FIRST ANNOUNCE ONE PLAINTIFF AGAINST ONE DEFENDANT. </strong>A tort law answer should consist of issues below a heading that shows the rights of ONE PLAINTIFF against ONE DEFENDANT. Underline this. Often the PLAINTIFF will have a name that begins with "P" and the DEFENDANT'S name will often begin with "D".</p>
<p>Even if the call of the question says "What are Dick and Bob's liability to Peter?" Still do it this way: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>For example:  </strong><u>Peter v. Dick</u> </p>
  <p>                        <u>Peter v. Bob</u></p>
  <strong></strong>
  <p><strong>ALMOST NEVER COMBINE PLAINTIFFS OR DEFENDANTS! </strong>Almost never try analyzing "Peter v. Tom and Dick", and never try analyzing "Peter and Paul v. Mary." It simply won't work and is not what the professor wants to hear. </p>
  <p>Instead, start analyzing the rights of the FIRST plaintiff mentioned, or the plaintiff with the MOST SERIOUS INJURY, versus the FIRST defendant mentioned or the defendant that took the MOST ACTIVE PART in committing the torts. Sometimes the NAMES give a clue as to what structure the professor wants -- Are the defendants named ABEL, BAKER and CHARLIE? </p>
  <p>After completing analysis of all tort issues relevant to that defendant, the analysis of the remaining defendants usually is reduced to reference back to the prior analysis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2. DETERMINE THE TYPE OF TORT QUESTION. </strong>There are 5 basic types of tort essay questions. No matter which type you have, you should skip issues if the particular question does not call for their discussion.</p>
<ol>
  <strong></strong>
  <li><strong>INTENTIONAL TORTS AND NEGLIGENCE </strong>– There are either deliberate ACTS which cause CONFINEMENT, FEAR, OFFENSE or PHYSICAL harm or NEGLIGENT acts that cause harm. First address whether the acts were INTENTIONAL TORTS and the possible defenses. Then address NEGLIGENCE.<strong></strong></li>
  <li><strong>PRODUCTS LIABILITY –</strong> Strict liability applies to anyone who "releases into the stream of commerce" a defective product causing personal or property injury – not lost profits.<strong></strong></li>
  <li><strong>DEFAMATION AND INVASION OF PRIVACY </strong>–False assertions damage REPUTATION and cause EMBARRASSMENT. TRUTH is a DEFENSE to defamation, but not INVASION.<strong></strong></li>
  <li><strong>NUISANCE</strong> – Interference with the enjoyment and use of public or private LAND.<strong></strong></li>
  <li><strong>MISCELLANEOUS MALICIOUS TORTS -- MALICIOUS PROSECUTION / ABUSE OF PROCESS, INTERFERENCE WITH CONTRACT / INJURIOUS FALSEHOOD, DECEIT</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<strong></strong>
<p><strong>3. ORDER THE ISSUES.</strong> If the CALL of the question does not state and order the issues, you should usually discuss the issues in the ORDER EVENTS TAKE PLACE with the following tips and exceptions:</p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>Discuss INTENTIONAL torts (mnemonic = ABC-FITT) before NEGLIGENCE.</li>
    <li>ALWAYS define INTENTIONAL as part of the rule for the first intentional tort issue discussed.</li>
    <li>If there is any damage to PERSON or PROPERTY, discuss both intentional torts and negligence UNLESS the question CLEARLY says there was <strong>NO INTENTION</strong> to cause damage.</li>
    <li>Say "TORTIOUS ASSAULT" and "TORTIOUS BATTERY" because the definitions are different from "CRIMINAL" assault and battery!</li>
    <li>One intentional tort often raises the issue of another --
        <ul>
          <li>Tortious BATTERY suggests ASSAULT.</li>
          <li>Tortious ASSAULT suggests INTENTIONAL INFLICTION.</li>
          <li>FALSE IMPRISONMENT suggests INTENTIONAL INFLICTION.</li>
          <li>CONVERSION suggests issue of TRESPASS TO CHATTELS.</li>
          <li>DEFAMATION raises an issue of NEGLIGENCE.</li>
          <li>ABUSE OF PROCESS often raises an issue of DEFAMATION.</li>
          <li>MALICIOUS PROSECUTION raises an issue of FALSE IMPRISONMENT and INTENTIONAL INFLICTION.</li>
          <li>DEFAMATION often raises an issue of INVASION OF PRIVACY.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Discuss NEGLIGENCE in almost every essay unless intent is clearly shown.</li>
    <li>Discuss INTENTIONAL INFLICTION and NEGLIGENCE before NEGLIGENT INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS.</li>
    <li>If DEFAMATION issues are raised you will have to define and discuss negligence briefly in order to apply <em>Sullivan v. New York Times</em>, etc.</li>
    <li>Discuss PASSIVE DEFENSES (based on absence of an element of the tort) as part of your analysis of each tort issue itself.</li>
    <li>Discuss AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES (such as self-defense) as separate issues following the intentional tort discussion.</li>
    <li>Discuss the AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES of CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE, COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE and ASSUMPTION OF RISK following almost every negligence analysis.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>For example</strong>, if "Ted dared Bob to throw at him. Bob threw at Ted, missed and hit Henry," the structure of the answer would be:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong><em><u>Ted v. Bob</u></em></strong></p>
    <p><em>1)<u> TORTIOUS ASSAULT?</u></em></p>
    <p><u><em>2) DEFENSE OF CONSENT?</em></u></p>
    <p><strong><u><em>Henry v. Bob</em></u></strong></p>
    <p><u><em>3) TORTIOUS BATTERY?</em></u></p>
    <p><u><em>4) NEGLIGENCE?</em></u></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<strong></strong>
<p><strong>4. PHRASE ISSUES FOR SIMPLE CONCLUSIONS.</strong> Phrase the issue so it can be answered simply. Consider if the defendant "can" be "liable" without concluding that he definitely "is liable." Remember, the defendant almost always <u>can</u> be found liable if the <u>elements</u> of a prima facie case are shown by the facts.</p>
<p>For affirmative defenses ask if the defendant can "raise" the defense, NOT whether the defense will be sufficient. Remember, the defendant can almost always <u>raise</u> a defense if the <u>elements</u> of a prima facie claim are shown.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can state the issue as a single word like "Negligence?", or you can write it out in more detail like "Can Dick be liable for NEGLIGENCE for the injury to Tom?"</li>
</ul>
<strong></strong>
<p><strong>5. STATE THE VICTIM OR OBJECT OF THE CRIME.</strong> If there is more than one tortious act, or more than one possible plaintiff, state the object or plaintiff in the issue statement. </p>
<ul>
  <li>"NEGLIGENCE?" is not as good as "NEGLIGENCE for injury to Tom?"</li>
  <li>"CONVERSION?" is not as good as "CONVERSION of the car?"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. DON'T COMBINE ASSAULT AND BATTERY.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>NEVER ask if the defendant can be liable for "assault and battery".</li>
  <li>Refer to these <u>torts</u> as "tortious assault" and "tortious battery" OR ELSE refer to "Under tort law..." in the definition to distinguish them from "criminal" assault and battery.</li>
</ul>
<strong></strong>
<p><strong>7. AVOID CONCLUDING DEFENDANTS ARE  <u>LIABLE</u></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>AVOID finding the defendant "liable". It blocks you from discussing the defenses.</li>
  <li>Just say the defendant "can (or cannot) be found liable" for a tort. Then you can also argue he could raise an effective defense..</li>
</ul>
<strong></strong>
<p><strong>8. AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES AS SEPARATE ISSUES.</strong> There are two types of defenses, passive and affirmative.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A <u>passive defense</u> is an argument that a necessary element of a tort cannot be proven. This should be analyzed in your analysis of whether the defendant can be found liable at all.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>ALWAYS discuss the <u>passive defenses as part of your analysis</u> of whether the defendant <u>can be liable.</u></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>An <u>affirmative defense</u> is an entirely <u>separate issue</u> that the defendant should be <u>excused</u> from liability.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>ALWAYS discuss <u>affirmative defenses as separate issues</u> AFTER you have concluded the defendant can be liable.</p>
    <p><strong>For example</strong>, if Dick is lost in a snowstorm and breaks into Paul's cabin, the <u>first issue</u> is, "TRESPASS TO LAND?" The <u>second issue</u>, and it is a totally separate issue, is, "Defense of NECESSITY?"</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Examples of proper Tort issues:</strong></p>
<p>I personally like issues spelled out, but some professors do not. I like issues stated as follows: </p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li><em><u>TORTIOUS ASSAULT on B?</u></em></li>
    <li><em><u>TORTIOUS BATTERY on B?</u></em></li>
    <li><em><u>CONVERSION of the car?</u></em></li>
    <li><em><u>FALSE IMPRISONMENT of B?</u></em></li>
    <li><em><u>INTENTIONAL INFLICTION on B?</u></em></li>
    <li><em><u>TRESPASS to B's Land?</u></em></li>
    <li><em><u>TRESPASS to B's Chattel?</u></em></li>
    <li><em><u>Defense of CONSENT?</u></em></li>
    <li><em><u>Defense of NECESSITY?</u></em></li>
    <li><em><u>NEGLIGENCE?</u></em></li>
    <li><em><u>CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE?</u></em></li>
    <li><em><u>DEFAMATION of B?</u></em></li>
    <li><em><u>Defense of TRUTH?</u></em></li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p>If you use a 'one-word' issue statement BE SURE TO MAKE IT CLEAR in your analysis just what you are trying to say. For example, there may be one act in the fact pattern that is an assault and one that is not. So make it clear which act you are concluding to be an assault.</p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.      <u>ASSAULT?</u> </p>
  <p>Under tort law ASSAULT is an <u>intentional act</u> done <u>to cause and that does cause  reasonable apprehension</u> of a battery, a <u>harmful or offensive touching</u> of the person. <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p><strong>[Every “intentional tort” has the element of INTENTIONAL ACT! Always DEFINE “intentional act” in the definition of the FIRST intentional tort issue as follows:]</strong></p>
  <p>An INTENTIONAL ACT is one done for <u>the purpose</u> of causing or <u>with knowledge</u>with reasonable certainty that it <u>will cause the result</u> that produces injury. <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p><strong>[<u>ALWAYS state this in your discussion of the first intentional tort</u>.  For TORTS an act is intentional if it is done for the PURPOSE of producing a RESULT, or if the actors knows that result will almost certainly occur! But the result does not necessarily have to be injury. All that matters is that the result CAUSES injury.]</strong></p>
  <p>Here … because…</p>
  <p>Therefore, the defendant may be liable for tortious assault.  </p>
  <p>2.      <u>BATTERY</u> <u>?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law BATTERY is an intentional act to cause and does cause a touching of the person of the plaintiff resulting in harm or offense to the plaintiff.<strong>  Important!</strong></p>
  <p>Here … because…</p>
  <p>Therefore the defendant may be liable for battery.</p>
  <p>3.      <u>CONVERSION?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law CONVERSION is  an intentional act to cause and that does cause <u>interference</u> with the chattel of the plaintiff resulting in <u>substantial deprivation</u> of possession. The proscribed legal remedy is <u>forced purchase</u> by the defendant, but the plaintiff may “waive the tort” and seek restitution instead<strong>. Important!</strong></p>
  <p>Here … because… Therefore the defendant may be liable for conversion.  </p>
  <p>4.      <u>FALSE IMPRISONMENT?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law FALSE IMPRISONMENT is an intentional act to cause and that does cause the plaintiff to be confined to a defined area without any reasonably apparent means of reasonable exit. Plaintiffs must actually know they are confined, but do not have to know the confinement is illegal.<strong>  Important!</strong></p>
  <p>Here … because… Therefore the defendant may be liable for false imprisonment.  </p>
  <p><strong>MBE on False Imprisonment</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>One night Paul and David were having a heated argument in Paul's office on the 40th floor of an office building. David became angry and left, violently slamming the office door behind him. The force of David's slamming the door caused the lock to jam and Paul was unable to open the door or to leave his office until a locksmith came the next day.<br>
      <br>
    If Paul asserts a claim against David based on false imprisonment, will Paul prevail? &quot;<strong>No, if David did not intend to jam the lock.</strong>&quot;<br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li></li>
  </ol>
  <p>5.      <u>INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law IIED is an <u>intentional, outrageous act</u> by the defendant which causes the plaintiff <u>severe emotional distress</u>. <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p><strong>[Note: Here "intent" may be shown by EITHER the intentional commission of an outrageous act</strong> <strong>, regardless of intent, or by almost any act for the purpose of causing emotional distress. Any act is "outrageous" per se if the actual intent is to cause severe emotional distress. And a lack of intent to cause emotional distress is not a defense if the act itself is outrageous. But in any case the plaintiff must almost always present evidence to show they suffered extreme emotional distress (more than mere embarrassment).]</strong></p>
  <p>Here … because… Therefore the defendant may be liable for intentional infliction. </p>
  <p><strong>MBE on IIED</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Husband and Wife were staying at Motel, which had a large swimming pool. A state statute required that owners of hotel and motel pools must, during the time that the pool was open for use and no lifeguard was present, post in a prominent place by the pool a sign of specified size stating, &quot;Warning - No Lifeguard Present.&quot; Motel did not provide a lifeguard and did not post the required sign.<br>
      <br>
    One afternoon, Wife went sightseeing and Husband remaining at Motel. When Wife returned, she learned that Husband had been seen swimming in the pool and was later found drowned. There were no witnesses to the drowning.<br>
    <br>
    Wife suffered severe emotional shock when she learned of Husband's death and had to be hospitalized, under the care of a physician, for several days.<br>
    <br>
    If Wife asserts a claim for damages against Motel based on her emotional distress, will wife prevail? &quot;<strong>No, because Wife was not present when Husband drowned.</strong>&quot;<br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li>  </li>
  </ol>
  <p>6.      <u>TRESPASS TO LAND</u> <u>?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law TRESPASS TO LAND is an <u>intentional act</u> by the defendant causing an <u>unauthorized entry</u> onto, over, or under the <u>land of the plaintiff</u>. The defendant is liable for nominal damages and all actual damages caused by the entry.</p>
  <p>Here … because…</p>
  <p>Therefore the defendant may be liable for trespass to land.<u>  </u></p>
  <p>7.      <u>TRESPASS TO CHATTELS?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law TRESPASS TO CHATTEL is an <u>intentional act</u> by the defendant causing unauthorized <u>interference with or damage</u> to the <u>chattel of the plaintiff</u>. The defendant is liable for actual damages measured as the lost rental value of the chattel, the rental costs for temporary replacement of the chattel, and the repair costs to repair the chattel, but usually not more than the actual cash value of the chattel.</p>
  <p>Here … because… Therefore the defendant may be liable for trespass to chattels.  </p>
  <p>8.      <u>TRANSFERRED INTENT?</u></p>
  <p>Under the tort doctrine of TRANSFERRED INTENT, a defendant who commits an intentional tort towards anybody generally becomes liable for every injury inflicted on everybody, even if the injury caused or the person caused injury is not the original intent. <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p>An exception is that Courts generally will not find IIED based on transferred intent, and Courts may find only negligence and not an intentional tort by transferred intent if the original intent of the defendant was not malicious<strong>.</strong></p>
  <p>Here … because… Therefore the defendant may be liable for trespass to chattels.  </p>
  <p>9.      <u>DAMAGES for INTENTIONAL TORTS?</u></p>
  <p>Every defendant that commits an intentional tort is liable for all actual damages actually and proximately caused. Damages consist of SPECIAL DAMAGES , compensation for monetary losses, and GENERAL DAMAGES, compensation for pain, suffering, anxiety, emotional distress, inconvenience, etc. Defendants may also be liable for PUNITIVE DAMAGES  if the Court finds they acted with MALICE, an evil or wrongful intent.</p>
  <p>10.  <u>DEFENSE of DISCIPLINE?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law a person with <u>recognized authority</u> (schoolteacher, bus driver, airplane pilot, policeman, parent, etc.) is privileged to <u>act reasonably</u> given the circumstances in a manner that otherwise might constitute a battery or false imprisonment.</p>
  <p>Here…because…Therefore…  </p>
  <p>11.  <u>DEFENSE of AUTHORITY OF LAW (PREVENTION OF CRIME)?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law a person is privileged to <u>act reasonably to prevent or stop</u> a FELONY from being committed <u>in their presence</u>. Police may arrest for misdemeanors committed in their presence and for felonies otherwise if based upon reasonable suspicion.</p>
  <p>Here…because…Therefore…  </p>
  <p>12.  <u>DEFENSE of RECAPTURE?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law a person has a qualified privilege to use <u>reasonable force</u> to <u>RECAPTURE</u> their own chattel if 1) they have <u>asked for</u> and have been <u>refused return</u> of the chattel, and 2) they are in <u>fresh pursuit</u> of wrongfully taken chattel, or 3) they lost possession of the chattel through <u>no fault of their own</u>.</p>
  <p>Here…because…Therefore…  </p>
  <p>13.  <u>DEFENSE of NECESSITY?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law a person is privileged to act <u>reasonably</u> as <u>NECESSARY</u> to protect their own <u>safety,</u> the <u>safety of others</u>, and the <u>safety of property</u>.  For defense of property to be “reasonable” the value of the property being protected must exceed the damages caused by the efforts to protect it. Reasonable acts done to protect the <u>property of others</u> is a PUBLIC NECESSITY and absolutely privileged. Reasonable acts done to protect the <u>defendant’s own property</u> are a PRIVATE NECESSITY and only a qualified privilege. The defendant remains liable for actual damages to the plaintiff.</p>
  <p>Here…because…Therefore…  </p>
  <p>14.  <u>DEFENSE of CONSENT?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law <u>FULLY INFORMED</u> CONSENT from a person with <u>legal capacity</u>is a defense to most intentional torts, but is not a defense to a battery that causes foreseeable great bodily injury.</p>
  <p>Here…because…Therefore…  </p>
  <p>15.  <u>DEFENSE of OTHERS?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law a person is privileged to act <u>reasonably</u> as <u>necessary</u> to <u>defend others</u>  who are NOT AGGRESSORS from harm. Aggressors are people who  have unreasonably created or increased dangers to others. Courts are split when a defendant unknowingly acts to defend an AGGRESSOR. Under one view the defendant STEPS INTO THE SHOES of the aggressor and has no privilege because the aggressor could not claim self-defense.  In other Courts defendants areprivileged to defend aggressors in confrontations if they act with a <u>REASONABLE BELIEF</u> they are acting to defend an innocent victim of aggression.</p>
  <p>Here…because…Therefore…  </p>
  <p><strong>[Note that while very old common law may have held that one is only privileged to protect a family member, that idea was abandoned so long ago it is not worth mentioning.]</strong></p>
  <p>16.  <u>DEFENSE of PROPERTY?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law defendants are privileged to use <u>reasonable force</u> to protect their property or the property of others. The use of deadly force to protect property is never reasonable or legal.</p>
  <p><strong>State something like the following if there is a suspected theft of goods or services:</strong></p>
  <p>Under the SHOPKEEPER’S PRIVILEGE a defendant may use <u>reasonable force</u> to detain a plaintiff for a <u>reasonable period of time</u> to investigate a <u>reasonable suspicion</u> that the plaintiff has stolen goods or services from the defendant.</p>
  <p><strong>State something like the following if there was a tortious injury to the defendant:</strong></p>
  <p>To protect litigation rights defendants may use <u>reasonable force</u> to <u>as necessary</u> to detain plaintiffs for a <u>reasonable period of time</u> to investigate events that have caused them damages.   </p>
  <p>Here…because…Therefore…  </p>
  <p>17.  <u>SELF-DEFENSE?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law a person who is NOT AN AGGRESSOR may act <u>reasonably</u> if <u>NECESSARY</u> to protect <u>their own safety</u> . Modernly the person can “hold her ground” and has is no duty to retreat in most jurisdictions. Aggressors are people who have unreasonably created or increased dangers to others.</p>
  <p>Here…because…Therefore…  </p>
  <p>18.  <u>DEFENSE of INFANCY, INSANITY or INCOMPETENCE?</u></p>
  <p>INFANCY, INSANITY and INCOMPETENCE are not defenses for intentional torts.</p>
  <p><strong>[Watch for intentional torts by children or insane people!  It is a criminal defense but not a tort defense because tort law is to compensate plaintiffs, not punish defendants.]</strong></p>
  <p>29.  <u>RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR</u> <u>?</u></p>
  <p>Under the doctrine of RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR an employer, master or principal is <u>vicariously liable</u> for all torts committed by an employee, servant or agent, respectively, if the tort is <u>committed within the scope</u> of the employment or agency relationship. Respondeat superior does not apply to independent contractors.</p>
  <p>Here…because…Therefore.  </p>
  <p><strong>[This is the same for both intentional torts and negligence]</strong></p>
  <p>30.  <u>VICARIOUS LIABILITY for JOINT ENTERPRISE</u> <u>?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law each member of a JOINT ENTERPRISE is <u>vicariously liable</u> for all torts committed by other members <u>within the scope</u> of the enterprise relationship. A joint enterprise is one in which two or more parties <u>agree to work together</u> for <u>mutual benefit</u> and each shares <u>equal rights of control</u> over the objects and activities that cause the plaintiff injury.</p>
  <p>Here…because…Therefore.  </p>
  <p><strong>[This is the same for both intentional torts and negligence]</strong> </p>
  <p>31.  <u>LIABILITY for acts of INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law defendant who hires an INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR to perform duties that are not “non-delegable” by law is <u>NOT vicariously liable</u> for torts committed by the contractor and can only be <u>directly liable</u> because of <u>negligent selection</u> or <u>negligent entrustment</u> of the contractor by the defendant. An independent contractor is  a person selected to provide labor services <u>without close and regular supervision</u>.</p>
  <p>Here…because…Therefore.  </p>
  <p><strong>[This </strong>is<strong> the same for both intentional torts and negligence. Pay attention to the sort of responsibilities that are non-delegable.]</strong> </p>
  <p>32.  <u>The ACTUAL CAUSE or a SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR causing injury?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law the defendant is the <u>ACTUAL CAUSE</u> of injury if the plaintiff would not have been injured BUT FOR the acts of the defendant. </p>
  <p>If two or more defendants acted negligently, the plaintiff would not have been injured if neither had acted, and the plaintiff cannot reasonably prove she would not have been injured but for the acts of each alone, then each defendant is a SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR  causing injury.  <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p>Here the defendant was the ACTUAL cause of injury (or else a SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR) because …but for…  </p>
  <p><strong>[This is the same for both intentional torts and negligence]</strong></p>
  <p>33.  <u>PROXIMATE CAUSE?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law <u>PROXIMATE CAUSE</u> means that the injury suffered by the plaintiff was so <u>DIRECT, NATURAL and FORESEEABLE</u>, so <u>close in time and place</u>, resulting from a <u>CHAIN OF CAUSATION</u> begun by the defendant’s acts, <u>unbroken by UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENTS</u> that the law will impose liability for the result.  <strong>Important!</strong> </p>
  <p>Generally if <u>two or more events are actual causes</u> of the plaintiff’s injury, the <u>last event</u> will be an UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENT  cutting off the liability of all defendants who acted earlier. However, it is a matter of settled law that <u>negligent acts</u> by others are FORESEEABLE so they can never be intervening events. <u>Acts of nature</u> [e.g. tornados] and <u>criminal or intentionally tortious acts</u> by third parties [e.g. thefts, batteries] are presumed to be UNFORESEEABLE and will terminate defendants’ liability unless extrinsic evidence shows defendants were aware the subsequent events were likely to occur. <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p>Here there was (no) <u>PROXIMATE CAUSATION</u> because…  </p>
  <p><strong>[This is the same for both intentional torts and negligence]</strong></p>
  <p>34.  <u>DAMAGES for TORTS?</u></p>
  <p>Every defendant that commits any tort is liable for all actual damages actually and proximately caused. Damages consist of SPECIAL DAMAGES , compensation for monetary losses, and GENERAL DAMAGES, compensation for  pain, suffering, anxiety, emotional distress, inconvenience, etc. Defendants who commit intentional torts, including gross negligence (<u>deliberate</u> breach of duty) and recklessness (<u>deliberate</u> creation of unreasonable risks) may also be liable for PUNITIVE DAMAGES  if the Court finds they acted with FRAUD, OPPRESSION or MALICE, an evil or wrongful intent to cause harm. Defendants who commit accidentally negligent torts are not liable for punitive damages. Tort plaintiffs have a right to “waive the tort” and demand RESTITUTION instead of compensation for damages.</p>
  <p>35.  <u>EGG</u> <u>SHELL PLAINTIFF?</u></p>
  <p>Under the EGG -SHELL PLAINTIFF concept, defendants are liable for all damages they actually cause plaintiffs, even if the plaintiffs , through no fault of their own, have <u>pre-existing conditions</u>  that make them especially vulnerable to injury. The doctrine of the law is that “defendants must take plaintiffs as they find them.” </p>
  <p>Here…because…Therefore…</p>
  <p>39.  <u>PRODUCTS LIABILITY?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law anyone who RELEASES an <u>UNREASONABLY</u> <u> DANGEROUS</u>product into the STREAM OF COMMERCE is liable for <u>PERSONAL INJURY</u> or<u>PROPERTY DAMAGE</u> <u>CAUSED</u>. A product is UNREASONABLY DANGEROUS ifthe <u>dangers it poses</u> outweigh its <u>utility</u> given the <u>commercial practicality</u> for making it <u>safer, without destroying its utility</u>.</p>
  <p>Liability may be established based on any of four theories: 1) BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY, 2) BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY, 3) NEGLIGENCE or 4) STRICT LIABILITY IN TORT.</p>
  <p>Under a BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY theory the plaintiff must show the defendant sold goods with <u>express representations</u> (express warranty) which made them unreasonably dangerous, and that it was the actual and proximate cause of injury to the plaintiff.</p>
  <p>Further, under a BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY theory the plaintiff must show the defendant sold goods by representing they were <u>safe for ordinary use</u> or <u>knowing the buyer's specific intended use</u> (implied warranty), the goods were unreasonably dangerous for that use, and that it was the actual and proximate cause of injury to the plaintiff.</p>
  <p>Under a NEGLIGENCE theory the defendant has a duty not to place <u>unreasonably dangerous</u> <u>goods into the stream of commerce</u> . The plaintiff must be a <u>foreseeable</u>plaintiff proximately caused injury by the negligent acts of the defendant.</p>
  <p>And, under a STRICT LIABILITY theory the plaintiff must show the seller was a<u>COMMERCIAL SUPPLIER</u>, the product was unreasonably dangerous at the time it left the defendant's control, and the defendant is <u>only liable for non-economic damages</u> .</p>
  <p>Here… because… Therefore …  </p>
  <p>40.  <u>DEFAMATION?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law DEFAMATION is a <u>FALSE</u> statement of material fact <u>PUBLISHED</u>to others <u>about the plaintiff</u> CAUSING <u>DAMAGE</u> to REPUTATION. Defamation may be SLANDER, an oral  statement, or LIBEL, a written  statement. <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p>But many false statements are PRIVILEGED where the defendant speaks to defend a <u>private interest</u>, <u>group interest</u> or <u>the public interest</u>  and does so <u>without malice</u>and in a <u>reasonable manner</u> calculated to defend that interest without unnecessarily harming the plaintiff.</p>
  <p>Injury to reputation will be presumed where there is LIBEL or SLANDER PER SE.  SLANDER PER SE is found where  the false statement alleges <u>CRIMINAL</u>behavior,<u> LOATHSOME</u> disease, <u>UNCHASTE</u> behavior or improper <u>BUSINESS</u>practices. <strong>[CLUB]Important!</strong></p>
  <p>Under <u>NEW</u>  <u>YORK</u> <u>TIMES</u> and its progeny, a <u>PUBLIC FIGURE</u> PLAINTIFF must prove ACTUAL MALICE, that the false statement was made with <u>knowledge</u> or <u>reckless disregard</u> of its falseness, in order to recover in a defamation action. A PUBLIC FIGURE is a person who has acted to <u>put themselves in the public spotlight</u>.  Further, where a matter of <u>PUBLIC CONCERN</u> is at issue, or where the plaintiff seeks punitive damages, the plaintiff must at least prove <u>NEGLIGENCE</u>. <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p>Here the statement was <u>FALSE</u> because … The defendant would dispute this because …</p>
  <p>And the statement was <u>NOT PRIVILEGED</u> because (either no valid interest being protected, statement no made reasonably, or malicious intent)…Further, the statement was <u>PUBLISHED </u>because…Also the statement was <u>ABOUT</u> the plaintiff because … And the statement at issue was <u>DAMAGING</u> to reputation because…</p>
  <p>Therefore, the plaintiff would be able to establish a prima facie case of defamation.</p>
  <p><strong>[Now go through the CASE LAW AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES as part of the defamation analysis. ]</strong></p>
  <p>HOWEVER, the defendant would argue that the plaintiff is a <u>PUBLIC FIGURE</u>because…Therefore, the plaintiff would have to show <u>ACTUAL MALICE</u> because …</p>
  <p>FURTHER, the defendant would argue that the subject was a <u>PUBLIC MATTER</u>because … Therefore, the plaintiff would have to prove <u>NEGLIGENCE</u> because …</p>
  <p>Therefore…  </p>

  <p>44.  <u>PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF PRIVATE FACTS?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law PUBLIC DISCLOSURE is the tort of <u>unreasonably disclosing private facts</u> that a <u>reasonable person would find embarrassing</u>. Here…because…</p>
  <p>HOWEVER, the defendant would DEFEND on the ground the facts revealed were <u>PUBLIC FACTS</u>.  <strong>[This is the main issue in these cases].</strong>  </p>
  <p>45.  <u>PRIVATE NUISANCE?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law PRIVATE NUISANCE is an <u>unreasonable interference</u> with a person’s use and enjoyment of their <u>own land</u>.  In the MAJORITY view COMING TO THE NUISANCE is a consideration for the court and NOT A COMPLETE BAR to bringing a nuisance action.</p>
  <p>Here B’s use of her <u>OWN LAND</u> was <u>INTERFERED</u> WITH by A because…, and the interference was <u>UNREASONABLE</u> because…Therefore, …</p>
  <p>46.  <u>PUBLIC NUISANCE?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law PUBLIC NUISANCE is an<u> unreasonable interference</u> with a person’s use and enjoyment of <u>public resources</u>.  To have standing the plaintiff must show <u>particular injury</u>, greater than that suffered by the general public. Here…because.. Therefore, …</p>

  <p>47.  <u>MALICIOUS PROSECUTION?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law a person is liable for MALICIOUS PROSECUTION if they have <u>instituted</u> or <u>continued</u> a <u>criminal prosecution</u> of another person out of <u>malice</u> and the action was <u>terminated based on its merits</u> because there was <u>no probable cause.</u></p>

  <p>49.  <u>ILLEGAL INTERFERENCE?</u> [Paraphrase as necessary]</p>
  <p>Under tort law a person is liable for <u>unreasonably and illegally interfering</u> with another person’s <u>known or apparent business relationships</u>.</p>
  <p>Here the defendant’s acts caused unreasonable interference because… Therefore,… </p>
  <p>50.  <u>DECEIT (or FRAUD or MISREPRESENTATION)?</u></p>

  <p>51.  <u>NONDISCLOSURE (CONCEALMENT)?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law a prima facie case of NONDISCLOSURE (or CONCEALMENT) requires showing 1) a <u>DUTY</u> to disclose material facts, 2) <u>BREACH</u> of that duty, 3) <u>REASONABLE RELIANCE</u> by the plaintiff on facts as they appeared to be, and 4) <u>INJURY CAUSED</u> by the nondisclosure.</p>
  <p>Here the defendant had a <u>DUTY</u> to disclose because…And the defendant <u>BREACHED</u> that duty because they did not disclose…Further, this was a <u>MATERIAL FACT</u> because…And the plaintiff <u>REASONABLY RELIED</u> on appearances because…This nondisclosure <u>INJURED</u> the plaintiff because…</p>
  <p>Therefore, …  </p>
  <p>52.  <u>TORT RESTITUTION ?</u></p>
  <p>Under tort law plaintiffs may “waive the tort” and instead of seeking an award of damages based on their own injury, they may seek RESTITUTION, an award of damages based on the amount the defendant has wrongfully benefited to PREVENT UNJUST ENRICHMENT.</p>
  <p>Here…because…Therefore…  </p>

  <p><strong>MBE on Torts not covered above:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Husband and Wife were staying at Motel, which had a large swimming pool. A state statute required that owners of hotel and motel pools must, during the time that the pool was open for use and no lifeguard was present, post in a prominent place by the pool a sign of specified size stating, &quot;Warning - No Lifeguard Present.&quot; Motel did not provide a lifeguard and did not post the required sign.<br>
      <br>
    One afternoon, Wife went sightseeing and Husband remaining at Motel. When Wife returned, she learned that Husband had been seen swimming in the pool and was later found drowned. There were no witnesses to the drowning.<br>
    <br>
    Wife suffered severe emotional shock when she learned of Husband's death and had to be hospitalized, under the care of a physician, for several days.<br>
    <br>
    If Wife asserts a claim for damages for the wrongful death of Husband, the basis on which Motel is most likely to prevail is - &quot;<strong>the absence of a warning sign was not a cause-in-fact of Husband's drowning.</strong>&quot;</li>

<p><strong>TORT RULES AND DEFINITIONS (other than for NEGLIGENCE) -</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>ABUSE OF PROCESS (TORTS): </strong>Abuse of process is the tort of bringing or continuing a <u>civil or </u>criminal<u> action</u> against the plaintiff <u>without legitimate basis</u> out of <u>malice</u> or for an <u>improper purpose.</u> (see MALICIOUS PROSECUTION.)</li>
  <li><strong>ACTUAL MALICE (TORTS): </strong>For DEFAMATION a false statement is made with actual malice if it is made with <u>knowledge</u> the statement is false or with <u>reckless disregard</u>  for whether it is false or not. (see RECKLESS, DEFAMATION.)</li>
  <li><strong>APPROPRIATION OF LIKENESS (TORTS): </strong>Appropriation of likeness is the tort of <u>unauthorized use</u> of the <u>name or likeness of a person</u> in a manner that <u>implies endorsement of a product or support of a cause</u>. It does not include the publication  of names and photographs in news articles and matters of legitimate public interest . Damages are often awarded in RESTITUTION measured by the profit to the defendant. (see INVASION OF PRIVACY.)</li>
  <li><strong>ASSAULT (TORTS): </strong>Assault is the tort of <u>intentionally acting</u> to cause the plaintiff <u>reasonable apprehension</u>  of a <u>battery</u>.  The plaintiff must be apprehensive.</li>
  <li><strong>BATTERY (TORTS): </strong>The tort of <u>intentionally acting</u> to cause a <u>harmful or offensive touching</u> of the plaintiff or his person.<strong></strong></li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><strong>BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY</strong> <strong>(TORTS): </strong></strong>Breach of express warranty is a <u>products liability</u> theory claiming 1) a defendant <u>released goods into the stream of commerce</u><u> </u> 2) <u>falsely stating the goods were suitable for a specific use</u> and 3) the r<u>ecipient of the goods reasonably relied</u> on the statements, 4) the goods were <u>unreasonably dangerous</u> for the stated purpose, and it 5) caused <u>injury</u> to the plaintiff. The defendant is liable for all injury, property damage and other harm that is actually caused, subject to general considerations of foreseeability and proximate causation.<strong></strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY (TORTS): </strong>Breach of implied warranty is a <u>products liability</u> theory claiming 1) a defendant <u>released goods into the stream of commerce</u>  2) <u>falsely implying the goods were suitable</u> for 3) <u>ordinary use</u> or 4) <u>the buyer's known intended use</u>, 5) that the <u>recipient of the goods reasonably relied</u> on the defendant's expertise and behavior, 6) the goods were <u>unreasonably dangerous</u> for ordinary use or the recipient's known intended use, and it 7) caused <u>injury</u> to the plaintiff.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>COMING TO THE NUISANCE (TORTS): </strong>"Coming to the nuisance" is a defense argument in a nuisance action that the plaintiff's act of physically moving to a location where a condition existed created the nuisance complained of. Considered a complete bar in a MINORITY view but only considered a factor in determining damages in the MAJORITY AND CALIFORNIA view. (see PRIVATE NUISANCE.)</li>
  <li><strong>CONCEALMENT (TORTS): </strong>Concealment is the tort of 1) <u>intentionally concealing facts</u><u>u </u>with 2) an <u>intent to deceive </u>when there is 3) a <u>pre-existing duty</u> to reveal the facts, the 4) plaintiff <u>reasonably relies</u> on the facts as they appear and 5) is <u>caused injury</u>. The difference between CONCEALMENT and FRAUD is only that the latter requires an <u>intentional misrepresentation</u> while the former requires an <u>intentional breach</u> of the duty to disclose material facts. (see FRAUD as alternative theory.)</li>
  <li><strong>CONSENT DEFENSE (TORTS): </strong>Consent is a defense to most intentional torts if there is <u>informed, voluntary</u> consent by a person with <u>legal capacity</u>. Consent is not a valid defense to an act intended to cause serious bodily injury and often is not a defense to injury suffered from “mutual combat”.</li>
  <li><strong>CONVERSION (TORTS): </strong>Conversion is the tort of <u>substantial interference</u> with <u>personal property</u> (chattel) causing <u>deprivation of possession</u>. The remedy and measure of damages for conversion is the forced sale of the chattel to the defendant.  </li>
  <li><strong>CRIME PREVENTION DEFENSE (</strong><strong>AUTHORITY OF LAW</strong><strong>)</strong><strong> (TORTS): </strong>Crime prevention (also called authority of law) is a tort defense that any person has a right to <u>act reasonably,</u> including to perform an arrest, to prevent a <u>felony in their presence</u>, and that <u>police</u>may arrest to <u>prevent misdemeanors in their presence</u> or based on <u>reasonable suspicion of felonies</u>. (Defense to intentional torts of battery and false imprisonment<strong>.</strong>)</li>
  <li><strong>DAMAGES (TORTS): </strong>It is often said that tort plaintiffs must prove damages, but that is not correct. Under tort law “damages” means a monetary award to a plaintiff that is measured by the <u>injury suffered</u> by the plaintiff. But a tort plaintiff may prove and claim RESTITUTION as an alternative to a proof of damages. Damages may be <u>special</u> (measured by out of pocket expenses) or <u>general</u> (to compensate for pain, suffering.)  Damages may also be claimed for <u>interference with possessory rights</u> in the case of trespass to land and conversion. If a prima facie case  is proven, <u>damages are presumed</u> for the torts of ASSAULT, BATTERY, CONVERSION, FALSE IMPRISONMENT, TRESPASS TO LAND and LIBEL PER SE. Damages <u>must be proven with admissible evidence</u> for the torts of INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, TRESPASS TO CHATTELS, NEGLIGENCE, NEGLIGENT INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, SLANDER, and LIBEL PERQUOD. (which see.) An award of PUNITIVE damages is intended to punish and deter further misconduct by the defendant is not strictly measured by the actual injury to the plaintiff. (See RESTITUTION)</li>
  <li><strong>DEFAMATION (TORTS): </strong>A defamation is an unprivileged, <u>false statement of material fact</u><u>about the plaintiff</u> <u>published</u> to <u>another</u> person <u>causing damage to her reputation</u>. Statements made in a <u>reasonable manner</u>, <u>without malice</u> to <u>defend a legitimate personal, group, or public interest</u>  are PRIVILEGED. An oral defamation is SLANDER and a written defamation is LIBEL. If the defamatory statement involves INNUENDO or interpretation (COLLOQUIUM) or knowledge of extrinsic facts (INDUCEMENT) it is defamation PER QUOD. If the false statement is clear on its face and about <u>criminal</u> acts, <u>loathsome disease</u>, <u>unchaste</u> behavior or <u>business</u> practices of the plaintiff it is defamation PER SE (CLUB). General damages can be awarded without proving special damages only in the case of a <u>defamation per se</u>. Under <em>New York Times v. Sullivan</em> a <u>public figure plaintiff</u>  must prove the defendant acted with <u>actual malice</u> because they <u>acted with knowledge or with reckless disregard</u>  of the falsity of their statements. Further, <u>negligence</u> or <u>actual malice</u> must be proven if the false statements concern a matter of legitimate <u>public interest.</u> 
      <blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li>LIBEL is a DEFAMATION that is <u>written</u> or <u>recorded</u> in some manner giving the false statement permanence. It may be LIBEL PER SE or LIBEL PER QUOD.</li>
          <li>SLANDER is a DEFAMATION that is <u>oral</u> or made in some manner that it is transitory and not permanent. It may be SLANDER PER SE or SLANDER PER QUOD.</li>
          <li>ACTUAL MALICE means making a false statement with <u>knowledge</u> or RECKLESS DISREGARD for its falsity.</li>
          <li>RECKLESS DISREGARD with respect to a claim of ACTUAL MALICE for defamation means the defendant <u>deliberately made a defamatory statement of fact</u> about the plaintiff <u>without any factual basis, whatsoever, to believe it was true</u>.</li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>DEFENSE of OTHERS (TORTS): </strong>A person is privileged to act as reasonably necessary to protect the safety of others. Jurisdictions are split when a defendant mistakenly acts to protect an aggressor in a fight. Under the STEPS-INTO-THE-SHOES view the defendant steps into the shoes of the aggressor and is not privileged to act to defend the aggressor in a fracas. Under the REASONABLE APPEARANCES view the defendant is privileged to act based on reasonable appearances, even if he acts to protect the aggressor in a fracas mistakenly believing he is aiding the victim of aggression. (See AGGRESSOR.)</li>
  <li><strong>DEFENSE of PROPERTY (TORTS): </strong>A person is privileged to act as <u>reasonably necessary</u> to protect his own property or the property of others. But deadly force can never be used to protect property because it is NOT reasonable. Defense of property is never a defense to murder, but a MISTAKE OF FACT may be a reasonable alternative. (see NECESSITY, MISTAKE OF FACT .)</li>
  <li><strong>DISCIPLINE </strong><strong>DEFENSE </strong><strong>(TORTS): </strong>A person of <u>recognized authority</u> (schoolteacher, bus driver, airplane pilot, policeman, parent, etc.) is privileged to <u>act reasonably</u> to control others (Defense to intentional torts of battery and false imprisonment.)</li>
  <li><strong>FALSE IMPRISONMENT (TORTS):</strong> False imprisonment is the tort of <u>intentionally acting</u> to cause the plaintiff to be <u>confined</u> to an enclosed area with <u>no reasonably apparent means of reasonable escape</u>. The plaintiff must be <u>aware</u> of the confinement.</li>
  <li><strong>FALSE LIGHT (TORTS): </strong>False light is the tort <u>publishing</u> a <u>false portrayal</u> of the plaintiff causing <u>inconvenience</u> or <u>embarrassment.</u> Damages are generally measured by the injury to the plaintiff. The distinction between False Light and Defamation is that in the former case the false portrayal may not cause damage to reputation while in the later case false statements of fact cause injury to reputation and standing. (see INVASION OF PRIVACY.)</li>
  <li><strong>FRAUD (TORTS): </strong>Fraud is the tort of 1) FALSELY STATING or MISREPRESENTING material facts with 2) an INTENT TO DECEIVE, causing 3) REASONABLE RELIANCE by the plaintiff 4) resulting in INJURY to the plaintiff. (Also called DECEIT; See CONCEALMENT as alternative theory.)</li>
  <li><strong>INFANCY, INSANITY AND INCOMPETENCE (TORTS): </strong>There is NO DEFENSE of infancy, insanity or incompetence in TORT other than to claim lack of intent!</li>
  <li><strong>INTENTIONAL ACT (TORTS): </strong>An intentional act is one done <u>for the purpose</u> of causing a result or <u>with knowledge</u> with reasonable certainty that <u>the result will occur</u>.</li>
  <li><strong>INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS (TORTS): </strong>Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress is an intentional, <u>outrageous</u> act  which causes the plaintiff <u>severe emotional distress</u> beyond mere embarrassment and humiliation. The plaintiff must prove emotional distress suffered actually was severe, and generally transferred intent will not apply. (See TRANSFERRED INTENT.) </li>
  <li><strong>INTERFERENCE (TORTS): </strong>Interference is the tort of <u>unreasonably interfering</u> with the <u>known</u> business relationships of the plaintiff causing injury. This may be called interference with a "CONTRACT" where the defendant knows the plaintiff has an existing contract, or it may otherwise be called interference with "PROSPECTIVE ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS". </li>
  <li><strong>INTRUSION (TORTS): </strong>Intrusion is an action for INVASION OF PRIVACY caused by <u>unreasonable intrusion</u> into the peace and solitude of the plaintiff. Damages are measured by the injury to the plaintiff. (see INVASION OF PRIVACY.)</li>
  <li><strong>INVASION OF PRIVACY (TORTS): </strong>Invasion of privacy is a general term for four specific causes of action: <u>D</u>ISCLOSURE of private facts, <u>I</u>NTRUSION into solitude, <u>A</u>PPROPRIATION OF LIKENESS, and FALSE <u>L</u>IGHT (DIAL). 
      <blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>DISCLOSURE </strong>OF PRIVATE FACTS is the <u>unreasonable</u> <u>public disclosure</u> of <u>private facts,</u> even though true, that a reasonable person would find <u>embarrassing</u>. Damages are measured by the injury to the plaintiff.</li>
          <li><strong>INTRUSION </strong>is an <u>unreasonable intrusion</u> into the peace and solitude of the plaintiff. Damages are measured by the injury to the plaintiff.</li>
          <li><strong>APPROPRIATION </strong>OF LIKENESS is the <u>unauthorized use</u> of the<u>name or likeness of a person</u> to <u>make a profit</u>, excepting the publication of names and photographs as news articles, information and matters of legitimate public interest. Damages are measured by the profit to the defendant.</li>
          <li><strong>FALSE LIGHT </strong>is the <u>publication</u> to others of a <u>false portrayal</u> of the plaintiff in a manner causing <u>public ridicule</u> or <u>embarrassment.</u>Damages are measured by the injury to the plaintiff.</li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>LIBEL (TORTS): </strong>Libel is a <u>written</u> defamation or one <u>recorded</u> in some manner giving the false statement permanence. May be LIBEL PER SE or LIBEL PER QUOD. (see DEFAMATION.)</li>
  <li><strong>MALICE (TORTS): </strong>Malice in tort is the requisite mental state or wrongful intent required for a defendant to be liable for certain torts such as DEFAMATION, ABUSE OF PROCESS and MALICIOUS PROSECUTION (which see.)</li>
  <li><strong>MALICIOUS PROSECUTION (TORTS):</strong> Malicious prosecution is the tort of <u>instituting</u>and/or <u>continuing</u> a <u>criminal prosecution</u> of the plaintiff out of <u>malice.</u>  The plaintiff must show the prosecution <u>lacked probable cause</u> and was <u>terminated based on its merits</u>. (see ABUSE OF PROCESS.)</li>
  <li><strong>NECESSITY</strong><strong> </strong><strong>DEFENSE </strong><strong>(TORTS): </strong>A person is privileged to <u>act as reasonably necessary</u> to protect people and property from harm. Protection of self is also called SELF-DEFENSE, protection of others is also called DEFENSE OF OTHERS, and protection of property is also called DEFENSE OF PROPERTY. If the act is to protect the safety of any person, it is a complete defense. If it is to protect the property of any person besides the defendant or the public welfare, it is a PUBLIC NECESSITY  and a complete defense. If it is only to protect the property of the defendant it is a PRIVATE NECESSITY  and the defendant remains liable for any damage actually caused.</li>
  <li><strong>NUISANCE (TORTS):</strong>. A nuisance can be a PUBLIC or PRIVATE NUISANCE. A PUBLIC NUISANCE is causing an <u>unreasonable interference</u> with the plaintiff's use of <u>public resources</u> (often land.) To bring an action the plaintiff must prove STANDING by showing they suffer a <u>particular injury</u> from the acts of the defendant that is <u>different</u> from or <u>greater</u> than the injury suffered by the general public. A PRIVATE NUISANCE is causing an <u>unreasonable interference</u> with the plaintiff's <u>use and enjoyment</u> of her <u>own land</u> in a manner that does not constitute a TRESPASS TO LAND (which see.) Nuisance may involve smoke, fumes, odors, noise, light, obstruction or aircraft. In the MAJORITY AND CALIFORNIA view the plaintiffs COMING TO THE NUISANCE (which see) is NOT a complete bar to bringing a nuisance action. (see TRESPASS TO LAND.)</li>
  <li><strong>PRIVATE NUISANCE (TORTS): </strong>A private nuisance is an <u>unreasonable interference</u> with the plaintiff's <u>use and enjoyment</u> of her <u>own land</u> in a manner that does not constitute a TRESPASS TO LAND (which see.)  Nuisance may involve smoke, fumes, odors, noise, light, obstruction or aircraft. In the MAJORITY view the plaintiffs COMING TO THE NUISANCE (which see) is NOT a complete bar to bringing a nuisance action. (see COMING TO THE NUISANCE, PUBLIC NUISANCE, TRESPASS TO LAND .)</li>
  <li><strong>PRODUCTS LIABILITY (TORTS): </strong>Every person who <u>releases</u> an <u>unreasonably dangerous product</u> into the <u>stream of commerce</u>  may be liable for <u>personal injury,</u> <u>property damage</u> and other harm caused.  Liability may be based on four theories: BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY, BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE or STRICT LIABILITY IN TORT (which see.)</li>
  <li><strong>PROXIMATE CAUSE (TORTS): </strong>Proximate (legal) cause means that a defendant’s act actually caused injury that was so <u>direct and natural</u>, <u>close in time and place,</u> by a <u>chain of causation</u>  <u>unbroken by UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENTS</u> that the law will impose liability. But when independent acts by two or more people are all ACTUAL CAUSES of the injury, the <u>last, unforeseeable, intentional act</u> is generally held to be the only proximate (legal) cause of the result and proximate causation and tort liability for all prior acts is terminated. This is the same as for crimes, and it can cut off liability for both intentional torts and negligence.. (see UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENTS.)</li>
  <li><strong>PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF PRIVATE FACTS (TORTS): </strong>Public disclosure of private facts is the INVASION OF PRIVACY tort of <u>unreasonably disclosing private facts,</u> about the plaintiff that a reasonable person would find <u>embarrassing</u>. Damages are usually measured by the injury to the plaintiff. (see INVASION OF PRIVACY.)</li>
  <li><strong>PUBLIC FIGURE (TORTS):</strong> Under <em>New York Times v. Sullivan </em>a public figure for purposes of a defamation action is a person who injects themselves into the public arena. Once a person becomes a public figure they probably remain a public figure until they fade from memory. (see DEFAMATION.)</li>
  <li><strong>PUBLIC NUISANCE (TORTS): </strong>A public nuisance is an <u>unreasonable interference</u> with the plaintiff's use of <u>public resources.</u> To bring an action plaintiffs must prove STANDING (which see) by showing they suffer a <u>particular injury</u> from the acts of the defendant that is <u>different</u>from or <u>greater</u> than the injury suffered by the general public. (see PRIVATE NUISANCE.) </li>
  <li><strong>RECAPTURE OF CHATTELS DEFENSE (TORTS): </strong>Property owners attempting to recover chattel while in <u>fresh pursuit</u> or seeking recovery of <u>chattel lost through no fault of their own</u> may <u>enter land</u> of others and use <u>reasonable force</u> to recover it. They must <u>first request return of the property</u> by the parties in possession if that is feasible. (Defense to trespass to land and battery.)</li>
  <li><strong>RESTITUTION (TORTS): </strong>Restitution is a remedy granted by a court (almost always a money judgment) to the plaintiff that is not measured by the injuries the plaintiff has suffered. Rather it is measured by the amount necessary to prevent UNJUST ENRICHMENT by the defendant, protect the PUBLIC INTEREST by PREVENTING REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS of the plaintiff or otherwise to RESTORE THE STATUS QUO.<strong>  </strong></li>
  <li><strong>SELF-DEFENSE (TORTS): </strong>A person who is <u>not the aggressor</u> in a fracas is privileged to act as <u>reasonably necessary</u> to protect his or her own safety. This is NOT a defense if the party was the <u>aggressor</u> unless they are no longer the aggressor because they <u>attempted withdrawal</u> from the fracas or the other party <u>escalated the level of violence</u>. (see AGGRESSOR, NECESSITY DEFENSE.)</li>
  <li><strong>SLANDER (TORTS): </strong>Slander is an <u>oral</u> defamation or one made in some manner that it is transitory and not permanent. May be SLANDER PER SE or SLANDER PER QUOD. (see DEFAMATION.)</li>
  <li><strong>STANDING (TORTS):</strong> Standing means that a plaintiff has a right to pursue a legal remedy because they have suffered actual damages. </li>
  <li><strong>STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY (TORTS): </strong>Strict product liability is a <u>products liability</u>theory when 1) a <u>commercial supplier</u> of goods 2) releases <u>unreasonably dangerous</u> goods into the stream of commerce , resulting in 3) <u>personal injury or property damage</u> (not economic losses) to the plaintiff. The plaintiff can be <u>any person who is injured</u> as a result. </li>
  <li><strong>TRANSFERRED INTENT (TORTS): </strong>Every defendant that intentionally acts to cause <u>any injury to anyone</u> is liable for <u>every injury to everyone</u> injured, even if the tort plaintiff or injury caused is different from that intended. Transferred intent often is not applied to actions claiming IIED.</li>
  <li><strong>TRESPASS TO </strong><strong>LAND</strong> <strong>(TORTS):</strong> Trespass to land is an intentional act to cause <u>unauthorized entry</u> onto the <u>land</u> of the plaintiff. Trespass may be by <u>physical entry</u> of the <u>defendant</u> herself, or by the defendant <u>causing other people</u>, <u>objects</u> or any <u>particulate matter</u> to enter <u>onto</u>, <u>under</u>or <u>pass over</u> the land of the plaintiff at low altitude. A <u>continuing trespass</u> occurs if the defendant <u>leaves objects</u> on the plaintiff's land. No damage to the land is necessary, but the defendant is liable for any damage caused. It is not a trespass to land for the defendant to cause smoke, fumes, odors, sounds, light, obstruction or objects at high altitude to pass over the land of the plaintiff, but such acts may constitute a PRIVATE NUISANCE (which see.)</li>
  <li><strong>TRESPASS TO CHATTELS (TORTS):</strong> A trespass to chattels is an intentional <u>unauthorized interference</u> with the <u>chattel</u> of <u>another</u> causing <u>damage</u>.</li>
  <li><strong>UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENTS (TORTS):</strong> If a subsequent act by a third party, or natural event (“act of God”) is also an actual cause of the injury suffered by a plaintiff or victim, if will generally be viewed as an “unforeseeable intervening event” that terminates proximate cause and ends the liability of defendants that acted earlier. But negligence by a third party is presumed to be foreseeable and will not terminate proximate causation or liability. Criminal acts and intentional torts by third parties are presumed to be unforeseeable and will terminate all liability of defendants that acted earlier UNLESS the defendant knew the subsequent criminal act or intentional tort by the third party was likely to occur. (see PROXIMATE CAUSE.)</li>
  <li><strong>UNJUST ENRICHMENT (TORTS): </strong>A Court may award a remedy in RESTITUTION (usually a money judgment) to either prevent an unjust enrichment or protect the public interest by preventing the frustration of reasonable commercial expectations rather than a remedy based on damages. (see RESTITUTION). </li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><strong>Negligence</strong></p>
<p>Two types of Negligence Issues</p>
<p>Type 1: Both intentional torts and Negligence: For this type of fact pattern you probably do not have enought time to analyse each element of negligence as a separate issue. Discuss the intentional torts first. Then say the ISSUE is Negligence? and discuss the elements of DUTY, BREACH, CAUSATION and DAMAGES as paragraphs within the negligence issue analysis.</p>
<p>Type 2: Negligence alone. This is full blown analysis of negligence. You must discuss the negligence elementes of DUTY, BREACH, CAUSATION and DAMAGES thoroughly, each as separate issue. </p>

<p><strong>AN ISSUE SPOTTING EXAMPLE:</strong></p>
<blockquote><strong></strong>
    <p><strong>Example 1: </strong><em>"Al went to a deserted farm house to shoot his gun. But Bob the wino had gone to sleep in the house the night before in a drunken stupor. Al didn't think anybody was there because it was a remote spot and no cars were around. He shot out the windows of the old farm house and a bullet hit Bob. What actions can Bob bring against Al, and what are Al's defenses?"</em></p>
  <strong></strong>
  <p><strong>Issues:</strong> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1) BATTERY because Al was <u>intentionally</u> acting to "shoot out the windows" of the house. His intent and act were to commit a trespass to land. It became a battery on Bob by transferred intent. Bob cannot bring an action for trespass to land because it was not his house. </p>
    <p>2) NEGLIGENCE. Did Al have a <u>duty</u> to Bob? Yes, because Al created peril and Bob was within the <u>zone of danger</u> created by Al's act.  Did he <u>breach</u> the duty by not being careful? Yes, because it was unreasonably dangerous to be shooting into a house, even an abandoned one, without looking to see if someone was inside. Was Al the <u>actual</u> cause of Bob's injury? Yes, because Bob would not have been "hit" if Al had not "shot." Was Al the <u>proximate cause</u> of Bob's injury? Yes, because the injury was the <u>direct and natural result</u> of Al's act.</p>
    <p>3) CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE. Clearly Bob helped cause his injury because he went to sleep in a "deserted farm house" in a "drunken stupor". If he had not done that, he would not have been in a dangerous place.</p>
    <p>4) COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE -- same thing.</p>
    <p>5) ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK -- Bob was not <u>aware of risk</u> and did not <u>consciously disregard</u> danger because he was "in a drunken stupor."</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><strong>HOW TO CRAFT NEGLIGENCE ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p> Here are some  pointers: </p>
<p><strong>1. INTRODUCTORY PASSAGE?</strong> If the essay question concerns negligence and nothing but negligence the "overall" issue is negligence but each element of proof (duty, breach, actual cause, proximate cause, damages) become the main issues of discussion. In this case you can start with an <u>introductory passage</u> that defines negligence as the cause of action and then presents these elements of proof as the individual issues. But if there are intentional torts, defamation, nuisance or similar issues presented, negligence is just a single issue and should be addressed as a single issue.</p>
<p><strong>2. CONSIDER NEGLIGENCE PER SE FIRST.</strong> If a plaintiff violated a statute or rule consider getting negligence per se out of the way first. In this case the DUTY is based on statute and the violation is the BREACH. But this makes essay answer too easy (Yikes!) so usually the purpose of the statute is not to protect the plaintiff from the type of injury suffered.</p>
<p><strong>3. IF DUTY IS BASED ON PERIL ALWAYS MENTION PALSGRAF.</strong> The whole point of <em>Palsgraf</em> is DUTY based on peril is only to those with in the "zone of danger" (both Cardozo and Andrews were in agreement on that), but Cardozo thought LIABILITY should only be to those owed a duty while Andrews felt it should extend to those who were injured, even those who were not owed a duty because they were not in the "zone of danger", the same as with the RESCUER DOCTRINE. Your professor may think <em>Palsgraf</em> is about BREACH, but it is not. And she may say Andrews argued "a duty to one is a duty to all", but that is wrong too. But, DO NOT try to correct your professor! Humor her! </p>
<p>To truly understand <em>Palsgraf </em>get Nailing the Bar's "Simple Torts Outline". Bit don't dwell on <em>Palsgraf </em>too much in an exam. That just wastes time. Just say that, </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>"Under <u>Palsgraf</u> Cardozo said that defendants that create peril do not owe a duty to protect those outside the <u>zone of danger</u> created by their acts so they should not be liable to them. But Andrews said <u>defendants who breach</u> duties based on peril <u>should be liable</u> to everyone actually and proximately caused injury, even if they are outside the zone of danger, the same as is true under the Rescuer Doctrine." </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't misspell "Cardozo". It is NOT "Cardoza". Remember <strong>"Cardozo was a Bozo."</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. CONSIDER RES IPSA LOQUITUR</strong> <strong>(RIL). </strong>If there is no witness to <u>the cause</u> of an accident consider RIL as a means of proving BREACH. It creates a <strong>presumption of breach</strong>when there are no actual facts to prove a breach by the defendant. It is a negligence issue and also arises often in product liability when there are no facts to prove if the product was always dangerous or became dangerous because of mishandling while being passed from manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer. Look for vague facts like these</p>
<ul>
  <li>"an accident occurred"</li>
  <li>"a plane crashed in the ocean"</li>
  <li>"the engine malfunctioned"</li>
  <li>"there were no witnesses"</li>
  <li>"everyone was killed"</li>
  <li>"the plaintiff cannot remember the accident"</li>
  <li>"the product was discovered to be defective"</li>
</ul>
<strong></strong>
<p><strong>5. HOW MUCH TIME AND ANALYSIS?</strong> If the negligence issue is combined with some intentional tort issues, spend <u>twice as much time</u> on the negligence issue as on any intentional tort issue. But analyze DUTY, BREACH, ACTUAL and PROXIMATE CAUSE and DAMAGES as elements within your one negligence issue. Be sure to analyze CONTRIBUTORY and COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE as separate issues.</p>
<p>But if the WHOLE question involves NEGLIGENCE and there are no intentional torts, then you should analyze each element of negligence as a separate issue. </p>
<p><strong>6. PHRASE ISSUES FOR NEGLIGENCE AS FOLLOWS:</strong></p>
I like clear issue statements like the following but they are not absolutely necessary:
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li><em><u>NEGLIGENCE for injury to plaintiff?</u></em></li>
    <li><em><u>DUTY?</u></em></li>
    <li><em><u>BREACH?</u></em></li>
    <li><em><u>RES IPSA LOQUITUR?</u></em></li>
    <li><em><u>ACTUAL CAUSE?</u></em></li>
    <li><em><u>PROXIMATE CAUSE?</u></em></li>
    <li><em><u>DAMAGES?</u></em></li>
    <li><em><u>CONTRIBUTORY or COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE?</u></em></li>
    <li><em><u>ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK?</u></em></li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li><span class="style1724"><u> NEGLIGENCE?</u>
    </span><p><em>Under tort law NEGLIGENCE is a failure to  exercise that degree of care that a reasonably prudent person would use in the same situation.  To prevail the plaintiff must usually prove <u>DUTY</u>, <u>BREACH</u>, <u>ACTUAL</u> and <u>PROXIMATE CAUSATION</u> and <u>DAMAGES</u>. <strong>Important!  </strong></em></p>
    <blockquote class="style1738">
      <p>[If this is a 'type 1' negligence question combined with some intentional tort issues at this point you should give a very abbreviated discussion of duty, breach, actual cause, proximate cause and damages, all in one single issue analysis. </p>
      <p>Also, a very short abbreviated definition and analysis of negligence is required in discussing <u>products liability</u> and <u>defamation</u> because each of those fact patterns raise negligence issues.</p>

    </blockquote>
    </li>
  
  <li class="style1739"><u>STRICT LIABILITY?</u>
    <p>Under tort law a defendant that engages in any of three activities is STRICTLY LIABLE  to any person who is actually and proximately caused injury. These three activities are: 1) keeping a KNOWN, DANGEROUS ANIMAL , 2) keeping an EXOTIC ANIMAL  of a type that is not commonly domesticated, or 3) engaging in ULTRA-HAZARDOUS ACTIVITIES  that are unusual, pose extreme risks to others, and are usually subject to strict safety regulations.</p>
    <p>If a defendant engages in these activities duty is presumed, and if anyone is caused injured as a result breach is presumed as well. Here…because…Therefore… </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>[Note: Product liability also can pose strict liability, but that is betteraddressed as part of a product liability analysis, not a “strict liability in negligence” analysis.]  </strong></em></p>
<ol class="style1740">
  <li value="3">
    <p><u>DUTY?</u></p>
  </li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="style1740">
  <p>Under tort law the general rule is that a person <u>has no duty</u> to act to defend others from harm. A DUTY to act to protect others from harm ONLY arises under five scenarios: <strong>[SCRAP]</strong><u>STATUTE</u>, <u>CONTRACT</u>, <u>RELATIONSHIP</u>, <u>ASSUMPTION</u> or where <u>PERIL</u> to the plaintiff is caused by the defendant.<strong>Important! Important in criminal law as well.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>[If a duty based on STATUTE is suggested say the following:]</strong></em></p>
<blockquote class="style1741">
  <p>A defendant that 1) violates a STATUTE or rule causing injury to the plaintiff will be NEGLIGENT PER SE if 2) the statute was <u>intended to protect people like the plaintiff</u> from 3) <u>injuries like those suffered</u>. [Only cite this where relevant.]  </p>
  <p><strong>[If a duty based on PERIL is suggested say the following:]</strong></p>
  <p>Under tort law defendants that create <u>reasonably foreseeable dangers to others</u>have a DUTY based on PERIL to act reasonably to protect others from those dangers.</p>
  <p>In PALSGRAF, CARDOZO argued  that defendants who fail to act reasonably to protect others from the perils they have created should only be liable to plaintiffs who were actually in the <u>ZONE</u> <u>OF DANGER</u> at the time of their breach. The Zone of Danger is the area where the acts of the defendant created reasonably foreseeable dangers to others.</p>
  <p>ANDREWS argued that defendants who fail to act reasonably to protect others from the perils they have created had always been liable to RESCUERS under the RESCUER DOCTRINE , whether they were in the Zone of Danger or not, (because “peril invites rescue”) and the same principal should be applied to all plaintiffs actually and proximately caused injury by the defendants’ breach of duty. <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p>Here the ZONE OF DANGER was…because…</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>[If a duty based on PREMISES LIABILITY say the following:]</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Under tort law an OCCUPIER OF LAND has a duty to both those who come onto the land and to those off the land. This is a form of duty based on RELATIONSHIP.  </p>
  <p>Under the common law an occupier of land had <u>no duty to UNKNOWN TRESPASSERS</u>.</p>
  <p>The occupier had a duty to <u>warn and protect KNOWN TRESPASSERS and LICENSEES from known, hidden dangers and artificial conditions</u>. Licensees are people allowed  onto the land but not for the occupier’s benefit.</p>
  <p>The occupier had a duty to reasonably inspect  the land and <u>warn and protect INVITEES from known, hidden dangers and artificial conditions.</u> Invitees are people invited  or allowed onto the land for the occupier’s benefit.</p>
  <p>Finally the occupier of land had a duty to conduct and control activities on the land with <u>due care</u> <u> to prevent injury to PEOPLE OFF THE LAND</u> .</p>
  <p>Modernly these rigid rules by classification have often been modified by both statute and Court decision to create a <u>balancing test</u> under which the occupier of land has a <u>duty of due care</u> <u> to ALL</u> <u>PEOPLE</u> to act as a reasonable person would in inspecting, maintaining and using his property so that it does pose known dangers to others.</p>
  Here…because….Therefore.
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>[If a duty based on CONTRACT, ASSUMPTION or other RELATIONSHIPS (beside premises liability) the liability of the defendant is usually narrowly limited to only those owed the duty.]</strong></p>

    <p>Under tort law CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE completely  bars a plaintiff from recovery if <u>any negligence</u> by the plaintiff helped cause their injury.

<hr>
<p><strong>NEGLIGENCE RULES AND DEFINITIONS</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>AS</strong><strong>SUMPTION OF THE RISK (TORTS): </strong>Assumption of the risk is a defense to <u>negligence</u>that acts as a complete bar to recovery if plaintiffs 1) <u>put themselves at risk</u>, 2) with <u>full awareness</u> of the risks, and 3) <u>consciously acceptance</u> of the risks.</li>
  <li><strong>AVOIDABLE</strong><strong> INJURY (TORTS): </strong>Under the Avoidable Injury doctrine some Courts in jurisdictions that recognized CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE (which see) as a complete bar to recovery often held that if a plaintiff’s negligence did not help cause an accident and only contributed to the degree of injury, the Court would consider the plaintiff’s acts in allocating damages but would not consider it a total bar to recovery.</li>
  <li><strong>BREACH</strong><strong> (TORTS): </strong>A breach in negligence is a failure by defendant with an existing duty to meet the applicable STANDARD OF CARE  by acting as a reasonable person like the defendant would normally use in the same circumstance. (see STANDARD OF CARE , RESIPSA LOQUITUR.) </li>
  <li><strong>COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE (TORTS): </strong>In the MAJORITY of States plaintiffs in negligence actions will have damage awards <u>proportionately reduced</u> by the amount of their own COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE. Some States completely bar plaintiffs from recovery if they cause <u>over 50 percent</u> of their own injury. Some States also bar plaintiffs from recovery against any defendant <u>less at fault</u> than the plaintiffs. </li>
  <li><strong>CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE (TORTS): </strong>In a MINORITY of States plaintiffs in negligence actions are <u>completely barred</u> from any recovery if their own CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE caused any part of their injury. But many States following this approach will not bar plaintiffs from recovery if the defendant had the LAST CLEAR CHANCE (which see) to avoid the accident. And under the AVOIDABLE INJURY DOCTRINE  (which see) some Courts have allocated damages on comparative negligence principals when the plaintiffs’ negligence did not cause the accident but only caused their injuries to be more severe.</li>
  <li><strong>DUTY</strong><strong> (TORTS): </strong>Generally a person has NO DUTY to act to protect others. But a DUTY may be established by STATUTE, CONTRACT, RELATIONSHIP, ASSUMPTION or creation of PERIL <strong>[SCRAP]</strong>. Violation of a duty created by STATUTE usually gives rise to a claim of NEGLIGENCE PER SE. The duties of occupiers of land are governed by the principles of PREMISES LIABILITY , a form of duty based on RELATIONSHIP. And any person who creates PERIL to others has a duty as discussed by Cardozo and Andrews in PALSGRAF. (See NEGLIGENCE PER SE, PREMISES LIABILITY, PALSGRAF.)</li>
  <li><strong>EGG-SHELL PLAINTIFF (TORTS): </strong>The doctrine that defendants are liable for all injury suffered by plaintiffs who are extraordinarily susceptible to injury <u>through no fault of their own</u> because "the defendant must take his plaintiff as he finds him." This is to be distinguished from the AVOIDABLE INJURY DOCTRINE situation where the plaintiff's own negligence causes them to be "extraordinarily susceptible" to injury. </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong> </strong><strong>FIREMAN’S RULE (TORT):</strong> Under broadly adopted modern statutes defendants who create dangerous situations that cause accidental injury to professional rescuers like firemen are generally not liable to them for negligence under the RESCUER DOCTRINE. These statutes are generally based on the view that professional rescuers both <u>assume the risks</u> of their professions and are <u>compensated for by insurance plans</u> like the “workman’s compensation” program.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>GROSS NEGLIGENCE:</strong> <strong>(TORTS): </strong>The <u>deliberate breach</u> of a pre-existing duty. “Deliberateness” of the breach distinguishes gross negligence  from “ordinary” negligence. If it causes others to be exposed to <u>extreme resulting in harm</u> it may be called <u>criminal negligence</u>  (which see)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>LAST CLEAR CHANCE (TORTS): </strong>The SAVING DOCTRINE in jurisdictions that recognize CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE (which see) as a bar to recovery that even if a plaintiff was negligent, that is not a bar to recovery if the defendant had the LAST CLEAR CHANCE to avoid the accident.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>LANDLORD LIABILITY: </strong>A tenant who rents or leases real property generally assumes all  liability and risks posed by any hazards on the land. Exceptions are that a landlord that leases land to a tenant remains liable for known, hidden dangers that are not revealed to the tenant, at least until the tenant has occupied the land long enough that the dangers should have been discovered. The landlord also has continuing liability for dangers in the common areas under the landlord's control, for conditions the landlord promised to repair and correct at the time of lease, and for any hazards caused by the landlord's negligence prior to or after lease of the property.</li>
  <li><strong>NEGLIGENCE (TORTS): </strong>Negligence is the failure to exercise the degree of care that a reasonably prudent person would use in the same situation. But to prevail in an action for negligence the plaintiff must show the defendant had a DUTY, BREACHED the duty, and that the breach was the ACTUAL and PROXIMATE CAUSE of DAMAGES suffered by the plaintiff (which see).</li>
  <li><strong>NEGLIGENCE IN PRODUCT LIABILITY SITUATIONS (TORTS): </strong>Any person that releases a <u>dangerous product</u> into the stream of commerce creates peril, and that peril charges them with a DUTY to act to protect all foreseeable plaintiffs, those who are in the <u>zone of danger</u> created by their conduct, from that peril. If the product is <u>unreasonably dangerous</u> they have breached their duty and will be liable for all injuries that are actually and proximately caused by the product. (See PRODUCT LIABILITY in the Week 1 area for the other theories upon which a product liability action might be brought.)</li>
  <li><strong>NEGLIGENCE PER SE (TORTS): </strong>If a duty is created by a statute, a defendant who violates the statute is negligent per se and liable to all plaintiffs who are actually and proximately caused injury as a result if the plaintiffs are in the CLASS of people the statute was intended to protect and they are caused the TYPE of injury the statute was intended to prevent. (see DUTY.)</li>
  <li><strong>NEGLIGENT INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS (TORTS): </strong>Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (NIED) is an action by a <u>bystander</u> for <u>severe emotional distress</u> in situations that do not support an action for IIED or a regular negligence action because 1) the plaintiff suffered <u>no physical injury or property damage</u> and either 2) the acts of the defendant were <u>unintentional</u> or 3) the plaintiff only <u>witnessed</u> some other person or thing being injured. To recover under a claim of NIED the plaintiff must establish 1) severe emotional distress by <u>clear and convincing evidence</u>, and some States require <u>physical manifestations</u> of distress. And 2) when the plaintiff is only a bystander or witness to injury suffered by another person a <u>nexus</u>must be proven showing that the plaintiff was close in time, place or relationship to the person or thing injured.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>PALSGRAF (TORTS):</strong> A duty based on PERIL is created whenever the defendant acts in a manner that creates reasonably foreseeable harm to others. Under <em>Palsgraf</em> Cardozo argued that defendants should only be LIABLE to plaintiffs who were in the ZONE OF DANGER created by their acts, because they only owed a duty to due care to those people. The ZONEOF DANGER is the area (in time and place) where the acts of the defendants created <u>reasonably foreseeable danger to others</u>. Andrews argued that if a duty based on PERIL is owed to anyone and breached, defendants should be liable to everyone who is actually and proximately harmed by the breach even if they were not owed a duty of due care originally, the same as with the RESCUER DOCTRINE. (see RESCUER DOCTRINE, ZONE OF DANGER).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>PREMISES LIABILITY</strong> <strong> (TORT):</strong> Premises liability is a form of duty based on RELATIONSHIP. Under the common law an occupier of land had no duty to <u>unknown trespassers</u> , a duty to protect <u>people off the land</u> from hazardous activities on the land, a duty to warn and protect both <u>known trespassers</u> <u> and licensees</u> from known, hidden hazards and activities on the land, and a duty to inspect, warn and protect <u>invitees</u> from hidden hazards and activities on the land. Modernly these categorical distinctions have generally been replaced by a general duty to protect <u>all</u> parties from unreasonably hazardous conditions and activities on the land. (See DUTY.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>PROXIMATE CAUSE (TORTS): </strong>Proximate cause means that a defendant’s act actually caused injury that was so <u>direct and natural</u>, <u>close in time and place,</u> by a <u>chain of causation</u> <u>unbroken by UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENTS</u> that the law will impose liability. (see UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENTS.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>RECKLESSNESS (TORTS):</strong>Recklessness is the <u>deliberate</u> creation of <u>extreme risks</u> to others. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>RES IPSA LOQUITUR (TORTS): </strong>Under RES IPSA LOQUITUR a plaintiff may establish a presumption of breach by the defendant if 1) negligence by someone is implied by the facts, 2) the defendant had substantial control over the situation that caused injury, and 3) the plaintiff had no control over the situation that caused them injury. By proving the elements of RIL the plaintiff may shift the burden of proof to the defendant to prove she did not breach her duty of due care .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> <strong>RESCUER DOCTRINE (TORT): </strong>Under tort law a defendant who creates a perilous situation is liable to all who are accidentally injured coming to the rescue (except for professional rescuers; see the FIREMAN’S RULE) even though the rescuers who are injured are not in the ZONE OF DANGER created by the defendant’s acts or injured by the dangers created.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> <strong>RESTITUTION (TORTS): </strong>Restitution in tort is an award (usually in the form of a money judgment) prevent UNJUST ENRICHMENT, to PROTECT THE PUBLIC INTEREST by PREVENTING FRUSTRATION OF REASONABLE COMMERCIAL EXPECTATIONS, or otherwise to RESTORE THE STATUS QUO.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong> STANDARD OF </strong><strong>CARE</strong> <strong> (TORTS): </strong>Normally the standard of due care  is the level of care a reasonably prudent person would use. If the defendant is a CHILD engaged in <u>childlike activities</u> the standard is the level of care a reasonable child of the same age and experience would use. A child engaged in <u>adult activities</u> is held to an adult standard. For defendants that are (or claim to be) HIGHLY TRAINED or PROFESSIONAL the standard of care is that of a professional with that training. The standard of MEDICAL CARE is the standard in the community (or nation in some jurisdictions). There is not a lowered standard of care for INCOMPETENTS. (see BREACH (TORTS).)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong> STANDING (TORTS):</strong> Standing means that a plaintiff has a right to pursue a legal remedy because they have suffered actual damages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong> STRICT LIABILITY (TORTS): </strong>Defendants are strictly liable for negligence if plaintiffs are caused injury by 1) the keeping of a known dangerous animal (other than normally domesticated farm animals), 2) the keeping of exotic animals (if the injury is of a reasonably foreseeable type), 3) excavating by the defendant that causes a subsidence of the plaintiff’s land, or 4) ultra-hazardous activities. This is a form of NEGLIGENCE action.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> <strong>SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR (TORTS): </strong>The acts of a defendant are a SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR in causing the injuries of a plaintiff if 1) <u>two or more defendants</u> acted negligently, 2) the plaintiff would not have been injured <u>if none of the defendants had acted</u>, and 3) <u>no evidence shows the defendant did not cause the injury</u> to the plaintiff.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>ULTRA-HAZARDOUS ACTIVITIES: </strong>Ultra-hazardous activities are those that are so dangerous they are highly regulated by government agencies and can only be legally engaged in by large companies with highly trained personnel. Examples would be mining, quarries, chemical plants, and nuclear power plants. Activities that average people can engage in without strict government regulation are not ultra-hazardous activities. Examples would be playing with firecrackers and using readily available chemicals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>UNFORESEEABLE</strong><strong> INTERVENING EVENTS (TORTS):</strong> If a subsequent act by a third party, or natural event (“act of God”) is also an actual cause of the injury suffered by a plaintiff or victim, if will generally be viewed as an “unforeseeable intervening event” that terminates proximate cause and ends the liability of defendants that acted earlier. But negligence by a third party is presumed to be foreseeable and will not terminate proximate causation or liability. Criminal acts and intentional torts by third parties are presumed to be unforeseeable and will terminate all liability of defendants that acted earlier UNLESS the defendant knew the subsequent criminal act or intentional tort by the third party was likely to occur. (see PROXIMATE CAUSE.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> <strong>UNJUST ENRICHMENT (TORTS): </strong>A Court may award a remedy (usually a money judgment) in RESTITUTION to prevent an unjust enrichment rather than a remedy based on damages. (see RESTITUTION)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>ZONE </strong><strong><strong></strong>OF DANGER (TORTS):</strong> The zone of danger  is the area where the acts of a defendant cause <u>reasonably foreseeable dangers</u>. (see PALSGRAF.)</p>

    <td valign="top"><p>Lucy owned a rent house. She advertised in the newspaper to find a renter, citing rent of $700 a month. </p>
      <p>Homer saw the ad and called Lucy at 9:00 a.m. Homer said, &ldquo;&quot;I saw your ad and accept your offer! I will be right there to pay you. I have to see the house, but would you consider $550?&rdquo; </p>
      <p>Lucy said, &ldquo;It's a deal. I will rent to you for $550. This is a firm offer.&rdquo; Homer said he would be there in one hour to see the house. </p>
      <p>Homer went 100 miles an hour to see the house, sideswiping Victoria. Victoria crashed and died along with her 7-month fetus. </p>
      <p>At 3:00 p.m. Homer arrived, five hours late, ran up to Lucy and said, &ldquo;I unequivocally accept. Here is my $550.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>Lucy said, &ldquo;I have decided not to rent to you.&rdquo; Discuss the rights of Homer and Lucy's defenses. </p></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>HOMER VS LUCY</p>
      <p>The rights and remedies of the parties depend on whether or not there was a valid contract. A contract is a promise or set of promises the performance of which the law will recognize as a duty and for which the law will provide a remedy. </p>
      <p>1. UCC?</p>
      <p>UCC Article 2 governs contracts for <strong>sale</strong> of GOODS, <strong>movable</strong> things at the time of identification to the contract. Otherwise, only COMMON LAW governs the contract. </p>
      <p>Here the contract does not concern a <strong>sale</strong> of <strong>movable things </strong>because it is for the &quot;rent&quot; of a &quot;house&quot;. </p>
      <p>Therefore, only COMMON LAW principles govern this contract.</p>
      <p>2. Is a WRITING REQUIRED?</p>
      <p>Under the STATUTE OF FRAUDS certain types of contract must be in writing to be enforced. A contract for conveyance of an interest in LAND often requires a writing, but not leaseholds of a year or less.</p>
      <p>Here the question involves conveyance of an interest in land because the alleged agreement was to rent a &quot;house&quot;, but this appears to be a month-month rental.</p>
      <p>Therefore, a writing would not generally be required. </p>
      <p>3. Was the ADVERTISEMENT an OFFER?</p>
      <p>Under contract law an OFFER is a <strong>manifestation of present intent </strong>to enter into a bargain <strong>communicated</strong> to the offeree and sufficiently specific that an observer would reasonably believe assent would form a bargain. Advertisements are generally not offers because they usually fail to identity the parties or the quantity being offered. </p>
      <p>Here the advertisement was <strong>not specific</strong> as to the parties because it did not guarantee that Lucy would rent to the first person to respond. </p>
      <p>Therefore, the advertisement was not an offer. </p>
      <p>4. Was the 9:00 statement by Homer an OFFER?</p>
      <p>Offer is defined supra</p>
      <p>Here the statement by Homer did not appear to <strong>manifest intent</strong> to enter into a bargain because  even though he said, &quot;I accept&quot; he added that he &quot;had to see the house first&quot;. No reasonable person would believe assent to that statement would form a bargain because it was clear he wanted to &quot;see the house first&quot;. </p>
      <p>Therefore the statement was not an offer. </p>
      <p>5. Was the 9.00 response by Lucy an OFFER?</p>
      <p>Offer is defined supra</p>
      <p>Here the statement by Lucy did  manifest intent to enter into a bargain because she said &quot;It's a deal, I will rent to you for $550.&quot; A reaonable person would believe assent to that statment  would form a bargain.</p>
      <p>Therefore that statement was an offer.</p>
      <p>6. Did Homer have a valid OPTION?</p>
      <p>Offer is defined supra. Under common law an OPTION is a contractual agreement that an offeror will not revoke an offer for a specific period of time <strong>in exchange for CONSIDERATION from the offeree</strong>. CONSIDERATION is an <strong>exchange</strong> of promises posing <strong>legal detriment</strong> such that the law deems it sufficient to support an agreement. </p>
      <p>Here Lucy promised to give a &quot;firm offer&quot;, but Homer <strong>gave no promise or value in exchange</strong>. While the UCC provides for &quot;firm offers&quot; from merchants, the UCC does not govern here. Therefore, Lucy received no legal consideration in exchange for her promise to give a &quot;firm offer&quot; and her promise cannot be enforced against her as an option contract.</p>
      <p>Therefore, Lucy's offer did not create an option contract, and she could revoke her offer at any time.</p>
      <p>7. Did Homer effectively ACCEPT at 3.00?</p>
      <p>At common law an acceptance must be an<strong> unequivocal assent </strong>to the <strong>terms</strong> of an offer, dispatched to the offeror in the manner required, or if no manner is required in the offer, by the means by which the offer <strong>was dispatched</strong> or some <strong>faster</strong> means. An offer must be accepted before it <strong>LAPSES</strong>. Unless there is an option, an offer lapses in the time stated or if no <strong>time stated</strong> within a <strong>reasonable time </strong>after the offer is made. </p>
      <p>Here the reasonable time for acceptance of Lucy's offer is defined by the understanding that Homer would view the house in only one hour at &quot;10:00&quot;. That understanding established the &quot;reasonable time&quot; within which Homer could accept the offer. But Homer was &quot;five hours late,&quot; as Lucy's offer had already lapsed when he arrived. Homer's attempt to unequivocally accept Lucy's 9:00 offer by saying &quot;I unequivocally accept&quot; was ineffective because he could not accept an offer that had already lapsed.</p>
    <p>Therefore, Homer's attempt to accept was ineffective. </p></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>[Explanation: This question is a typical FORMATION question because it goes through a series of communications between the parties. When you see messages going back and forth, it is a FORMATION question, so analyze each message.</p>
      <p>Start with an INTRODUCTORY DEFINITION of a contract. Then chronologically analyze each communication to see if it is an OFFER. Once there is an offer, the next issue is whether the offer is ACCEPTED.</p>
      <p>If there is offer and an acceptance a contract forms and the next issue is the TERMS of the contract.</p>
    <p>After the contract terms are discussed the next issue is whether there has been a BREACH. And if there is a berach, the issues are WHO BREACHED and the REMEDIES of the parties.] </p></td>

      <p>Under the UCC MERCHANTS are people who <strong>deal</strong> in the goods or hold themselves out by occupation as <strong>knowledgeable</strong> about the goods in a contract.</p>
      <p>Here Bob <strong>deals</strong> in tuxedos because he has a clothing store. Al may have &quot;bought a lot of clothes&quot; but there is no evidence he deals in tuxedos or hold himself out by occupation as being particularly knowledgeable about them.</p>
      <p>Therefore Bob is a merchant and Al is not.</p>
      <p>3. Is a WRITING NEEDED?</p>
      <p>Under UCC 2-201 a contract for the <strong>sale</strong> of GOODS <strong>over $500</strong> requires a writing. This limit is being raised to $5,000 but many States are still using the $500 limit. Under the UCC a contract between MERCHANTS may satisfy the need for a writing against both parties if there is a <strong>sales confirmation</strong> indicating the quantity sent to one party by the other and the receiving party <strong>does not object </strong>to the representation of a contract.</p>
      <p>Further, under the UCC there is no need for a writing if goods are <strong>custom made</strong>, the person to be bound <strong>acknowledges the contract </strong>in a legal setting or where a party has <strong>accepted payment or goods</strong>.</p>
      <p>Here the goods are over $500 because the tuxedo costs &quot;$519.95&quot; and Al is not a merchant as shown above.</p>
      <p>Further, this was a &quot;ready-made&quot; tuxedo, not custom made, and Al never acknowledged the contract in a legal setting or accepted the goods.</p>
    <p>Therefore a writing signed by Al is needed if the contract is to be enforced against him by Bob.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>under construction..... </p></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>[Explanation: This is a UCC question, obviously. Bob breached by delivering non-conforming goods that failed to provide a perfect fit, as promised. But he has time to cure, and gave notice he intended to cure.</p>
      <p>If Al wants out of the deal, he can claim a lack of writing. He can do that because he is not a merchant, and the &quot;sale confirmation&quot; does not apply to him. He would be a merchant if he were a collector or hobbyist. But just buying lots of clothes doesn't make him a merchant any more than you are a merchant because you have bought a lot of groceries.</p>
    <p>And Al also possibly can claim frustration of purpose.] </p></td>

    <td valign="top"><p>Groucho entered into a contract with new car dealer Harpo to buy a new Dodge for his brother Chico on his birthday. The agreed sales price was $25,000. Harpo promised the new car would be delivered by Chico's birthday within two weeks. Chico was ecstatic. Groucho made a down payment of $2,000 and promised to pay an additional amount of $23,000 for the car over a five- year period. </p>
        <p>Harpo made a deal with another dealer, Swifty. Swifty agreed to deliver a Dodge of the type specified on time for Chico's birthday in exchange for an immediate payment of $20,000. </p>
      <p>Swifty became insolvent, its inventory was seized and it did not deliver the Dodge. Harpo blames Swifty.<br/>
        Chico was upset he didn't get the car he expected.<br/>
        What are the rights, remedies and defenses of Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Swifty? </p></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>The rights and remedies of the parties here depend on whether there was a valid contract. A CONTRACT is a promise or set of promises the performance of which the law will recognize as a duty and for the breach of which the law will provide a remedy.</p>
        <p>1. UCC?</p>
      <p>UCC Article 2 governs the contracts for the <strong>sale</strong> of GOODS, <strong>movable</strong> things at the time of identification to the contract.</p>
      <p>Here the question involves a <strong>sale</strong> of a &quot;car&quot; and it is <strong>movable</strong> because it was to be delivered.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the UCC applies here. </p>
      <p><strong>GROUCHO v. HARPO</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2. Groucho's rights under a THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY CONTRACT?</strong><br>
            <br>
        Under contract law a THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY CONTRACT is one with main <strong>purpose</strong> of providing a <strong>benefit to a thrid party</strong>. The contract can be enforced by the original party, the promisee, or by a vested intended beneficiary. <br>
        <br>
        A beneficiary may be a DONEE (of a gift) or a CREDITOR (payment of debt) beneficiary. The beneficiary <strong>vests</strong> upon becoming aware of and changing position in reliance on the contract. <br>
        <br>
        Here the <strong>purpose</strong> of the contract is to <strong>benefit</strong> Chico because he was to get a &quot;new Dodge&quot; as a &quot;birthday present.&quot; Therefore this is a third-party benefit contract. Chico is intended DONEE beneficiary because it is a &quot;birthday present&quot;.<br>
        <br>
        Groucho is the promisee because Harpo promised to &quot;deliver&quot; the car in &quot;two weeks&quot;. Harpo is the <strong>promisor</strong> because he has promised to deliver the car to Chico. <br>
        <br>
        Therefore, this is a third-party beneficiary contract, and Groucho as promisee can enforce it. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>3. Groucho's REMEDIES?</strong><br>
        <br>
        Under the PERFECT TENDER RULE of the UCC a non-breaching buyer in a non-delivery situation can demand conforming goods, repudiate the contract or by goods to cover and demand the excess of the cover price over the contract price. <br>
        <br>
        Here Harpo has breached because he did not deliver the promised car.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, Groucho can demand delivery from Harpo or repudiate the contract and demand return of his $2,000. If he covers by buying the car elsewhere he can demand the excess of his cover price, if any, over the contract price. </p>
      <p><strong>GROUCHO V. SWIFTY</strong></p>
      <p><strong>4. Groucho's rights under the DELEGATION contract?</strong><br>
        Under contract law, a DELEGATION is a second contract conveying the duty of performance under the first contract from the original promisor to a delegatee. The promisor in the first contract retains primary liability to the promisee.
        The delegatee assumes secondary liability to the promisee of the first contract if she expressly accepts the delegation in exchange for consideration, a bargained for exchange of value creating legal liability. In the delegation contract between the promisor / delegator and the delegatee the original promisee is a CREDITOR third-party beneficiary with standing to enforce the contract.<br>
          <br>
        A delegatee can raise all defenses that are available to the promisee in the original contract.<br>
        <br>
        Here there is a delegation contract between Harpo and Swifty supported by consideration because Swifty expressly accepted the duty by saying he &quot;agreed to deliver&quot; in exchange for an &quot;immediate payment of $20,000&quot;.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, Groucho has standing to enforce Swifty's promise to deliver the car as a creditor third party beneficiary.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>5. Groucho's REMEDIES against Swifty?</strong><br>
        A promisee under a contract can enforce the delegation contract as an intended third-party beneficiary in the same way as the original promisee of the delegation agreement (Harpo).<br>
        <br>
        Here Gruocho's remedies against Swifty are the same as his remedies against Harpo, and Groucho can recover from Swifty any amounts he cannot recover from Harpo. </p>
      <p><strong>HARPO V. SWIFTY</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6. Harpo's rights under the DELEGATION contract?</strong><br>
        Delegation is defined above.<br>
        <br>
        Here the delegation from Harpo to Swifty is a contract between them because Swifty promised &quot;to deliver the car&quot;, and it is a legal contract supported by consideration because Swifty received an &quot;immediate payment of &quot;$20,000&quot;. Swifty was the promisor and Harp the promisee.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, Harpo can enforce his contract with Swifty and seek recovery from Swifty for any damages due Groucho and / or Chico. </p>
      <p><strong>CHICO V. HARPO</strong></p>
      <p><strong>7. Chico's rights as a THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY?</strong><br>
        <br>
        Third party beneficiary contracts are defined above. Chico is an intended third-party beneficiary because the known purpose of the original contract was to give him a &quot;birthday present&quot;. He vested when he became aware of the original contract and changed position in reliance.<br>
        <br>
        A vested third-party beneficiary can enforce the contract against the promisor in the same manner as the promisee.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, Chico can enforce the original contract against Harpo in the same manner and extent as Groucho.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>8. Chico's REMEDIES</strong><br>
          <br>
        Chico's remedies would be the same as Groucho. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>CHICO V. SWIFTY</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>9. Chico's rights and remedies against Swifty?</strong><br>
        <br>
        Since Swifty agreed to perform the duties of Harpo, Swifty assumed the same liability as Harpo. And since Chico has the same enforcement rights as Groucho, Chico's rights and remedies to enforce the contract against Swifty are the same as against Harpo. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>CHICO V. GROUCHO</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>10. Chico's rights and remedies against Groucho?</strong><br>
          <br>
        A donee beneficiary cannot enforce the promise of a gift against the promisee at law and can only enforce at equity based on promissory estoppel.<br>
        <br>
        Here Groucho entered into the contract with Harpo to give Chico a GIFT, so Chico was a DONEE beneficiary. Where there is no evidence Groucho has breached the contract with Harpo, and even if he did Chico would have no right to enforce the contract against Groucho at law.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, if Groucho had refused to perform the contract (e.g. had refused to make the car payments) Chico could only plead equity against Groucho based on principals of promissory estoppel.

    <td valign="top"><p>When Al was in high school he wrote and copyrighted a rap song called &quot;Dumb and Dead.&quot; He submitted his song to talent agent Tom. On January 1, two days before his seventeenth birthday, he and Tom reached a valid oral agreement that Tom could have exclusive recording rights until Al was 18 years old. Tom was to receive 25 percent of &quot;sales.&quot; </p>
      <p>Tom sent Al a signed, written &quot;sales confirmation&quot; of their agreement that gave all of the details of the agreement. The memo pointed out that records are &quot;goods&quot; under the UCC. After this Al performed completely under the terms of the agreement. </p>
      <p>Tom pitched Al's song to Deccra Records telling them Al was 19 years old, an adult. Following negotiations by Tom, Deccra and Al signed a written agreement on March 1 that Al would receive 50 percent of gross record sales over the next three years. Deccra was aware that Tom would receive a portion of this money under his contract with Al. </p>
      <p>Before Deccra paid anything it discovered Al was only 17. A Deccra executive secretly met with Al and told him the company would not stand by its first agreement, and an alternative agreement was proposed that would benefit both parties. Al agreed on April 1 to a new arrangement under which he got 40 percent of gross record sales, Deccra got 60 percent and Tom was cut completely out. </p>
      <p>The song went straight to the top of the charts and Deccra's sales were $1.6 million in the next year. Of this amount Deccra paid Al $640,000, 40 percent of gross sales. Deccra's distribution expenses were $360,000, and it made profits of $600,000. Tom got nothing. </p>
      <p>Tom got a lawyer and sued both Al and Deccra. </p>
      <p>Al also went to a lawyer. Six months after becoming an adult on his eighteenth birthday he sued Deccra claiming he was a minor when the contract was signed. He demanded return of all remaining revenues, $960,000. </p>
