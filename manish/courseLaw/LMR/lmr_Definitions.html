<p><strong>Types of Contracts</strong></p>
<p>After above discussion, try to find out the type of contract question, there are 6 types of contract questions and / or mixes of all 6 types</p>
<p><strong>Type 1: Formation of Contracts - Questions?</strong></p>
<p>If questions says, a valid contract is formed, then don't discuss formation of contract.</p>
<p><strong>Raise issues of whether contract ever formed at all.</strong><br>
  Was there an OFFER?<br>
  ACCEPTANCE?<br>
  Manifestation of INTENT?<br>
  Was the contract for a LEGAL PURPOSE?<br>
  Supported by CONSIDERATION?<br>
  Between parties with LEGAL Capacity?</p>
<p>For formation of contract, go through each communication between the parties one by one addressing these issues in this order.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Was there a valid OFFER?
    <ol>
        <li>Was there manifestation of INTENT?</li>
      <li>Not effectively REVOKED?</li>
      <li>A GENERAL offer?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Was there an ACCEPTANCE of an offer?
    <ol>
        <li>Not REJECTED by offeree?</li>
      <li>A TIMELY acceptance?</li>
      <li>MIRROR IMAGE RULE (CL) ?</li>
      <li>Accepted by SHIPMENT (UCC) ?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What were the TERMS of the contract?
    <ol>
        <li>Is it <strong>unequivocally clear</strong> the offer is for a UNILATERAL contact?</li>
      <li>Certain as to TERMS?</li>
      <li>A DIVISIBILE contract (UCC) ?</li>
      <li>A PRODUCTION or REQUIREMENTS contract (UCC) ?</li>
      <li>Is <strong>timely performance </strong>an express condition or mere covenant?</li>
      <li>Is <strong>personal satisfaction</strong> an express condition or is there just a promise to render <strong>reasonably satisfactory</strong> performance (an implied condition of every contract) ?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Supported by CONSIDERATION? (Watch for MODIFICATION and ILLUSIONARY PROMISE problems)</li>
  <li>Was the contract for a LEGAL PURPOSE? (Omit if not an issue)</li>
  <li>Between parties with LEGAL CAPACITY? (Watch for MINORS)</li>
</ol>
<p>Follow this pattern:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First look at each communication <strong>chronologically</strong> as a <strong>separate issue</strong> to see if it is an <strong>offer</strong>.</li>
  <li>Second, after you find an offer, examine each following communication as a separate issue looking for an acceptance. It often is a rejection and counter-offer.</li>
  <li>Watch out for and apply the mailbox rules to revocations and rejections by mail/fax.</li>
  <li>When you get a valid acceptance to a valid offer, BINGO !, you have a contract. So the <strong>very next single issue</strong> is to determine its <strong>terms</strong>.</li>
  <li>Don't discuss consideration, legal purpose or legal capacity of the parties <strong>unless the facts call for discussion</strong>.
    <ol>
        <li>Remember that consideration is a <strong>bargained for exchange</strong>.</li>
      <li>No <strong>moral obligation</strong></li>
      <li>No <strong>prior consideration</strong></li>
      <li>No promise qualified by a <strong>future decision</strong> to perform.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Type 2: Term Disputes</strong></p>
<p><strong>What were the terms of the contract?</strong><br>
  Sufficiently CERTAIN that a court can enforce?<br>
  Was there a MODIFICATION supported by consideration?<br>
  Is a term or promised performance a MATERIAL CONDITION?<br>
  Is a given term or promise INCLUDED or EXCLUDED from the agreement?</p>
<p>These raise the questions &quot;What were the terms of the contract?&quot; If FORMATION is in doubt, then the TERMS are probably in dispute as well. Look at the total communication and course of dealing between the parties and address these issues:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Was the agreement CERTAIN that a court can enforce it?
    <ol>
        <li>Remember for UCC only the quantity and parties must be certain.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, were the subject matter, time, price, quantity and parties certain?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Was there a MODIFICATION that was ineffective because unsupported by consideration? Remember this does not apply the UCC question!</li>
  <li>Does the PAROLE EVIDENCE RULE exclude extrinsic evidence? (Remember the mnemonic DAM FOIL!)</li>
</ol>
<p>There are <strong>three situations </strong>where the parties dispute the terms. Usually this is <strong>only one issue </strong>and it will be one of the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Is the contract<strong> too uncertain</strong> to be enforced?
    <ol>
        <li>No quantity stated? (Not a UCC <strong>requirements</strong> or <strong>production</strong> contract)</li>
      <li>Parties uncertain?</li>
      <li>Uncertain as to time, price, subject matter? (Not UCC where <strong>gap fillers</strong> apply)<br>
            <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Is the <strong>modification</strong> supported by adequate consideration?
    <ol>
        <li>Prior Obligation?</li>
      <li>This does not apply to UCC where no considerations is needed?<br>
            <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Does the <strong>parole evidence rule</strong> bar extrinsic evidence of additional terms?
    <ol>
        <li>Merger clause?</li>
      <li>Contract complete within the four corners of the document?</li>
      <li>Remember the <strong>exceptions</strong> (mnemonic = DAM FOIL)<br>
            <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Was <strong>time performance</strong> an EXPRESS CONDITION (material condition) or just a COVENANT (not a material condition)?</li>
  <li>Was <strong>personal satisfaction</strong> an EXPRESS CONDITION (a material condition that the buyer must actually be satisfied) or just a COVENANT (an expression of the implied condition inherent in all contracts that performance must be &quot;reasonably satisfactory&quot;)?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Type 3: Anticipatory Breach Questions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Focus on the issue of who breached first?</strong><br>
  Anticipatory Breach?<br>
  Major or Minor Breach?<br>
  Waiver?</p>
<p>These raise the questions, &quot;Who breached first?&quot; There are two kinds of breach, either <strong>breaches in fact</strong> or <strong>anticipatory repudiation</strong>. </p>
<p>A breach in fact means that <strong>party did not perform</strong> at the time they were supposed to perform.</p>
<p>An anticipatory repudiation means that a party <strong>clearly</strong> states an <strong>intent or inability</strong> to perform at some time in the <strong>future</strong>.</p>
<p>For anticipatory breach questions <strong>look at each communication</strong> between the parties one by one until you find the <strong>first clear breach</strong>. Remember, only one party can breach a contract at a time. Once the first party breaches, the other party CANNOT breach unless the contract is &quot;reformed&quot; by waiver or accord of a good faith dispute.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Was there an ANTICIPATORY REPUDIATION - a clear statement of intent not to perform a future obligation?</li>
  <li>Was there a WAIVER of the anticipatory breach?</li>
  <li>Was there an ACCORD AND SATISFACTION of a good faith dispute?</li>
  <li>Was timely performance an express condition or mere covenant?</li>
  <li>Was personal satisfaction an express condition or is there just a promise to render reasonably satisfactory performance (an implied condition of every contract)?</li>
</ol>
<p>These situations are where one party says, &quot;I don't think I can meet the deadline.&quot; Then the other party says, &quot;Oh yeah? Well then the deal's off. Follow this pattern:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Look at each communication as a <strong>separate issue</strong> to see if it is a <strong>clear statement of intent not to perform at a future time</strong>. If a party says they don't think they will be able to perform in the future, that is expression of a <strong>doubt</strong> and not an expression of an <strong>intent</strong>.</li>
  <li>The<strong> first party</strong> to clearly state an intent to not perform is the breaching party.</li>
  <li>When a party breaches the next issue is the effect of the anticipatory breach. 1) <strong>excuses</strong> the non breaching party from performance and it 2) <strong>accelerates</strong> the performance obligation of the breaching party.</li>
  <li>The <strong>next issue </strong>is whether the non-breaching party <strong>waives the breach</strong> by allowing the breaching party to continue performance under the contract.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Type 4: Defense Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Focus on defense issues:</strong><br>
  Statute of Frauds issue?<br>
  Lack of consideration?<br>
  Illegal purpose?<br>
  Rights of underage party?<br>
  Fraud? Duress?</p>
<p>These raise the following issues:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Does the STATUTE OF FRAUDS (OR UCC 2 - 201 in the case of a sale of goods) require writings?
    <ol>
        <li>Was the need for writing satisfied?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Did the contract (or modification if not a UCC question) lack CONSIDERATION?</li>
  <li>Was the contract for an ILLEGAL purpose (or unconscionable / adhesion contract) ?</li>
  <li>Was the contract voidable by a MINOR or other party lacking capacity?</li>
  <li>Was the contract void because it was the product of FRAUD or DURESS?</li>
  <li>Was the contract void because of MUTUAL MISTAKE?</li>
  <li>Was the contract void because of performance was IMPOSSIBLE or FRUSTRATION OF PURPOSE?</li>
</ol>
<p>If there is a breach, go through each of the breaching party's defenses as separate issues:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First, was there an<strong> insufficient writing</strong> to satisffy the Statute of Frauds?</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of consideration</strong>? Prior obligation? Moral obligation? Prior consideration? Gift promise?</li>
  <li>Illegal purpose? Does <strong>in pare delicto</strong> apply?</li>
  <li>Breaching party a <strong>minor</strong> or <strong>incapacitated</strong>? But, did they repudiate within time after removal of incapacity?</li>
  <li>Contract induced by <strong>fraud</strong>, <strong>duress</strong>, or because of <strong>mistake</strong>? Did the non-breaching party know, or should they have known that the other party was mistaken?</li>
  <li><strong>Performance impossible</strong> or <strong>purpose frustrated</strong>? Was it absolutely impossible? These situations violate IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITIONS of the contract, causing it to fail.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Type 5: Third Party Questions</strong></p>
<p>These raise the question, &quot;Who has the right to enforce?&quot;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Were there THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES?</li>
  <li>Was there a VALID ASSIGNMENT?</li>
  <li>Was there a VALID DELEGATION?</li>
</ol>
<p>These are similar to defenses, and the isuses raised are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Does the third party have standing to braing an action? Intended beneficiary?</li>
  <li>Was there an improper assignment of the contract? Notice not given?</li>
  <li>Was there an improper delegation of the contract? Personal services?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Type 6: Remedy Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Raise issues of what each party can recover and how.</strong><br>
  Specific Performance<br>
  Restitution (quantum meruit concepts)?<br>
  Right to Cure?<br>
  Cover?<br>
  Failure to Mitigate?<br>
  Estoppel?<br>
  Saving Doctrines?</p>
<p>These raise the question, &quot;What remedy does each party have?&quot; </p>
<ol>
  <li>Does a party get time to CURE (UCC)?</li>
  <li>What are the UCC remedies (COVER, REJECT, etc)?</li>
  <li>Did the non-breaching party FAIL TO MITIGATE damages?</li>
  <li>Was there SUBSTANTIAL PERFORMANCE (a MINOR breach) or MAJOR breach?</li>
  <li>Can a party obtain SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE?</li>
  <li>Can the non breaching party get CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (LOST PROFITS)?
    <ol>
        <li>Cite Hadley v. Baxendale</li>
      <li>Remember the mnemonic CCCC.</li>
      <li>Were lost profits <strong>Contemplated</strong> by the parties at time of execuation?</li>
      <li>Were lost profits <strong>Caused</strong> by the breach?</li>
      <li>Were lost profits <strong>Certain</strong> as to amounts?</li>
      <li>Was the lost profits something that <strong>Couldn't</strong> be avoided.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Do the SAVING DOCTRINES of the unilateral contract apply?</li>
  <li>If there is NO VALID ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT can the parties obtain EQUITABLE RELIEF?</li>
  <li>Can promises be enforced based on ESTOPPEL?</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of the remedies is a separtate issue. Only discuss the issues that apply.</p>
<ol>
  <li>If there was a valid contract, was there <strong>substantial performance</strong>? Benefit of bargain.</li>
  <li>Can the plaintiff obtain <strong>specific performance</strong>? Unique goods?</li>
  <li>Can the contract be enforced based on <strong>promissory estoppel</strong>? Injustice resulting?</li>
  <li>Can the party obtain <strong>rescission</strong> and <strong>restitution</strong>? Return to status quo?</li>
  <li>Should the damages be reduced because of a failure to mitigate?</li>
  <li>Are <strong>consequential damages</strong> called for? Cite Hadly v Baxendale, and the mnemonic is CCCC.</li>
  <li>If there is NO VALID, ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT what EQUITABLE remedies is available to the parties?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>A0. Always start the contract Question with following statements:</strong></p>
<p>The rights and remedies of the parties here depend on whether they had a valid contract. A contract is a promise or set of promises the performance of which the law will recognize as a duty and for the breach of which the law will provide a remedy.</p>
<p>A valid contract is based on offer, acceptance and consideration for legal purpose between the parties of legal capacity.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>A1. Does UCC apply?</strong></p>
<p>UCC Article 2 governs contracts for the <strong>sale</strong> of <strong>GOODS</strong>. <strong>GOODS</strong> are <strong>movable</strong> things at the time of identification of the contract.</p>
<p><strong>Example Template</strong></p>
<p>Here the quesiton involves a sale of &quot;widgets&quot; and they are clearly movable because they were to be &quot;delivered&quot;.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Here the contract is not for a sale of goods because it is a contract for personal services i.e. building a house</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>Article 2 of UCC applies</strong> / <strong>only the COMMON LAW applies</strong>.</p>
<p>These are sales of GOODS: 1) used cars, boats, stereos, RVs for <u>sale</u>; 2) firewood, harvested grain, cows; 3) "cut" flowers, "cut" Christmas trees; 4) "widgets", "gadgets" and "flibits" (if they are to be delivered); 5) carpet, even if installation is included</p>
<p>These are NOT SALES OF GOODS:  1) houses, land; 2) boats, cars and furniture <u>for rent;</u> 3) standing crops, the <u>right to cut</u> firewood; 4) growing flowers, the <u>right to cut down</u> and take a Christmas tree; 5) stocks, bonds, contracts, copyrights, patents; 6) building structures, even if materials are included; 7) <u>leased</u> equipment</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>A2. </strong><strong> STATUTE OF FRAUDS</strong></p>
<p>Mnemonic for Statute of Frauds is MYLEG. Contracts can be written if they are </p>
<ol>
  <li>a contract for marriage</li>
  <li>a contract that must take more than a year to complete (from date of execution)</li>
  <li>a contract for conveyence of an interest in Land (e.g rental agreements, sales, easements)</li>
  <li>a contract by an Executor of the estate of a deceased, and</li>
  <li>a contract by a Gurantor of a debt</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Common Law</strong><br>
<strong><br>
Issue:</strong> Need for a WRITING?<br>
<strong><br>
Rule:</strong> Under the Statute of Frauds, certain types of contracts must be written in order to be enforced.<br>
[This is always an issue if the contract is described as &quot;oral&quot; because the reader is saying &quot;oral contract&quot; to prompt discussion of this issue. Probably not an issue and not worth discussing if the contract is described as &quot;written&quot;.]<br>
<br>
<strong>Analysis:</strong> One type of contract that requires a writing is a contract for ....<br>
[Pick the following category that applies to your question ...]</p>
<ol>
  <li>Contracts that necessarily take more than a <strong>Year from execution to completion</strong>.</li>
  <li>Contracts for conveyance of interests in <strong>land</strong> or</li>
  <li>Contracts for <strong>Guarantee</strong> of a debt.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here a writing is needed because this is a contract for &quot;marriage&quot; [or land, gurantee of debt, etc.]</p>
<p>Note: If your exam question is of a type that DOES NOT require a writing, and no facts suggest that it might be, you might just say this:</p>
<p>Here no writing is needed because this contract is not of a type falling under the Statute of Frauds. Therefore, there was (not) a need for a writing in order for the agreement to be legally enforced as a contract, and the requirement is (not) met because ....</p>
<p><strong>More Examples of SOF:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>CL: Under the Statute of Frauds, certain types of contracts must be in writing to be enforced. A contract for conveyance of an interest in LAND often requires a writing, but not leaseholds of year or less.<br>
    <br>
    Here the question involves conveyance of an interest in land because the alleged agreement was to rent a 'house', but this appears to be a month to month rental.<br>
    <br>
  Therefore, a writing would not generally be required.</li>
  <li>UCC: Under <strong>UCC 2-201</strong> a contract for the <strong>sale</strong> of GOODS <strong>over $500</strong> requires a writing. This limit is being raised to $5,000 but many States are still using $500 limit. Under the UCC a contract between MERCHANTS may satisfy the need for a writing against both parties if there is a<strong> sales confirmation </strong>indicating the quantity sent to one party by the other and the receiving party <strong>does not object</strong> to the representation ofa contract.<br>
    <br>
  Further, under the UCC there is no need for a writing if goods are <strong>custom made</strong>, the person to be bound <strong>acknowledge the contract</strong> in a legal setting or where a party has <strong>accepted payment or goods</strong>. <br>
  <br>
  Here the goods are over $500 because the tuxedo costs &quot;$519.95&quot; And Al is not a merchant as shown above.<br>
  <br>
  Futhere, this was a &quot;ready-made&quot; tuxedo, not custom made, and Al never acknowledged the contract in a legal setting or accepted the goods.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, a writing <strong>signed by Al </strong>is needed if the contract is to be enforced against him by Bob. </li>
  <li>Under the Statute of Frauds a contract that necessarily takes more than a year to complete from the time of formation must be in writing to be enforceable by law. But if an oral agreement that fails to satisfy the statute is partially or fully performed, it may be enforceable at equity to the extent necessary to prevent injustice. To plead equity one must have &quot;clean hands&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    Here the contract would necessarily take more than a year because it was entered &quot;two days before&quot; Al was 17 and it was to last untill he was over &quot;18&quot;. That is more than a year.<br>
    <br>
  Therefore, the Statute of Frauds required  a writing even if Article 1 of UCC did not. Al only agreed to the contract orally, so and <strong>the contract was not enforceable against him at law because it was oral</strong>. <br>
  <br>
  Further, Tom would be unable to plead &quot;clean hands&quot; because he approves to have taken advantage of Al, a minor, and to have lied to Decra about Al's age.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, Tom would be unable to enforce the oral agreement against Al at either law or equity.  </li>
  <li>Under the Statute of Frauds a contract that necessarily takes more than a year to complete from the time of formation must be in writing to be enforceable by law.<br>
    <br>
    Here, Tom sent Al a &quot;signed&quot; confirmation that &quot;gave all the details&quot;. 
  And Al also has &quot;performed completely&quot;.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore 
  there may be sufficient &quot;writing&quot; signed by Tom that the Statute of Frauds might be satisfied. Otherwise Al would probably be able to force the contract against Tom at equity to the extent necessary to avoid injustice.</li>
  <li>Under the Statute of Frauds certain types of contracts must be in writing to be enforced. A contract for conveyance of an<strong> interest in LAND</strong> generally requires a writing, and contracts that necessarily must take <strong>more than a year</strong> to complete require a writing. <br>
    <br>
  Here the contract is for building a house, and doe not involve conveyance of an interst in land because Homere &quot;already owns&quot; the land. And the contract can be performed in less than a year because it was to be completed before the &quot;Winter rains&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
  Therefore, no writing is required by Statute of Frauds.</li>
  <li>Under the Statute of Frauds certain types of contracts must be in writing to be enforced. A contract for transfer of stock is not one of them.<br>
    <br>
  Therefore, no writing is required by the Statute of Frauds.</li>
  <li>UCC: Under <strong>UCC 2-201</strong> a contract for the <strong>sale</strong> of GOODS <strong>over $500</strong> requires a writing. This limit is being raised to $5,000 but many States are still using $500 limit. <br>
   <br>
     In a contract between MERCHANT the need for a writing may be satisfied by a<strong> sales confirmatio</strong>n indicating the quantity sent to one party by the other if the receiving party has reason to know the contents of the writing and does not object to the representation of a contract withing 10 days.   <br>
     <br>
  Here a writing is needed because the cost of the goods is $60,000 (&quot;10,000&quot; at &quot;$6&quot;). But this is &quot;between merchants&quot; because both parties appear to be merchants, and the 6/4 sales confirmation Sellco sent to Buyco specifies quantity at &quot;10, 000&quot;. That satisfies the requirement of 2-201.</li>

<p><strong>A5. BREACH  </strong></p>
<p><strong>1. ANTICIPATORY BREACH?</strong></p>
<p>Note: If the non-breaching party allows the breaching party to continue performance after the anticipatory breach, either discuss WAIVER OF THE BREACH as an accompanying issue (see below) or else consider skipping this issue altogether.</p>
<p>Under contract law an ANTICIPATORY REPUDIATION is a <strong>clear statement of intent </strong>or other <strong>clear indication</strong> by a party that <strong>they will not perform</strong> a future obligation. An anticipatory repudiation is a MAJOR breach. The effect is to 1) <strong>excuse</strong> the other party from performance and 2) <strong>accelerate</strong> all future obligations of the breaching party to the present. </p>
<p>If a party has a REASONABLE BASIS to believe the other party may not perform future contractual duties, the party may demand REASONABLE ASSURANCES and REFUSE TO PERFORM until they are provided. Reasonable assurances generally means a financial gurantee or payment into escrow.</p>
<p>If reasonable assurances are properly demanded and not provided, the failure to respond constitutes an anticipatory breach.</p>
<p>Here there was (not) an anticipatory breach because the party said &quot;....&quot; and that (did not) make it clear they were not going to perform. That did (not) form a reasonable basis for (the other party) to demand reasonable assurances because ... Therefore.... </p>
<p><strong>2. WAIVER of the breach?</strong></p>
<p>Note: This is an issue when there is an anticipatory breach or other major breach but afterward the non-breaching party lets the breaching party resume or continue performance.</p>
<p>Under contract law if a non-breaching party lets the breaching party continue performance after an anticipatory breach or other major breach it WAIVES THE BREACH (technically this is called an ELECTION). The waiver cannot be revoked, and the non-breaching party is forever ESTOPPED from citing the breach as major and can only cite it as a minor breach.</p>
<p>Here ... because ... Therefore...  </p>
<p>3. BREACH OF IMPLIED COVENANT?</p>
<p>4. BREACH of contract ? MAJOR or MINOR?</p>
<p><strong>5. ACCORD AND SATISFACTION?</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law an ACCORD AND SATISFACTION is an agreement by the contract parties <strong>to settle</strong> a <strong>reasonable</strong> and<strong> good faith</strong> claim of breach by one of the parties. It is binding on both parties. </p>
<p>The knowing acceptance by one party of any payment or other offer to settle a contract dispute by the other party is generally binding on both parties, even if the party accepting payment says they do so &quot;under protest&quot; or &quot;reserving their claim&quot; or some statement of that type. </p>

<p><strong>A6. THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY contract?</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law a THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY contract is one betwen a promisee who promises to give something of value to a promisor in exchange for the promisor's promise to do something to benefit a third party, the INTENDED THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY. If the purpose of the promisee are gratuitous, the third party beneficiary is called a DONEE BENEFICARY. If the promisee is acting to satisfy a legal obligation, the third party beneficiary is called a CREDITOR BENEFICIARY.</p>
<p>Promisors that breach third party beneficiary contracts are legally liable to both the promisees and all intended beneficiaries. Promisees that breach third party beneficiary contracts are legally liable to promisors and creditor beneficiaries but NOT to donee beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Under early common law parties that breached third party beneficiary contracts were only legally liable to intended beneficiaries that were VESTED because they had been <strong>aware of the existence of the contract and had relied on it</strong> before the breach occured. Modernly that requirement has been adandoned.</p>
<p>Donee beneficiaries can only seek a remedy against breaching <strong>promisees</strong> in EQUITY based on a claim of DETRIMENTAL RELIANCE.</p>
<p>When contrats would incidentally benefit third parties, but their benefit was not the purpose of the contracts, the third parties are called INCIDENTAL BENEFICIARIES. Parties that breach contracts have no liability to <strong>incidental</strong> beneficiaries in law or equity.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Third party questions require that you identify the parties and explain all of the rights and liabilites each party has against th eother parties. That usually takes so much time that there is little time left for anything else.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sample 3 (pg 8) Groucho's rights under a THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY CONTRACT?</strong><br>
    <br>
    Under contract law a THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY CONTRACT is one with main <strong>purpose</strong> of providing a <strong>benefit to a thrid party</strong>. The contract can be enforced by the original party, the promisee, or by a vested intended beneficiary.  <br>
    <br>
  A beneficiary may be a DONEE (of a gift) or a CREDITOR (payment of debt) beneficiary. The beneficiary <strong>vests</strong> upon becoming aware of and changing position in reliance on the contract. <br>
  <br>
  Here the <strong>purpose</strong> of the contract is to <strong>benefit</strong> Chico because he was to get a &quot;new Dodge&quot; as a &quot;birthday present.&quot; Therefore this is a third-party benefit contract. Chico is intended DONEE beneficiary because it is a &quot;birthday present&quot;.<br>
  <br>
  Groucho is the promisee because Harpo promised to &quot;deliver&quot; the car in &quot;two weeks&quot;. Harpo is the <strong>promisor</strong> because he has promised to deliver the car to Chico. <br>
  <br>
  Therefore, this is a third-party beneficiary contract, and Groucho as promisee can enforce it. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Groucho's REMEDIES?</strong><br>
  <br>
  Under the PERFECT TENDER RULE of the UCC a non-breaching buyer in a non-delivery situation can demand conforming goods, repudiate the contract or by goods to cover and demand the excess of the cover price over the contract price. <br>
  <br>
  Here Harpo has breached because he did not deliver the promised car.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, Groucho can demand delivery from Harpo or repudiate the contract and demand return of his $2,000. If he covers by buying the car elsewhere he can demand the excess of his cover price, if any, over the contract price.<br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Sample 3 (pg 82) </strong>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>CHICO V. HARPO </strong>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Chico's rights as a THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY?</strong><br>
            <br>
            Third party beneficiary contracts are defined above. Chico is an intended third-party beneficiary because the known purpose of the original contract was to give him a &quot;birthday present&quot;. He vested when he became aware of the original contract and changed position in reliance.<br>
            <br>
            A vested third-party beneficiary can enforce the contract against the promisor in the same manner as the promisee.<br>
            <br>
          Therefore, Chico can enforce the original contract against Harpo in the same manner and extent as Groucho.<br>
          <br>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Chico's REMEDIES</strong><br>
            <br>
            Chico's remedies would be the same as Groucho. <br>
            <br>
            </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><strong>CHICO V. SWIFTY</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>Chico's rights and remedies against Swifty?</strong><br>
        <br>
      Since Swifty agreed to perform the duties of Harpo, Swifty assumed the same liability as Harpo. And since Chico has the same enforcement rights as Groucho, Chico's rights and remedies to enforce the contract against Swifty are the same as against Harpo. <br>
      <br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>CHICO V. GROUCHO</strong><br>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Chico's rights and remedies against Groucho?</strong><br>
            <br>
            A donee beneficiary cannot enforce the promise of a gift against the promisee at law and can only enforce at equity based on promissory estoppel.<br>
            <br>
            Here Groucho entered into the contract with Harpo to give Chico a GIFT, so Chico was a DONEE beneficiary. Where there is no evidence Groucho has breached the contract with Harpo, and even if he did Chico would have no right to enforce the contract against Groucho at law.<br>
            <br>
            Therefore, if Groucho had refused to perform the contract (e.g. had refused to make the car payments) Chico could only plead equity against Groucho based on principals of promissory estoppel.
            <br>
            <br>
                                    </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2. ASSIGNMENT of contract benefits?</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law promisees can ASSIGN the benefits they are promised under a contrat to third parties called ASSIGNEES. Promisees who assign contract benefits are called ASSIGNORS.</p>
<p>Contract promises that they &quot;will not be assigned&quot; are &quot;mere covenants&quot; and not express material conditions unless the contract language is <strong>unequivocally clear </strong>that the contract parties intended for non-assignment to be an express material condition. Contract assginments in violation of express material conditions are void ab initio. Contract assignments in breach of mere covenants are minor breaches and promisors have a right to an award of damages against the promisees if any can be proven.</p>
<p>Contract assignments are only EFFECTIVE if assignors <strong>clearly express their intent to assign</strong> the contracts, and <strong>notice of the assignments have been given to the promisors</strong>.</p>
<p>If assignments are for gratuitous purposes the assignees are called DONEE ASSIGNEES and the assignments are LEGALLY REVOCABLE by the assignors untill they have been <strong>stated by assignors in writing</strong> OR a <strong>token chose has been delivered</strong>. Revocation of a gratuitous assignment may be estopped (in equity) based on a claim of detrimental reliance Assignment to a donee assignee is a gift, no contract is created between the assignor and the assignee, and the assignment does not imply any warranties by the assignor.</p>
<p>If assignments are made to satisfy legal obligations the assignees are called CREDITOR ASSIGNEES, the assignments create legal contracts between the assignees and the assignors (promisees), and they are IRREVOCABLE. An assignment to a creditor assignee implies warranties by the assignor 1) that the rights assigne exists, 2) that the promisee/assignor has the authority to assign them to the assignee, and 3) all documents provided to the assignee by the assignor are bone fide. The assignee may seek legal damages from the assignor for a breach of those warranties.</p>
<p>Promisors who breach contracts after they have been effectively assigned (and the assignment has not been effectively revoked) are <strong>only legally liable to the assignees</strong> and are<strong> NOT legally liable to the assignors (original promisees)</strong>. And the promisors can assert any legal or equitable defence against assignees that could have been asserted against the promisees but for the assignment.</p>
<p>Promisees (assignors) are not released from contract obligations by an assignent and if they breach the contracts after they assign them they are <strong>legally</strong> liable to promisors and <strong>creditor assignees</strong> but <strong>NOT to donee assignees</strong>. And the promisees can assert any legal or equitable defense against promisors and assignees that could have been asserted against promisors alone but for the assignment.</p>
<p><strong>Donee</strong> assignees can only seek a remey against breaching <strong>promisees</strong> in EQUITY based on a claim of DETRIMENTAL RELIANCE.</p>
<p>Here ... because .... Therefore ...</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the facts for an essay question say a party &quot;assigns the contract&quot; to a third party, rather than &quot;assigns the contract benefits&quot; that implies there was both an assignment (of contract benefits) and a delegation (of contract duties).</p>
<p><strong>3. MODIFICATION OF CONTRACT AFTER ASSIGNMENT?</strong></p>
<p>If a promisor and promisee agree to modify a contract after the promisee has assigned the contract rights to an assignee, the modification agreement is binding on the assignee IF the contract has <strong>not yet been fully performd</strong> AND the modification is made in good faith in accordance with reasonable commercial standards. The assignee acquires corresponding rights under the modified contract. </p>
<p><strong>Note, for example:</strong> Suppose promisee was to complete performance and be paid on 6/1, and promisee assigned the rights to be paid to assignee. Assignee had a right to be paid on 6/1. But if promisee and promisor agree to delay completion to 7/1 (perhaps because of material shortages) that is binding on assignee. Now assignee has a right to be paid on 7/1 and not on 6/1. </p>
<p><strong>4. DELEGATION of contract duties?</strong></p>
<p>Under Contract law promisors may DELEGATE the duties they have promised to perform under a contract to third parties called DELEGATEES. Promisors who assign conctract duties are called DELEGATORS.</p>
<p>Contracts that necessarily require the personal services of the promisors, and that cannot feasibly be performed by anyone else, are subject to implied material conditions that the promisors cannot delegate contract duties. Otherwise, express contract promises that they &quot;will not be assigned&quot; are &quot;mere covenants&quot; and not express material conditions unless the contract language is <strong>unequivocally clear</strong> that the contract parties intended for personal performance of contract duties by the promisor to be an express material condition.</p>
<p>Delegations of contract duties in violation of express or implied material conditions are void ab initio. Delegations of contract duties in breach of mere covenants are minor breaches and promisors have a right to an award of damages if any can be proven.</p>
<p>Contract delegations are only EFFECTIVE when the delegatee agrees to perform the duties of the promisor/delegator. No notice to the promisee is required.</p>
<p>Delegatees that GRATUITOUSLY agree to perform the duties of delegators/promisors are just volunteers, and they may be called VOLUNTEER DELEGATEES. Volunteer delegatees have no <strong>legal</strong> duty to perform.</p>
<p>Delegetees that agree to perform the duties of delegators/promisors in exchange FOR CONSIDERATION are legally bound in a DELEGATION CONTRACT with the delegator promisor and may be called CONTRACTED DELEGATEES. Contracted delegatees have a legal duty to perform.</p>
<p>Delegation contracts between delegators and contracted delegatees are third party beneficiary contracts because the promisee (in the original contract) is the intended beneficiary of the contract between the delegator and the contracted delegatee.</p>
<p>If delegatees fail to perform the delegator/promisor is always liable to the promisee, regardless whether the delegatee is a volunteer or a contracted delegatee.</p>
<p>If volunteer delegatees fail to perform they have no <strong>legal</strong> duty to anyone. Delegators (promisors) and promisees can only seek a remedy against volunteer delegatees in EQUITY based on claim of detrimental reliance.</p>
<p>If contracted delegatees fail to perform they are <strong>legally liable to both the delegators and the promisees</strong> of the original contract. The action of a promisee against a contracted delegatee is brought as a third party beneficiary under contract between the delegator and the contracted delegatee contract. Contracted delegatees can assert any defense against promisees that they could assert against delegators, and any defenses the delegators could assert against the promisees.</p>
<p>Here .. because ... Therefore..</p>
<p>Note: Like third party beneficiary questions, assignment and delegation questions require that you identify the parties, and explain all of the rights and liabilites each party has against the other parties. That usually takes so much time that there is little time left for anything else.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sample 3 (pg 81) Groucho's rights under the DELEGATION contract?</strong><br>
    Under contract law, a DELEGATION is a second contract conveying the duty of performance under the first contract from the original promisor to a delegatee. The promisor in the first contract retains primary liability to the promisee.
  The delegatee assumes secondary liability to the promisee of the first contract if she expressly accepts the delegation in exchange for consideration, a bargained for exchange of value creating legal liability. In the delegation contract between the promisor / delegator and the delegatee the original promisee is a CREDITOR third-party beneficiary with standing to enforce the contract.<br>
  <br>
  A delegatee can raise all defenses that are available to the promisee in the original contract.<br>
  <br>
  Here there is a delegation contract between Harpo and Swifty supported by consideration because Swifty expressly accepted the duty by saying he &quot;agreed to deliver&quot; in exchange for an &quot;immediate payment of $20,000&quot;.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, Groucho has standing to enforce Swifty's promise to deliver the car as a creditor third party beneficiary.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Groucho's REMEDIES against Swifty?</strong><br>
  A promisee under a contract can enforce the delegation contract as an intended third-party beneficiary in the same way as the original promisee of the delegation agreement (Harpo).<br>
  <br>
  Here Gruocho's remedies against Swifty are the same as his remedies against Harpo, and Groucho can recover from Swifty any amounts he cannot recover from Harpo.
<br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Sample 3 (pg 81) Harpo's rights under the DELEGATION contract?</strong><br>
    Delegation is defined above.<br>
    <br>
    Here the delegation from Harpo to Swifty is a contract between them because Swifty promised &quot;to deliver the car&quot;, and it is a legal contract supported by consideration because Swifty received an &quot;immediate payment of &quot;$20,000&quot;. Swifty was the promisor and Harp the promisee.<br>
    <br>
    Therefore, Harpo can enforce his contract with Swifty and seek recovery from Swifty for any damages due Groucho and / or Chico.
  </li>
</ol>

<hr>
<p><strong>A7. REMEDIES</strong></p>
<p>1. COMMON LAW REMEDY of the NON-BREACHING PARTY?</p>
<p>Under common law the non-breaching party has a right to <strong>COMPENSATORY DAMAGES</strong>, award of a money judgement calculated as the <strong>sum</strong> of:</p>
<ol>
  <li>RELIANCE DAMAGES, expenses incurred in reliance upon the promise of the breaching party,</li>
  <li>EXPECTATION DAMAGES, the loss of expected benefits caused by the breach,</li>
  <li>INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, expenses incurred after the breach as a result (e.g. storage charges),</li>
  <li>CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, lost profits on collateral contracts with third parties that could not be performed because of the breach.</li>
</ol>
<p>Under Hadley v Baxendale, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES can only be awarded if, at the time the original contract was executed, the breaching party knew of or otherwise could have contemplated the non-breaching party would enter into collateral contracts and would lose profits on them as a result of a contract breach.</p>
<p>The burden is on a non-breaching party to prove the damages suffered with CERTAINITY, to prove they were CAUSED BY THE BREACH, and that they COULD NOT BE AVOIDED after the breach occured. By implication this gives the non-breaching party a duty to <strong>mitigate damages</strong>.</p>
<p>As an alternative to requesting a money judgement based on damages the non breaching party has a legal right to demand LEGAL RESTITUTION, a money judgement calculated as the <strong>value of the benefits the breaching party received as a result of the non-breaching party's contract performance</strong>, up to the amount promised under the contract terms.</p>
<p>A non-breaching buyer of unique property may ask the Court (in equity) to award SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE on a claim that award of a money judgement would be an inadequate remedy. Specific performance of services by a natural person cannot be awarded by the Court because it violates the 13th Amendment. And there is no &quot;right&quot; to specific performance.</p>
<p>Here... because ... therefore...</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sample 6 (pg 92): </strong>Under contract law, remedies are COMPENSATORY to give the non-breaching party the benefit of the bargain, the compensation that had been bargained for. If property is UNIQUE money damages are in inadequate remedy and SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE is appropriate.<br>
    <br>
    Here the stock is not &quot;unique&quot; and money damages are adequate.<br>
    <br>
    Therefore Dottie's remedy is an award of money damages equal to the value of the stock.
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Sample 6 (pg 93) EQUITABLE RESITUTION?<br>
  </strong>At equity a party that cannot enforce a promise at law or equity may still seek damages in RESITUTION to prevent UNJUST ENRICHMENT. The measure of damages may be either the benefits their performance conveyed to the breaching party, or else the detriment they have suffered in reasonable reliance.<br>
  <br>
  Here Dottie can seek RESTITUTION for the benefits she conveyed to Fester. He enjoyed benefits that would have cost him $40,000 a year for ten years, so he enjoyed an unjust enrichment of $400,000.<br>
  <br>
  In the alternative Dottie suffered a loss of $50,000 on her house and foregone wages of $2,500,000 over the ten year period, for a total of $2,550,000.<br>
  <br>
  Dottie may seek an award of money damages in these amounts in equitable restitution.<br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Sample 7 (pg 97)
    </strong>Under the UCC a buyer who receives nonconforming goods can REJECT the goods and REPUDIATE the contract. They buyer can COVER by buying the goods elsewhere and demand the excess of the cover price over the contract price, or demand the excess of market price over the contract price.<br>
  <br>
    Here Buyco had a right to reject the goods, and it covered at a price of $5. Since this is less than the $6 contract price, Buyco has suffered <strong>no loss</strong> as a result of the breach and has no right to receive damages from Sellco.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, Buyco's demand for $50,000 has no basis and they would get nothing.</li>
</ol>
<p>2.      COMMON LAW REMEDY of the BREACHING PARTY?</p>
<p>Under contract law a breaching party that has not committed a major breach will be deemed to have SUBSTANTIALLY PERFORMED and has a right to receive all benefits and payments promised under the contract provisions less an OFFSET for the damages (or legal restitution) awarded to the non-breaching party.</p>
<p>A party that has committed a major breach has no <strong>legal</strong> right to any remedy and must plead in equity. A Court of equity may award the breaching party EQUITABLE RESTITUTION for amounts paid and benefits conferred to the extent they exceed damages awarded to the non-breaching party to PREVENT UNJUST ENRICHMENT or FRUSTRATION OF REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS based on a claim of implied-in-law contract.</p>
<p>Here... because ... therefore...</p>
<p>3. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES?</p>
<p>Under contract law a LIQUIDATED DAMAGES CLAUSE will be binding if it was a <strong>reasonable provision at the time the contract was executed</strong>, because it was foreseeable at the time the contract was executed a breach would cause damages that were not foreseeable in amount, AND it produces a <strong>reasonable remedy after the contract is breached</strong>. In this event the sole remedy for the non-breaching party is award of a money judgement in the amount specified in the contract.</p>
<p>Since a money judgement often is not an adequate remedy for a non-breaching buyer of unique property, liquidatd daages clauses generally will not produce a reasonable remedy and will not be binding in that situation.</p>
<p>Here... because ... therefore...</p>
<p>4. IMPLIED-IN-LAW CONTRACT?</p>
<p>IMPLIED-IN-LAW CONTRACT is an equitable theory or &quot;cause of action&quot; that may be pled by a movant when a contract fails or otherwise there is no valid enforceable contract which will provide a remedy. The Court has <strong>discretion</strong> to provide EQUITABLE RESTITUTION when there is <strong>no valid, legally enforceable contract</strong> if the movant<strong> acted to convey benefits</strong> to the responding party with a <strong>reasonable expectaion of being compensated</strong> in return.</p>
<p>The Court may either award the amount necessary to prevent an unjust enrichment to the respondent, or the amount necessary to prevent frustration of the reasonable expectations of the movant.</p>
<p>Here... because ... therefore...</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This argument should only be raised when no contract is otherwise enforceable at law. Perhaps there was a contract that violated the Statute of Frauds, there was a major breach, or the respondent lacked legal capacity. This equitable theory requires that the movant reasonably expected to be paid for services rendered.</p>
<p>5. PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL?</p>
<p>PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL is an equitable theory or &quot;cause of action&quot; that may be pled by a movant when there is <strong>no valid, legally enforceable contract or other legal cause of action</strong> but the movant has acted in<strong> reasonable reliance </strong>on a promise by the respondent,<strong> the respoondent intended to induce the movant to rely</strong> on the promise, and j<strong>ustice demands</strong> that the promise be enforced to some degree.</p>
<p>The Court may either estop the respondent from reneging on the promise or award the movant a money judgement in EQUITABLE RESTITUTION to prevent the respondent from reaping an unjust enrichment or to compensate the movant for injures suffered or to prevent frustration of reasonable expectations.</p>
<p>Here... because ... therefore...</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This argument should only be raised when the movant seeks to enforce an express promise by the respondent and there is no basis for a tort action for fraud or deceit. Often the promise is a <strong>gift promise</strong> or an assurance the respondent will not assert some legal defense or institute some legal action.</p>
<p>Example: </p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sample 4 (pg 86) PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL?</strong><br>
    Under the doctrine of PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL, a party can seek enforcement of an otherwise unenforceable promise where 1) a party <strong>made a promise</strong>; 2) 
  <strong>intending to induce reliance</strong>; 3) there was<strong> reasonable reliance</strong> by the other party and 4) <strong>injustice</strong> will result if the promise is not enforced.<br>
  <br>
  Here Al <strong>made a promise</strong> to Decca because he &quot;agreed on April 1 to a new agreement&quot;, and he did that <strong>intending to induce reliance</strong>. <br>
  <br>
  Al would argue that Decca
  did not reasonably rely because it was aware Al was a minor and could repudiate the contract at any time. Decca would argue that Al would reap an UNJUST ENRICHMENT because it incurred &quot;$360,000 in distributed expense.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, it would appear that Decca's restitution to Al should be reduced to this amount and restricted to the actual profit made by Decca
  </li>
</ol>
<p>6. DETRIMENTAL RELIANCE?</p>
<p>DETRIMENTAL RELIANCE is an equitable theory or &quot;cause of action&quot; that may be pled by a movant there is <strong>no valid, legally enforceable contract or other legal cause of action</strong>, but the movant <strong>acted in reasonable reliance </strong>on EITHER <strong>deliberately false representations of fact by the respondent</strong> OR <strong>deliberately misleading behavior of the respondent</strong> done with <strong>intent to induce reliance by the movant</strong>, and <strong>jutice demands </strong>that the promise be enforced to some degree.</p>
<p>The Court may award the movant a money judgment in EQUITABLE RESTITUTION to prevent the respondent from reaping an unjust enrichment or to compensate the movant for injuries suffered or to prevent frustration of reasonable expectations.</p>
<p>Here... because ... therefore...</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This argument should only be raised when there is no &quot;promise&quot; at all, and no other basis to claim either implied-in-law contract or promissory estoppel. They element here is that respondent must act (or refrain from acting) with deliberate intent to cause the movant to rely on either false statements of fact or else misleading behavior.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sample 6 (pg 93) EQUITABLE RESITUTION?</strong><br>
    <br>
  At equity a party that cannot enforce a promise at law or equity may still seek damages in RESITUTION to prevent UNJUST ENRICHMENT. The measure of damages may be either the benefits their performance conveyed to the breaching party, or else the detriment they have suffered in reasonable reliance.<br>
  <br>
  Here Dottie can seek RESTITUTION for the benefits she conveyed to Fester. He enjoyed benefits that would have cost him $40,000 a year for ten years, so he enjoyed an unjust enrichment of $400,000.<br>
  <br>
  In the alternative Dottie suffered a loss of $50,000 on her house and foregone wages of $2,500,000 over the ten year period, for a total of $2,550,000.<br>
  <br>
  Dottie may seek an award of money damages in these amounts in equitable restitution.</li>

      <p>UCC Article 2 governs contracts for <strong>sale</strong> of GOODS, <strong>movable</strong> things at the time of identification to the contract. Otherwise, only COMMON LAW governs the contract. </p>
      <p>Here the contract does not concern a <strong>sale</strong> of <strong>movable things </strong>because it is for the &quot;rent&quot; of a &quot;house&quot;. </p>
      <p>Therefore, only COMMON LAW principles govern this contract.</p>
      <p>2. Is a WRITING REQUIRED?</p>
      <p>Under the STATUTE OF FRAUDS certain types of contract must be in writing to be enforced. A contract for conveyance of an interest in LAND often requires a writing, but not leaseholds of a year or less.</p>
      <p>Here the question involves conveyance of an interest in land because the alleged agreement was to rent a &quot;house&quot;, but this appears to be a month-month rental.</p>
      <p>Therefore, a writing would not generally be required. </p>
      <p>3. Was the ADVERTISEMENT an OFFER?</p>
      <p>Under contract law an OFFER is a <strong>manifestation of present intent </strong>to enter into a bargain <strong>communicated</strong> to the offeree and sufficiently specific that an observer would reasonably believe assent would form a bargain. Advertisements are generally not offers because they usually fail to identity the parties or the quantity being offered. </p>
      <p>Here the advertisement was <strong>not specific</strong> as to the parties because it did not guarantee that Lucy would rent to the first person to respond. </p>
      <p>Therefore, the advertisement was not an offer. </p>
      <p>4. Was the 9:00 statement by Homer an OFFER?</p>
      <p>Offer is defined supra</p>
      <p>Here the statement by Homer did not appear to <strong>manifest intent</strong> to enter into a bargain because  even though he said, &quot;I accept&quot; he added that he &quot;had to see the house first&quot;. No reasonable person would believe assent to that statement would form a bargain because it was clear he wanted to &quot;see the house first&quot;. </p>
      <p>Therefore the statement was not an offer. </p>
      <p>5. Was the 9.00 response by Lucy an OFFER?</p>
      <p>Offer is defined supra</p>
      <p>Here the statement by Lucy did  manifest intent to enter into a bargain because she said &quot;It's a deal, I will rent to you for $550.&quot; A reaonable person would believe assent to that statment  would form a bargain.</p>
      <p>Therefore that statement was an offer.</p>
      <p>6. Did Homer have a valid OPTION?</p>
      <p>Offer is defined supra. Under common law an OPTION is a contractual agreement that an offeror will not revoke an offer for a specific period of time <strong>in exchange for CONSIDERATION from the offeree</strong>. CONSIDERATION is an <strong>exchange</strong> of promises posing <strong>legal detriment</strong> such that the law deems it sufficient to support an agreement. </p>
      <p>Here Lucy promised to give a &quot;firm offer&quot;, but Homer <strong>gave no promise or value in exchange</strong>. While the UCC provides for &quot;firm offers&quot; from merchants, the UCC does not govern here. Therefore, Lucy received no legal consideration in exchange for her promise to give a &quot;firm offer&quot; and her promise cannot be enforced against her as an option contract.</p>
      <p>Therefore, Lucy's offer did not create an option contract, and she could revoke her offer at any time.</p>
      <p>7. Did Homer effectively ACCEPT at 3.00?</p>
      <p>At common law an acceptance must be an<strong> unequivocal assent </strong>to the <strong>terms</strong> of an offer, dispatched to the offeror in the manner required, or if no manner is required in the offer, by the means by which the offer <strong>was dispatched</strong> or some <strong>faster</strong> means. An offer must be accepted before it <strong>LAPSES</strong>. Unless there is an option, an offer lapses in the time stated or if no <strong>time stated</strong> within a <strong>reasonable time </strong>after the offer is made. </p>
      <p>Here the reasonable time for acceptance of Lucy's offer is defined by the understanding that Homer would view the house in only one hour at &quot;10:00&quot;. That understanding established the &quot;reasonable time&quot; within which Homer could accept the offer. But Homer was &quot;five hours late,&quot; as Lucy's offer had already lapsed when he arrived. Homer's attempt to unequivocally accept Lucy's 9:00 offer by saying &quot;I unequivocally accept&quot; was ineffective because he could not accept an offer that had already lapsed.</p>
    <p>Therefore, Homer's attempt to accept was ineffective. </p></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>[Explanation: This question is a typical FORMATION question because it goes through a series of communications between the parties. When you see messages going back and forth, it is a FORMATION question, so analyze each message.</p>
      <p>Start with an INTRODUCTORY DEFINITION of a contract. Then chronologically analyze each communication to see if it is an OFFER. Once there is an offer, the next issue is whether the offer is ACCEPTED.</p>
      <p>If there is offer and an acceptance a contract forms and the next issue is the TERMS of the contract.</p>
    <p>After the contract terms are discussed the next issue is whether there has been a BREACH. And if there is a berach, the issues are WHO BREACHED and the REMEDIES of the parties.] </p></td>

    <td valign="top"><p>Al had bought a lot of clothes over the years. One day he called tailor Bob and asked him to custom make him a tuxedo to wear to the wedding of his daughter Carla the next Sunday. </p>
      <p>Bob told Al that he could not make a tuxedo so fast and suggested instead that Al buy a ready- made tuxedo that he had in stock in exactly Al's size. Al agreed and said he would be in to pick it up later that week. Price was not discussed. </p>
      <p>Bob sent Al a note several days later stating, &quot;This is to confirm your order to purchase the tuxedo. The price is normally $750, but for you the price is only $519.95.&quot; </p>
      <p>Al was shocked at the price, but it was too late for him to get a tuxedo anywhere else on such short notice. He felt he had been taken advantage of, but there was nothing he could do. </p>
      <p>Al came in and tried the tuxedo on the day before the wedding and it did not fit. Bob assured him not to worry. He would take it in. Al nodded. </p>
      <p>Bob took in the pants and sent Al a note that said, &quot;I took in the pants and it should fit you like a glove. With alterations the price is now $750. </p>
      <p>Al was furious. </p>
      <p>Carla's wedding was suddenly called off. Al never called Bob and never went to get the tuxedo. Bob was furious. </p>
    <p>Does Bob have a right to be paid for the tuxedo? What are Al's defenses? </p></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>BOB v. AL</p>
      <p>The rights and remedies of the parties here depend on whether there was a valid contract.  A <strong>CONTRACT</strong> is a promise or set of promises the performance of which the law will recognize as a duty and for the breach of which the law will provide a remedy.</p>
      <p>1. UCC?</p>
      <p>Article 2 of the UCC governs contracts for the <strong>sale</strong> of GOODS, <strong>movable things</strong> at the time of identification to the contract.</p>
      <p>Here the contract is for <strong>sale</strong> of a <strong>movable thing</strong> because it was for sale of a &quot;tuxedo&quot;.</p>
      <p>Therefore this was a contract for a sale of <strong>goods</strong> and the UCC governs.</p>
      <p>2. MERCHANTS?</p>
      <p>Under the UCC MERCHANTS are people who <strong>deal</strong> in the goods or hold themselves out by occupation as <strong>knowledgeable</strong> about the goods in a contract.</p>
      <p>Here Bob <strong>deals</strong> in tuxedos because he has a clothing store. Al may have &quot;bought a lot of clothes&quot; but there is no evidence he deals in tuxedos or hold himself out by occupation as being particularly knowledgeable about them.</p>
      <p>Therefore Bob is a merchant and Al is not.</p>
      <p>3. Is a WRITING NEEDED?</p>
      <p>Under UCC 2-201 a contract for the <strong>sale</strong> of GOODS <strong>over $500</strong> requires a writing. This limit is being raised to $5,000 but many States are still using the $500 limit. Under the UCC a contract between MERCHANTS may satisfy the need for a writing against both parties if there is a <strong>sales confirmation</strong> indicating the quantity sent to one party by the other and the receiving party <strong>does not object </strong>to the representation of a contract.</p>
      <p>Further, under the UCC there is no need for a writing if goods are <strong>custom made</strong>, the person to be bound <strong>acknowledges the contract </strong>in a legal setting or where a party has <strong>accepted payment or goods</strong>.</p>
      <p>Here the goods are over $500 because the tuxedo costs &quot;$519.95&quot; and Al is not a merchant as shown above.</p>
      <p>Further, this was a &quot;ready-made&quot; tuxedo, not custom made, and Al never acknowledged the contract in a legal setting or accepted the goods.</p>
    <p>Therefore a writing signed by Al is needed if the contract is to be enforced against him by Bob.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>under construction..... </p></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>[Explanation: This is a UCC question, obviously. Bob breached by delivering non-conforming goods that failed to provide a perfect fit, as promised. But he has time to cure, and gave notice he intended to cure.</p>
      <p>If Al wants out of the deal, he can claim a lack of writing. He can do that because he is not a merchant, and the &quot;sale confirmation&quot; does not apply to him. He would be a merchant if he were a collector or hobbyist. But just buying lots of clothes doesn't make him a merchant any more than you are a merchant because you have bought a lot of groceries.</p>
    <p>And Al also possibly can claim frustration of purpose.] </p></td>

        What are the rights, remedies and defenses of Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Swifty? </p></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>The rights and remedies of the parties here depend on whether there was a valid contract. A CONTRACT is a promise or set of promises the performance of which the law will recognize as a duty and for the breach of which the law will provide a remedy.</p>
        <p>1. UCC?</p>
      <p>UCC Article 2 governs the contracts for the <strong>sale</strong> of GOODS, <strong>movable</strong> things at the time of identification to the contract.</p>
      <p>Here the question involves a <strong>sale</strong> of a &quot;car&quot; and it is <strong>movable</strong> because it was to be delivered.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the UCC applies here. </p>
      <p><strong>GROUCHO v. HARPO</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2. Groucho's rights under a THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY CONTRACT?</strong><br>
            <br>
        Under contract law a THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY CONTRACT is one with main <strong>purpose</strong> of providing a <strong>benefit to a thrid party</strong>. The contract can be enforced by the original party, the promisee, or by a vested intended beneficiary. <br>
        <br>
        A beneficiary may be a DONEE (of a gift) or a CREDITOR (payment of debt) beneficiary. The beneficiary <strong>vests</strong> upon becoming aware of and changing position in reliance on the contract. <br>
        <br>
        Here the <strong>purpose</strong> of the contract is to <strong>benefit</strong> Chico because he was to get a &quot;new Dodge&quot; as a &quot;birthday present.&quot; Therefore this is a third-party benefit contract. Chico is intended DONEE beneficiary because it is a &quot;birthday present&quot;.<br>
        <br>
        Groucho is the promisee because Harpo promised to &quot;deliver&quot; the car in &quot;two weeks&quot;. Harpo is the <strong>promisor</strong> because he has promised to deliver the car to Chico. <br>
        <br>
        Therefore, this is a third-party beneficiary contract, and Groucho as promisee can enforce it. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>3. Groucho's REMEDIES?</strong><br>
        <br>
        Under the PERFECT TENDER RULE of the UCC a non-breaching buyer in a non-delivery situation can demand conforming goods, repudiate the contract or by goods to cover and demand the excess of the cover price over the contract price. <br>
        <br>
        Here Harpo has breached because he did not deliver the promised car.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, Groucho can demand delivery from Harpo or repudiate the contract and demand return of his $2,000. If he covers by buying the car elsewhere he can demand the excess of his cover price, if any, over the contract price. </p>
      <p><strong>GROUCHO V. SWIFTY</strong></p>
      <p><strong>4. Groucho's rights under the DELEGATION contract?</strong><br>
        Under contract law, a DELEGATION is a second contract conveying the duty of performance under the first contract from the original promisor to a delegatee. The promisor in the first contract retains primary liability to the promisee.
        The delegatee assumes secondary liability to the promisee of the first contract if she expressly accepts the delegation in exchange for consideration, a bargained for exchange of value creating legal liability. In the delegation contract between the promisor / delegator and the delegatee the original promisee is a CREDITOR third-party beneficiary with standing to enforce the contract.<br>
          <br>
        A delegatee can raise all defenses that are available to the promisee in the original contract.<br>
        <br>
        Here there is a delegation contract between Harpo and Swifty supported by consideration because Swifty expressly accepted the duty by saying he &quot;agreed to deliver&quot; in exchange for an &quot;immediate payment of $20,000&quot;.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, Groucho has standing to enforce Swifty's promise to deliver the car as a creditor third party beneficiary.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>5. Groucho's REMEDIES against Swifty?</strong><br>
        A promisee under a contract can enforce the delegation contract as an intended third-party beneficiary in the same way as the original promisee of the delegation agreement (Harpo).<br>
        <br>
        Here Gruocho's remedies against Swifty are the same as his remedies against Harpo, and Groucho can recover from Swifty any amounts he cannot recover from Harpo. </p>
      <p><strong>HARPO V. SWIFTY</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6. Harpo's rights under the DELEGATION contract?</strong><br>
        Delegation is defined above.<br>
        <br>
        Here the delegation from Harpo to Swifty is a contract between them because Swifty promised &quot;to deliver the car&quot;, and it is a legal contract supported by consideration because Swifty received an &quot;immediate payment of &quot;$20,000&quot;. Swifty was the promisor and Harp the promisee.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, Harpo can enforce his contract with Swifty and seek recovery from Swifty for any damages due Groucho and / or Chico. </p>
      <p><strong>CHICO V. HARPO</strong></p>
      <p><strong>7. Chico's rights as a THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY?</strong><br>
        <br>
        Third party beneficiary contracts are defined above. Chico is an intended third-party beneficiary because the known purpose of the original contract was to give him a &quot;birthday present&quot;. He vested when he became aware of the original contract and changed position in reliance.<br>
        <br>
        A vested third-party beneficiary can enforce the contract against the promisor in the same manner as the promisee.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, Chico can enforce the original contract against Harpo in the same manner and extent as Groucho.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>8. Chico's REMEDIES</strong><br>
          <br>
        Chico's remedies would be the same as Groucho. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>CHICO V. SWIFTY</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>9. Chico's rights and remedies against Swifty?</strong><br>
        <br>
        Since Swifty agreed to perform the duties of Harpo, Swifty assumed the same liability as Harpo. And since Chico has the same enforcement rights as Groucho, Chico's rights and remedies to enforce the contract against Swifty are the same as against Harpo. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>CHICO V. GROUCHO</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>10. Chico's rights and remedies against Groucho?</strong><br>
          <br>
        A donee beneficiary cannot enforce the promise of a gift against the promisee at law and can only enforce at equity based on promissory estoppel.<br>
        <br>
        Here Groucho entered into the contract with Harpo to give Chico a GIFT, so Chico was a DONEE beneficiary. Where there is no evidence Groucho has breached the contract with Harpo, and even if he did Chico would have no right to enforce the contract against Groucho at law.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, if Groucho had refused to perform the contract (e.g. had refused to make the car payments) Chico could only plead equity against Groucho based on principals of promissory estoppel.

Tom was to receive 25 percent of &quot;sales.&quot; </p>
      <p>Tom sent Al a signed, written &quot;sales confirmation&quot; of their agreement that gave all of the details of the agreement. The memo pointed out that records are &quot;goods&quot; under the UCC. After this Al performed completely under the terms of the agreement. </p>
      <p>Tom pitched Al's song to Deccra Records telling them Al was 19 years old, an adult. Following negotiations by Tom, Deccra and Al signed a written agreement on March 1 that Al would receive 50 percent of gross record sales over the next three years. Deccra was aware that Tom would receive a portion of this money under his contract with Al. </p>
      <p>Before Deccra paid anything it discovered Al was only 17. A Deccra executive secretly met with Al and told him the company would not stand by its first agreement, and an alternative agreement was proposed that would benefit both parties. Al agreed on April 1 to a new arrangement under which he got 40 percent of gross record sales, Deccra got 60 percent and Tom was cut completely out. </p>
      <p>The song went straight to the top of the charts and Deccra's sales were $1.6 million in the next year. Of this amount Deccra paid Al $640,000, 40 percent of gross sales. Deccra's distribution expenses were $360,000, and it made profits of $600,000. Tom got nothing. </p>
