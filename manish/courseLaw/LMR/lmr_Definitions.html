<h3>Contracts</h3>
<p><strong>A0. Always start the contract Question with following statements:</strong></p>
<p>The rights and remedies of the parties here depend on whether they had a valid contract. A contract is a promise or set of promises the performance of which the law will recognize as a duty and for the breach of which the law will provide a remedy.</p>
<p>A valid contract is based on offer, acceptance and consideration for legal purpose between the parties of legal capacity.</p>
<p><strong>A1. Does UCC apply?</strong></p>
<p>UCC Article 2 governs contracts for the <strong>sale</strong> of <strong>GOODS</strong>. <strong>GOODS</strong> are <strong>movable</strong> things at the time of identification of the contract.</p>
<p><strong>Example Template</strong></p>
<p>Here the quesiton involves a sale of &quot;widgets&quot; and they are clearly movable because they were to be &quot;delivered&quot;.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Here the contract is not for a sale of goods because it is a contract for personal services i.e. building a house</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>Article 2 of UCC applies</strong> / <strong>only the COMMON LAW applies</strong>.</p>
<p>These are sales of GOODS: 1) used cars, boats, stereos, RVs for <u>sale</u>; 2) firewood, harvested grain, cows; 3) "cut" flowers, "cut" Christmas trees; 4) "widgets", "gadgets" and "flibits" (if they are to be delivered); 5) carpet, even if installation is included</p>
<p>These are NOT SALES OF GOODS:  1) houses, land; 2) boats, cars and furniture <u>for rent;</u> 3) standing crops, the <u>right to cut</u> firewood; 4) growing flowers, the <u>right to cut down</u> and take a Christmas tree; 5) stocks, bonds, contracts, copyrights, patents; 6) building structures, even if materials are included; 7) <u>leased</u> equipment</p>
<p><strong>A2. Types of Contracts</strong></p>
<p>After above discussion, try to find out the type of contract question, there are 6 types of contract questions and / or mixes of all 6 types</p>
<p><strong>Type 1: Formation of Contracts - Questions?</strong></p>
<p>If questions says, a valid contract is formed, then don't discuss formation of contract.</p>
<p>For formation of contract, go through each communication between the parties one by one addressing these issues in this order.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Was there a valid OFFER?
    <ol>
      <li>Was there manifestation of INTENT?</li>
      <li>Not effectively REVOKED?</li>
      <li>A GENERAL offer?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Was there an ACCEPTANCE of an offer?
    <ol>
      <li>Not REJECTED by offeree?</li>
      <li>A TIMELY acceptance?</li>
      <li>MIRROR IMAGE RULE (CL) ?</li>
      <li>Accepted by SHIPMENT (UCC) ?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What were the TERMS of the contract?
    <ol>
      <li>Is it <strong>unequivocally clear</strong> the offer is for a UNILATERAL contact?</li>
      <li>Certain as to TERMS?</li>
      <li>A DIVISIBILE contract (UCC) ?</li>
      <li>A PRODUCTION or REQUIREMENTS contract (UCC) ?</li>
      <li>Is <strong>timely performance </strong>an express condition or mere covenant?</li>
      <li>Is <strong>personal satisfaction</strong> an express condition or is there just a promise to render <strong>reasonably satisfactory</strong> performance (an implied condition of every contract) ?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Supported by CONSIDERATION? (Watch for MODIFICATION and ILLUSIONARY PROMISE problems)</li>
  <li>Was the contract for a LEGAL PURPOSE? (Omit if not an issue)</li>
  <li>Between parties with LEGAL CAPACITY? (Watch for MINORS)</li>
</ol>
<p>Follow this pattern:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First look at each communication <strong>chronologically</strong> as a <strong>separate issue</strong> to see if it is an <strong>offer</strong>.</li>
  <li>Second, after you find an offer, examine each following communication as a separate issue looking for an acceptance. It often is a rejection and counter-offer.</li>
  <li>Watch out for and apply the mailbox rules to revocations and rejections by mail/fax.</li>
  <li>When you get a valid acceptance to a valid offer, BINGO !, you have a contract. So the <strong>very next single issue</strong> is to determine its <strong>terms</strong>.</li>
  <li>Don't discuss consideration, legal purpose or legal capacity of the parties <strong>unless the facts call for discussion</strong>.
    <ol>
      <li>Remember that consideration is a <strong>bargained for exchange</strong>.</li>
      <li>No <strong>moral obligation</strong></li>
      <li>No <strong>prior consideration</strong></li>
      <li>No promise qualified by a <strong>future decision</strong> to perform.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Type 2: Term Disputes</strong></p>
<p>These raise the questions &quot;What were the terms of the contract?&quot; If FORMATION is in doubt, then the TERMS are probably in dispute as well. Look at the total communication and course of dealing between the parties and address these issues:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Was the agreement CERTAIN that a court can enforce it?
    <ol>
      <li>Remember for UCC only the quantity and parties must be certain.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, were the subject matter, time, price, quantity and parties certain?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Was there a MODIFICATION that was ineffective because unsupported by consideration? Remember this does not apply the UCC question!</li>
  <li>Does the PAROLE EVIDENCE RULE exclude extrinsic evidence? (Remember the mnemonic DAM FOIL!)</li>
</ol>
<p>There are <strong>three situations </strong>where the parties dispute the terms. Usually this is <strong>only one issue </strong>and it will be one of the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Is the contract<strong> too uncertain</strong> to be enforced?
<ol>
      <li>No quantity stated? (Not a UCC <strong>requirements</strong> or <strong>production</strong> contract)</li>
      <li>Parties uncertain?</li>
      <li>Uncertain as to time, price, subject matter? (Not UCC where <strong>gap fillers</strong> apply)<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Is the <strong>modification</strong> supported by adequate consideration?
<ol>
      <li>Prior Obligation?</li>
      <li>This does not apply to UCC where no considerations is needed?<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Does the <strong>parole evidence rule</strong> bar extrinsic evidence of additional terms?
    <ol>
      <li>Merger clause?</li>
      <li>Contract complete within the four corners of the document?</li>
      <li>Remember the <strong>exceptions</strong> (mnemonic = DAM FOIL)<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Was <strong>time performance</strong> an EXPRESS CONDITION (material condition) or just a COVENANT (not a material condition)?</li>
  <li>Was <strong>personal satisfaction</strong> an EXPRESS CONDITION (a material condition that the buyer must actually be satisfied) or just a COVENANT (an expression of the implied condition inherent in all contracts that performance must be &quot;reasonably satisfactory&quot;)?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Type 3: Anticipatory Breach Questions.</strong></p>
<p>These raise the questions, &quot;Who breached first?&quot; There are two kinds of breach, either <strong>breaches in fact</strong> or <strong>anticipatory repudiation</strong>. </p>
<p>A breach in fact means that <strong>party did not perform</strong> at the time they were supposed to perform.</p>
<p>An anticipatory repudiation means that a party <strong>clearly</strong> states an <strong>intent or inability</strong> to perform at some time in the <strong>future</strong>.</p>
<p>For anticipatory breach questions <strong>look at each communication</strong> between the parties one by one until you find the <strong>first clear breach</strong>. Remember, only one party can breach a contract at a time. Once the first party breaches, the other party CANNOT breach unless the contract is &quot;reformed&quot; by waiver or accord of a good faith dispute.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Was there an ANTICIPATORY REPUDIATION - a clear statement of intent not to perform a future obligation?</li>
  <li>Was there a WAIVER of the anticipatory breach?</li>
  <li>Was there an ACCORD AND SATISFACTION of a good faith dispute?</li>
  <li>Was timely performance an express condition or mere covenant?</li>
  <li>Was personal satisfaction an express condition or is there just a promise to render reasonably satisfactory performance (an implied condition of every contract)?</li>
</ol>
<p>These situations are where one party says, &quot;I don't think I can meet the deadline.&quot; Then the other party says, &quot;Oh yeah? Well then the deal's off. Follow this pattern:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Look at each communication as a <strong>separate issue</strong> to see if it is a <strong>clear statement of intent not to perform at a future time</strong>. If a party says they don't think they will be able to perform in the future, that is expression of a <strong>doubt</strong> and not an expression of an <strong>intent</strong>.</li>
  <li>The<strong> first party</strong> to clearly state an intent to not perform is the breaching party.</li>
  <li>When a party breaches the next issue is the effect of the anticipatory breach. 1) <strong>excuses</strong> the non breaching party from performance and it 2) <strong>accelerates</strong> the performance obligation of the breaching party.</li>
  <li>The <strong>next issue </strong>is whether the non-breaching party <strong>waives the breach</strong> by allowing the breaching party to continue performance under the contract.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Type 4: Defense Questions</strong></p>
<p>These raise the following issues:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Does the STATUTE OF FRAUDS (OR UCC 2 - 201 in the case of a sale of goods) require writings?
    <ol>
      <li>Was the need for writing satisfied?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Did the contract (or modification if not a UCC question) lack CONSIDERATION?</li>
  <li>Was the contract for an ILLEGAL purpose (or unconscionable / adhesion contract) ?</li>
  <li>Was the contract voidable by a MINOR or other party lacking capacity?</li>
  <li>Was the contract void because it was the product of FRAUD or DURESS?</li>
  <li>Was the contract void because of MUTUAL MISTAKE?</li>
  <li>Was the contract void because of performance was IMPOSSIBLE or FRUSTRATION OF PURPOSE?</li>
</ol>
<p>If there is a breach, go through each of the breaching party's defenses as separate issues:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First, was there an<strong> insufficient writing</strong> to satisffy the Statute of Frauds?</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of consideration</strong>? Prior obligation? Moral obligation? Prior consideration? Gift promise?</li>
  <li>Illegal purpose? Does <strong>in pare delicto</strong> apply?</li>
  <li>Breaching party a <strong>minor</strong> or <strong>incapacitated</strong>? But, did they repudiate within time after removal of incapacity?</li>
  <li>Contract induced by <strong>fraud</strong>, <strong>duress</strong>, or because of <strong>mistake</strong>? Did the non-breaching party know, or should they have known that the other party was mistaken?</li>
  <li><strong>Performance impossible</strong> or <strong>purpose frustrated</strong>? Was it absolutely impossible? These situations violate IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITIONS of the contract, causing it to fail.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Type 5: Third Party Questions</strong></p>
<p>These raise the question, &quot;Who has the right to enforce?&quot;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Were there THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES?</li>
  <li>Was there a VALID ASSIGNMENT?</li>
  <li>Was there a VALID DELEGATION?</li>
</ol>
<p>These are similar to defenses, and the isuses raised are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Does the third party have standing to braing an action? Intended beneficiary?</li>
  <li>Was there an improper assignment of the contract? Notice not given?</li>
  <li>Was there an improper delegation of the contract? Personal services?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Type 6: Remedy Questions</strong></p>
<p>These raise the question, &quot;What remedy does each party have?&quot; </p>
<ol>
  <li>Does a party get time to CURE (UCC)?</li>
  <li>What are the UCC remedies (COVER, REJECT, etc)?</li>
  <li>Did the non-breaching party FAIL TO MITIGATE damages?</li>
  <li>Was there SUBSTANTIAL PERFORMANCE (a MINOR breach) or MAJOR breach?</li>
  <li>Can a party obtain SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE?</li>
  <li>Can the non breaching party get CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (LOST PROFITS)?
    <ol>
      <li>Cite Hadley v. Baxendale</li>
      <li>Remember the mnemonic CCCC.</li>
      <li>Were lost profits <strong>Contemplated</strong> by the parties at time of execuation?</li>
      <li>Were lost profits <strong>Caused</strong> by the breach?</li>
      <li>Were lost profits <strong>Certain</strong> as to amounts?</li>
      <li>Was the lost profits something that <strong>Couldn't</strong> be avoided.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Do the SAVING DOCTRINES of the unilateral contract apply?</li>
  <li>If there is NO VALID ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT can the parties obtain EQUITABLE RELIEF?</li>
  <li>Can promises be enforced based on ESTOPPEL?</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of the remedies is a separtate issue. Only discuss the issues that apply.</p>
<ol>
  <li>If there was a valid contract, was there <strong>substantial performance</strong>? Benefit of bargain.</li>
  <li>Can the plaintiff obtain <strong>specific performance</strong>? Unique goods?</li>
  <li>Can the contract be enforced based on <strong>promissory estoppel</strong>? Injustice resulting?</li>
  <li>Can the party obtain <strong>rescission</strong> and <strong>restitution</strong>? Return to status quo?</li>
  <li>Should the damages be reduced because of a failure to mitigate?</li>
  <li>Are <strong>consequential damages</strong> called for? Cite Hadly v Baxendale, and the mnemonic is CCCC.</li>
  <li>If there is NO VALID, ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT what EQUITABLE remedies is available to the parties?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>A3 STATUTE OF FRAUDS</strong></p>
<p>Mnemonic for Statute of Frauds is MYLEG. Contracts can be written if they are </p>
<ol>
  <li>a contract for marriage</li>
  <li>a contract that must take more than a year to complete (from date of execution)</li>
  <li>a contract for conveyence of an interest in Land (e.g rental agreements, sales, easements)</li>
  <li>a contract by an Executor of the estate of a deceased, and</li>
  <li>a contract by a Gurantor of a debt</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Common Law</strong><br>
<strong><br>
Issue:</strong> Need for a WRITING?<br>
<strong><br>
Rule:</strong> Under the Statute of Frauds, certain types of contracts must be written in order to be enforced.<br>
[This is always an issue if the contract is described as &quot;oral&quot; because the reader is saying &quot;oral contract&quot; to prompt discussion of this issue. Probably not an issue and not worth discussing if the contract is described as &quot;written&quot;.]<br>
<br>
<strong>Analysis:</strong> One type of contract that requires a writing is a contract for ....<br>
[Pick the following category that applies to your question ...]</p>
<ol>
  <li>Contracts that necessarily take more than a <strong>Year from execution to completion</strong>.</li>
  <li>Contracts for conveyance of interests in <strong>land</strong> or</li>
  <li>Contracts for <strong>Guarantee</strong> of a debt.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here a writing is needed because this is a contract for &quot;marriage&quot; [or land, gurantee of debt, etc.]</p>
<p>Note: If your exam question is of a type that DOES NOT require a writing, and no facts suggest that it might be, you might just say this:</p>
<p>Here no writing is needed because this contract is not of a type falling under the Statute of Frauds. Therefore, there was (not) a need for a writing in order for the agreement to be legally enforced as a contract, and the requirement is (not) met because ....</p>
<p><strong>More Examples of SOF:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>CL: Under the Statute of Frauds, certain types of contracts must be in writing to be enforced. A contract for conveyance of an interest in LAND often requires a writing, but not leaseholds of year or less.<br>
    <br>
    Here the question involves conveyance of an interest in land because the alleged agreement was to rent a 'house', but this appears to be a month to month rental.<br>
    <br>
  Therefore, a writing would not generally be required.</li>
  <li>UCC: Under <strong>UCC 2-201</strong> a contract for the <strong>sale</strong> of GOODS <strong>over $500</strong> requires a writing. This limit is being raised to $5,000 but many States are still using $500 limit. Under the UCC a contract between MERCHANTS may satisfy the need for a writing against both parties if there is a<strong> sales confirmation </strong>indicating the quantity sent to one party by the other and the receiving party <strong>does not object</strong> to the representation ofa contract.<br>
    <br>
  Further, under the UCC there is no need for a writing if goods are <strong>custom made</strong>, the person to be bound <strong>acknowledge the contract</strong> in a legal setting or where a party has <strong>accepted payment or goods</strong>. <br>
  <br>
  Here the goods are over $500 because the tuxedo costs &quot;$519.95&quot; And Al is not a merchant as shown above.<br>
  <br>
  Futhere, this was a &quot;ready-made&quot; tuxedo, not custom made, and Al never acknowledged the contract in a legal setting or accepted the goods.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, a writing <strong>signed by Al </strong>is needed if the contract is to be enforced against him by Bob. </li>
  <li>Under the Statute of Frauds a contract that necessarily takes more than a year to complete from the time of formation must be in writing to be enforceable by law. But if an oral agreement that fails to satisfy the statute is partially or fully performed, it may be enforceable at equity to the extent necessary to prevent injustice. To plead equity one must have &quot;clean hands&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    Here the contract would necessarily take more than a year because it was entered &quot;two days before&quot; Al was 17 and it was to last untill he was over &quot;18&quot;. That is more than a year.<br>
    <br>
  Therefore, the Statute of Frauds required  a writing even if Article 1 of UCC did not. Al only agreed to the contract orally, so and <strong>the contract was not enforceable against him at law because it was oral</strong>. <br>
  <br>
  Further, Tom would be unable to plead &quot;clean hands&quot; because he approves to have taken advantage of Al, a minor, and to have lied to Decra about Al's age.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, Tom would be unable to enforce the oral agreement against Al at either law or equity.
  </li>
  <li>Under the Statute of Frauds a contract that necessarily takes more than a year to complete from the time of formation must be in writing to be enforceable by law.<br>
    <br>
    Here, Tom sent Al a &quot;signed&quot; confirmation that &quot;gave all the details&quot;. 
  And Al also has &quot;performed completely&quot;.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore 
  there may be sufficient &quot;writing&quot; signed by Tom that the Statute of Frauds might be satisfied. Otherwise Al would probably be able to force the contract against Tom at equity to the extent necessary to avoid injustice.</li>
