<p><strong>Types of Contracts</strong></p>
<p>After above discussion, try to find out the type of contract question, there are 6 types of contract questions and / or mixes of all 6 types</p>
<p><strong>Type 1: Formation of Contracts - Questions?</strong></p>
<p>If questions says, a valid contract is formed, then don't discuss formation of contract.</p>
<p><strong>Raise issues of whether contract ever formed at all.</strong><br>
  Was there an OFFER?<br>
  ACCEPTANCE?<br>
  Manifestation of INTENT?<br>
  Was the contract for a LEGAL PURPOSE?<br>
  Supported by CONSIDERATION?<br>
  Between parties with LEGAL Capacity?</p>
<p>For formation of contract, go through each communication between the parties one by one addressing these issues in this order.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Was there a valid OFFER?
    <ol>
        <li>Was there manifestation of INTENT?</li>
      <li>Not effectively REVOKED?</li>
      <li>A GENERAL offer?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Was there an ACCEPTANCE of an offer?
    <ol>
        <li>Not REJECTED by offeree?</li>
      <li>A TIMELY acceptance?</li>
      <li>MIRROR IMAGE RULE (CL) ?</li>
      <li>Accepted by SHIPMENT (UCC) ?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What were the TERMS of the contract?
    <ol>
        <li>Is it <strong>unequivocally clear</strong> the offer is for a UNILATERAL contact?</li>
      <li>Certain as to TERMS?</li>
      <li>A DIVISIBILE contract (UCC) ?</li>
      <li>A PRODUCTION or REQUIREMENTS contract (UCC) ?</li>
      <li>Is <strong>timely performance </strong>an express condition or mere covenant?</li>
      <li>Is <strong>personal satisfaction</strong> an express condition or is there just a promise to render <strong>reasonably satisfactory</strong> performance (an implied condition of every contract) ?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Supported by CONSIDERATION? (Watch for MODIFICATION and ILLUSIONARY PROMISE problems)</li>
  <li>Was the contract for a LEGAL PURPOSE? (Omit if not an issue)</li>
  <li>Between parties with LEGAL CAPACITY? (Watch for MINORS)</li>
</ol>
<p>Follow this pattern:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First look at each communication <strong>chronologically</strong> as a <strong>separate issue</strong> to see if it is an <strong>offer</strong>.</li>
  <li>Second, after you find an offer, examine each following communication as a separate issue looking for an acceptance. It often is a rejection and counter-offer.</li>
  <li>Watch out for and apply the mailbox rules to revocations and rejections by mail/fax.</li>
  <li>When you get a valid acceptance to a valid offer, BINGO !, you have a contract. So the <strong>very next single issue</strong> is to determine its <strong>terms</strong>.</li>
  <li>Don't discuss consideration, legal purpose or legal capacity of the parties <strong>unless the facts call for discussion</strong>.
    <ol>
        <li>Remember that consideration is a <strong>bargained for exchange</strong>.</li>
      <li>No <strong>moral obligation</strong></li>
      <li>No <strong>prior consideration</strong></li>
      <li>No promise qualified by a <strong>future decision</strong> to perform.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Type 2: Term Disputes</strong></p>
<p><strong>What were the terms of the contract?</strong><br>
  Sufficiently CERTAIN that a court can enforce?<br>
  Was there a MODIFICATION supported by consideration?<br>
  Is a term or promised performance a MATERIAL CONDITION?<br>
  Is a given term or promise INCLUDED or EXCLUDED from the agreement?</p>
<p>These raise the questions &quot;What were the terms of the contract?&quot; If FORMATION is in doubt, then the TERMS are probably in dispute as well. Look at the total communication and course of dealing between the parties and address these issues:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Was the agreement CERTAIN that a court can enforce it?
    <ol>
        <li>Remember for UCC only the quantity and parties must be certain.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, were the subject matter, time, price, quantity and parties certain?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Was there a MODIFICATION that was ineffective because unsupported by consideration? Remember this does not apply the UCC question!</li>
  <li>Does the PAROLE EVIDENCE RULE exclude extrinsic evidence? (Remember the mnemonic DAM FOIL!)</li>
</ol>
<p>There are <strong>three situations </strong>where the parties dispute the terms. Usually this is <strong>only one issue </strong>and it will be one of the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Is the contract<strong> too uncertain</strong> to be enforced?
    <ol>
        <li>No quantity stated? (Not a UCC <strong>requirements</strong> or <strong>production</strong> contract)</li>
      <li>Parties uncertain?</li>
      <li>Uncertain as to time, price, subject matter? (Not UCC where <strong>gap fillers</strong> apply)<br>
            <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Is the <strong>modification</strong> supported by adequate consideration?
    <ol>
        <li>Prior Obligation?</li>
      <li>This does not apply to UCC where no considerations is needed?<br>
            <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Does the <strong>parole evidence rule</strong> bar extrinsic evidence of additional terms?
    <ol>
        <li>Merger clause?</li>
      <li>Contract complete within the four corners of the document?</li>
      <li>Remember the <strong>exceptions</strong> (mnemonic = DAM FOIL)<br>
            <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Was <strong>time performance</strong> an EXPRESS CONDITION (material condition) or just a COVENANT (not a material condition)?</li>
  <li>Was <strong>personal satisfaction</strong> an EXPRESS CONDITION (a material condition that the buyer must actually be satisfied) or just a COVENANT (an expression of the implied condition inherent in all contracts that performance must be &quot;reasonably satisfactory&quot;)?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Type 3: Anticipatory Breach Questions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Focus on the issue of who breached first?</strong><br>
  Anticipatory Breach?<br>
  Major or Minor Breach?<br>
  Waiver?</p>
<p>These raise the questions, &quot;Who breached first?&quot; There are two kinds of breach, either <strong>breaches in fact</strong> or <strong>anticipatory repudiation</strong>. </p>
<p>A breach in fact means that <strong>party did not perform</strong> at the time they were supposed to perform.</p>
<p>An anticipatory repudiation means that a party <strong>clearly</strong> states an <strong>intent or inability</strong> to perform at some time in the <strong>future</strong>.</p>
<p>For anticipatory breach questions <strong>look at each communication</strong> between the parties one by one until you find the <strong>first clear breach</strong>. Remember, only one party can breach a contract at a time. Once the first party breaches, the other party CANNOT breach unless the contract is &quot;reformed&quot; by waiver or accord of a good faith dispute.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Was there an ANTICIPATORY REPUDIATION - a clear statement of intent not to perform a future obligation?</li>
  <li>Was there a WAIVER of the anticipatory breach?</li>
  <li>Was there an ACCORD AND SATISFACTION of a good faith dispute?</li>
  <li>Was timely performance an express condition or mere covenant?</li>
  <li>Was personal satisfaction an express condition or is there just a promise to render reasonably satisfactory performance (an implied condition of every contract)?</li>
</ol>
<p>These situations are where one party says, &quot;I don't think I can meet the deadline.&quot; Then the other party says, &quot;Oh yeah? Well then the deal's off. Follow this pattern:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Look at each communication as a <strong>separate issue</strong> to see if it is a <strong>clear statement of intent not to perform at a future time</strong>. If a party says they don't think they will be able to perform in the future, that is expression of a <strong>doubt</strong> and not an expression of an <strong>intent</strong>.</li>
  <li>The<strong> first party</strong> to clearly state an intent to not perform is the breaching party.</li>
  <li>When a party breaches the next issue is the effect of the anticipatory breach. 1) <strong>excuses</strong> the non breaching party from performance and it 2) <strong>accelerates</strong> the performance obligation of the breaching party.</li>
  <li>The <strong>next issue </strong>is whether the non-breaching party <strong>waives the breach</strong> by allowing the breaching party to continue performance under the contract.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Type 4: Defense Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Focus on defense issues:</strong><br>
  Statute of Frauds issue?<br>
  Lack of consideration?<br>
  Illegal purpose?<br>
  Rights of underage party?<br>
  Fraud? Duress?</p>
<p>These raise the following issues:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Does the STATUTE OF FRAUDS (OR UCC 2 - 201 in the case of a sale of goods) require writings?
    <ol>
        <li>Was the need for writing satisfied?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Did the contract (or modification if not a UCC question) lack CONSIDERATION?</li>
  <li>Was the contract for an ILLEGAL purpose (or unconscionable / adhesion contract) ?</li>
  <li>Was the contract voidable by a MINOR or other party lacking capacity?</li>
  <li>Was the contract void because it was the product of FRAUD or DURESS?</li>
  <li>Was the contract void because of MUTUAL MISTAKE?</li>
  <li>Was the contract void because of performance was IMPOSSIBLE or FRUSTRATION OF PURPOSE?</li>
</ol>
<p>If there is a breach, go through each of the breaching party's defenses as separate issues:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First, was there an<strong> insufficient writing</strong> to satisffy the Statute of Frauds?</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of consideration</strong>? Prior obligation? Moral obligation? Prior consideration? Gift promise?</li>
  <li>Illegal purpose? Does <strong>in pare delicto</strong> apply?</li>
  <li>Breaching party a <strong>minor</strong> or <strong>incapacitated</strong>? But, did they repudiate within time after removal of incapacity?</li>
  <li>Contract induced by <strong>fraud</strong>, <strong>duress</strong>, or because of <strong>mistake</strong>? Did the non-breaching party know, or should they have known that the other party was mistaken?</li>
  <li><strong>Performance impossible</strong> or <strong>purpose frustrated</strong>? Was it absolutely impossible? These situations violate IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITIONS of the contract, causing it to fail.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Type 5: Third Party Questions</strong></p>
<p>These raise the question, &quot;Who has the right to enforce?&quot;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Were there THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES?</li>
  <li>Was there a VALID ASSIGNMENT?</li>
  <li>Was there a VALID DELEGATION?</li>
</ol>
<p>These are similar to defenses, and the isuses raised are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Does the third party have standing to braing an action? Intended beneficiary?</li>
  <li>Was there an improper assignment of the contract? Notice not given?</li>
  <li>Was there an improper delegation of the contract? Personal services?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Type 6: Remedy Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Raise issues of what each party can recover and how.</strong><br>
  Specific Performance<br>
  Restitution (quantum meruit concepts)?<br>
  Right to Cure?<br>
  Cover?<br>
  Failure to Mitigate?<br>
  Estoppel?<br>
  Saving Doctrines?</p>
<p>These raise the question, &quot;What remedy does each party have?&quot; </p>
<ol>
  <li>Does a party get time to CURE (UCC)?</li>
  <li>What are the UCC remedies (COVER, REJECT, etc)?</li>
  <li>Did the non-breaching party FAIL TO MITIGATE damages?</li>
  <li>Was there SUBSTANTIAL PERFORMANCE (a MINOR breach) or MAJOR breach?</li>
  <li>Can a party obtain SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE?</li>
  <li>Can the non breaching party get CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (LOST PROFITS)?
    <ol>
        <li>Cite Hadley v. Baxendale</li>
      <li>Remember the mnemonic CCCC.</li>
      <li>Were lost profits <strong>Contemplated</strong> by the parties at time of execuation?</li>
      <li>Were lost profits <strong>Caused</strong> by the breach?</li>
      <li>Were lost profits <strong>Certain</strong> as to amounts?</li>
      <li>Was the lost profits something that <strong>Couldn't</strong> be avoided.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Do the SAVING DOCTRINES of the unilateral contract apply?</li>
  <li>If there is NO VALID ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT can the parties obtain EQUITABLE RELIEF?</li>
  <li>Can promises be enforced based on ESTOPPEL?</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of the remedies is a separtate issue. Only discuss the issues that apply.</p>
<ol>
  <li>If there was a valid contract, was there <strong>substantial performance</strong>? Benefit of bargain.</li>
  <li>Can the plaintiff obtain <strong>specific performance</strong>? Unique goods?</li>
  <li>Can the contract be enforced based on <strong>promissory estoppel</strong>? Injustice resulting?</li>
  <li>Can the party obtain <strong>rescission</strong> and <strong>restitution</strong>? Return to status quo?</li>
  <li>Should the damages be reduced because of a failure to mitigate?</li>
  <li>Are <strong>consequential damages</strong> called for? Cite Hadly v Baxendale, and the mnemonic is CCCC.</li>
  <li>If there is NO VALID, ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT what EQUITABLE remedies is available to the parties?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>A0. Always start the contract Question with following statements:</strong></p>
<p>The rights and remedies of the parties here depend on whether they had a valid contract. A contract is a promise or set of promises the performance of which the law will recognize as a duty and for the breach of which the law will provide a remedy.</p>
<p>A valid contract is based on offer, acceptance and consideration for legal purpose between the parties of legal capacity.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>A1. Does UCC apply?</strong></p>
<p>UCC Article 2 governs contracts for the <strong>sale</strong> of <strong>GOODS</strong>. <strong>GOODS</strong> are <strong>movable</strong> things at the time of identification of the contract.</p>
<p><strong>Example Template</strong></p>
<p>Here the quesiton involves a sale of &quot;widgets&quot; and they are clearly movable because they were to be &quot;delivered&quot;.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Here the contract is not for a sale of goods because it is a contract for personal services i.e. building a house</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>Article 2 of UCC applies</strong> / <strong>only the COMMON LAW applies</strong>.</p>
<p>These are sales of GOODS: 1) used cars, boats, stereos, RVs for <u>sale</u>; 2) firewood, harvested grain, cows; 3) "cut" flowers, "cut" Christmas trees; 4) "widgets", "gadgets" and "flibits" (if they are to be delivered); 5) carpet, even if installation is included</p>
<p>These are NOT SALES OF GOODS:  1) houses, land; 2) boats, cars and furniture <u>for rent;</u> 3) standing crops, the <u>right to cut</u> firewood; 4) growing flowers, the <u>right to cut down</u> and take a Christmas tree; 5) stocks, bonds, contracts, copyrights, patents; 6) building structures, even if materials are included; 7) <u>leased</u> equipment</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>A2. </strong><strong> STATUTE OF FRAUDS</strong></p>
<p>Mnemonic for Statute of Frauds is MYLEG. Contracts can be written if they are </p>
<ol>
  <li>a contract for marriage</li>
  <li>a contract that must take more than a year to complete (from date of execution)</li>
  <li>a contract for conveyence of an interest in Land (e.g rental agreements, sales, easements)</li>
  <li>a contract by an Executor of the estate of a deceased, and</li>
  <li>a contract by a Gurantor of a debt</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Common Law</strong><br>
<strong><br>
Issue:</strong> Need for a WRITING?<br>
<strong><br>
Rule:</strong> Under the Statute of Frauds, certain types of contracts must be written in order to be enforced.<br>
[This is always an issue if the contract is described as &quot;oral&quot; because the reader is saying &quot;oral contract&quot; to prompt discussion of this issue. Probably not an issue and not worth discussing if the contract is described as &quot;written&quot;.]<br>
<br>
<strong>Analysis:</strong> One type of contract that requires a writing is a contract for ....<br>
[Pick the following category that applies to your question ...]</p>
<ol>
  <li>Contracts that necessarily take more than a <strong>Year from execution to completion</strong>.</li>
  <li>Contracts for conveyance of interests in <strong>land</strong> or</li>
  <li>Contracts for <strong>Guarantee</strong> of a debt.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here a writing is needed because this is a contract for &quot;marriage&quot; [or land, gurantee of debt, etc.]</p>
<p>Note: If your exam question is of a type that DOES NOT require a writing, and no facts suggest that it might be, you might just say this:</p>
<p>Here no writing is needed because this contract is not of a type falling under the Statute of Frauds. Therefore, there was (not) a need for a writing in order for the agreement to be legally enforced as a contract, and the requirement is (not) met because ....</p>
<p><strong>More Examples of SOF:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>CL: Under the Statute of Frauds, certain types of contracts must be in writing to be enforced. A contract for conveyance of an interest in LAND often requires a writing, but not leaseholds of year or less.<br>
    <br>
    Here the question involves conveyance of an interest in land because the alleged agreement was to rent a 'house', but this appears to be a month to month rental.<br>
    <br>
  Therefore, a writing would not generally be required.</li>
  <li>UCC: Under <strong>UCC 2-201</strong> a contract for the <strong>sale</strong> of GOODS <strong>over $500</strong> requires a writing. This limit is being raised to $5,000 but many States are still using $500 limit. Under the UCC a contract between MERCHANTS may satisfy the need for a writing against both parties if there is a<strong> sales confirmation </strong>indicating the quantity sent to one party by the other and the receiving party <strong>does not object</strong> to the representation ofa contract.<br>
    <br>
  Further, under the UCC there is no need for a writing if goods are <strong>custom made</strong>, the person to be bound <strong>acknowledge the contract</strong> in a legal setting or where a party has <strong>accepted payment or goods</strong>. <br>
  <br>
  Here the goods are over $500 because the tuxedo costs &quot;$519.95&quot; And Al is not a merchant as shown above.<br>
  <br>
  Futhere, this was a &quot;ready-made&quot; tuxedo, not custom made, and Al never acknowledged the contract in a legal setting or accepted the goods.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, a writing <strong>signed by Al </strong>is needed if the contract is to be enforced against him by Bob. </li>
  <li>Under the Statute of Frauds a contract that necessarily takes more than a year to complete from the time of formation must be in writing to be enforceable by law. But if an oral agreement that fails to satisfy the statute is partially or fully performed, it may be enforceable at equity to the extent necessary to prevent injustice. To plead equity one must have &quot;clean hands&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    Here the contract would necessarily take more than a year because it was entered &quot;two days before&quot; Al was 17 and it was to last untill he was over &quot;18&quot;. That is more than a year.<br>
    <br>
  Therefore, the Statute of Frauds required  a writing even if Article 1 of UCC did not. Al only agreed to the contract orally, so and <strong>the contract was not enforceable against him at law because it was oral</strong>. <br>
  <br>
  Further, Tom would be unable to plead &quot;clean hands&quot; because he approves to have taken advantage of Al, a minor, and to have lied to Decra about Al's age.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, Tom would be unable to enforce the oral agreement against Al at either law or equity.  </li>
  <li>Under the Statute of Frauds a contract that necessarily takes more than a year to complete from the time of formation must be in writing to be enforceable by law.<br>
    <br>
    Here, Tom sent Al a &quot;signed&quot; confirmation that &quot;gave all the details&quot;. 
  And Al also has &quot;performed completely&quot;.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore 
  there may be sufficient &quot;writing&quot; signed by Tom that the Statute of Frauds might be satisfied. Otherwise Al would probably be able to force the contract against Tom at equity to the extent necessary to avoid injustice.</li>
  <li>Under the Statute of Frauds certain types of contracts must be in writing to be enforced. A contract for conveyance of an<strong> interest in LAND</strong> generally requires a writing, and contracts that necessarily must take <strong>more than a year</strong> to complete require a writing. <br>
    <br>
  Here the contract is for building a house, and doe not involve conveyance of an interst in land because Homere &quot;already owns&quot; the land. And the contract can be performed in less than a year because it was to be completed before the &quot;Winter rains&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
  Therefore, no writing is required by Statute of Frauds.</li>
  <li>Under the Statute of Frauds certain types of contracts must be in writing to be enforced. A contract for transfer of stock is not one of them.<br>
    <br>
  Therefore, no writing is required by the Statute of Frauds.</li>
  <li>UCC: Under <strong>UCC 2-201</strong> a contract for the <strong>sale</strong> of GOODS <strong>over $500</strong> requires a writing. This limit is being raised to $5,000 but many States are still using $500 limit. <br>
   <br>
     In a contract between MERCHANT the need for a writing may be satisfied by a<strong> sales confirmatio</strong>n indicating the quantity sent to one party by the other if the receiving party has reason to know the contents of the writing and does not object to the representation of a contract withing 10 days.   <br>
     <br>
  Here a writing is needed because the cost of the goods is $60,000 (&quot;10,000&quot; at &quot;$6&quot;). But this is &quot;between merchants&quot; because both parties appear to be merchants, and the 6/4 sales confirmation Sellco sent to Buyco specifies quantity at &quot;10, 000&quot;. That satisfies the requirement of 2-201.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>A3. FORMATION OF CONTRACT ISSUES </strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Offer on [date]? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Def:</strong> Under contract law, OFFER is a <strong>manifestation</strong> of present contractual <strong>intent</strong> <strong>communicated</strong> to the offeree and sufficiently certain as to terms that an objective person would reasonably <strong>believe assent</strong> would form a bargain.</p>
<p><strong>Def:</strong> Under common law, an offer must specify the parties, subject matter, quantity, price, and time of performance in order to be enforceable.</p>
<p><strong>Def:</strong> Under UCC, an offer is sufficiently certain if it specifies the parties and quantity, and UCC &quot;GAP Fillers&quot; may be used to determine additional terms.</p>
<p>Here the communication was (not) an offer because ... Therefore, the communication was (not) an offer.</p>
<p>Watch out for catalog and advertisements, Catalogues are never offers because quantity is always uncertain. Advertisements are seldom offers because either quantity is not set or else the offeree is not described. Also watch out for gift promises and exchanges of gift promises because they never manifest contractual intent. They are not enforceable at law, only at equity may be.</p>
<p>If saying &quot;OK&quot; to a communication would NOT make an observer reasonably believe an enforceable contract formed, then the communication &quot;assented to&quot; was not even an offer.</p>
<p>Examples: </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Was the ADVERTISEMENT an OFFER?</strong></p>
    <p>Under contract law an OFFER is a <strong>manifestation of present intent </strong>to enter into a bargain <strong>communicated</strong> to the offeree and sufficiently specific that an observer would reasonably believe assent would form a bargain. Advertisements are generally not offers because they usually fail to identity the parties or the quantity being offered. </p>
    <p>Here the advertisement was <strong>not specific</strong> as to the parties because it did not guarantee that Lucy would rent to the first person to respond. </p>
    <p>Therefore, the advertisement was not an offer. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Was the 9:00 statement by Homer an OFFER?</strong></p>
    <p>Offer is defined supra</p>
    <p>Here the statement by Homer did not appear to <strong>manifest intent</strong> to enter into a bargain because  even though he said, &quot;I accept&quot; he added that he &quot;had to see the house first&quot;. No reasonable person would believe assent to that statement would form a bargain because it was clear he wanted to &quot;see the house first&quot;. </p>
    <p>Therefore the statement was not an offer.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Was the 9.00 response by Lucy an OFFER?</strong></p>
    <p>Offer is defined supra</p>
    <p>Here the statement by Lucy did  manifest intent to enter into a bargain because she said &quot;It's a deal, I will rent to you for $550.&quot; A reaonable person would believe assent to that statment  would form a bargain.</p>
    <p>Therefore that statement was an offer.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Sample 7 - Was the catalogue an OFFER?<br>
    </strong><br>
    Under contract law an OFFER is a manifestation of present contractual intent communicated to the offeree that is so specific that an objective observer would reasonably believe assent would form a bargain. An advertisement is never a valid offer unless it clearly identifies the QUANTITY of goods for sale and the PARTY to whom the offeror is willing to sell them.<br>
  <br>
    Here the catalogue is not an offer because it is just a price list that does not specify the quantity of any product Sellco is willing to sell. No reasonable person would believe merely ‘assenting’ to the catalogue would alone form a bargain, so a catalogue cannot be an ‘offer’..<br>
  <br>
    Therefore, the catalogue itself is not an offer. <br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Sample 7 - 6/2/99 OFFER by Buyco?</strong><br>
    <br>
    Offer is defined above.<br>
  <br>
    Here the communication from Buyco expresses present contractual intent because it says “we hereby accept”. The offer is specific as to parties because it says “we” and “your”, and it is specific as to a quantity of “10,000”. This is specific enough for an offer because it objectively appears assent would form a bargain.<br>
  <br>
    Therefore, this is a valid offer.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><strong>2. Was it an offer for a UNILATERAL CONTRACT?</strong></p>
<p>NOTE: Skip unless the given facts make it entirely clear this is an intended issue or the offer is General Offer.</p>
<p><strong>Def:</strong> Under a common law, a UNILATERAL CONTRACT OFFER is one that unequivocally indicates acceptance can only be manifested by completion of performance by the offeree.</p>
<p>General Offers, reward, bounty offers are always unitlateral contract offers.</p>
<p>Here it is (not) unequivocally clear that the offere can only accept this offer by completion of performance because... Therefore this is (not) a unilateral contract offer.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sample 6 - UNILATERAL CONTRACT? </strong></p>
    <p>Under contract law a UNILATERAL CONTRACT is proposed by an offer that unequivocally requires acceptance by performance and cannot be accepted merely by a promise of performance. </p>
    <p>Here this offer unequivocally required Dottie to "actually take care of " Fester for the rest of his life because Fester &ldquo;emphasized&rdquo; Dottie could not accept by merely &ldquo;promising&rdquo; to do what he asked. </p>
    <p>Therefore, this was an offer of a unilateral contract.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Sample 6 - SAVING DOCTRINES of a UNILATERAL CONTRACT?</strong><br>
    <br>Under the common law an offeror could revoke her offer at any time before acceptance. Under that view Fester could revoke at any time, leaving Dottie without a remedy. Modernly SAVING DOCTRINES have been adopted to prohibit the offeror of a unilateral contract from revoking for a reasonable time after becoming aware that the offeree has begun performance in acceptance.<br><br>Under an alternative view the offeror may revoke but the offeree has a right to RESTITUTION to
avoid UNJUST ENRICHMENT.<br><br>Here Dottie <strong>began performance</strong> in acceptance because she "sold her home", "moved" and "nursed Fester." And Fester was <strong>aware</strong> of her performance because he was alert despite his paralysis.<br><br>Therefore, under the modern savings doctrines Dottie would usually be given a reasonable time to complete performance. Here a "reasonable time" is the rest of Fester's life, since that was the condition of the offer.
  <br>

</ol>
<p><strong>3. Was the communication (action) of [date] an (implied) ACCEPTANCE?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Only for a formation question. Skip if question says there was an agreement or contract.</p>
<p><strong>Def:</strong> Under the common law MIRROR IMAGE RULE an acceptance is an <strong>unequivocal assent to an offer</strong>.</p>
<p>However, acceptance can be implied by silent performance.</p>
<p>Here the communication was (not) an acceptance because ... Therefore, a CONTRACT WAS FORMED on [date]. [Or else the communication was a REJECTION AND COUNTER-OFFER on different terms.]</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In a formation question, if a contract is formed under the common law (not the UCC), it can ONLY be determined by the analysis of the offer that was accepted - that is the only thing that can determine the terms under common law. A UNILATERAL CONTRACT can only be accepted by performing the actions requested by the offeror. But modern contract law provides SAVING DOCTRINES when unilateral offers are revoked before performance is complete.</p>
<p><strong>4. Had the OFFER LAPSED before acceptance?</strong></p>
<p>Note: This issue is frequently tested and poorly taught. Pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Under common law an offer LAPSES AND CANNOT BE ACCEPTED unless it is accepted in a <strong>reasonable preiod</strong> of time. Oral offers are deemed to lapse at the end of the conversation, and written offers are deemed to lapse within the timeframe implied by the means of dispatch, absent contrary agreement or implication.</p>
<p>Here the offer was oral (by fax, telegraph, mail, etc) so it would be deemed to have lapsed when ... Therefore the offer did (not) lapse before the offeree attempted to accept it.</p>
<p><strong>5. Was the communication of (action) an EFFECTIVE ACCEPTANCE?</strong></p>
<p>Note: Skip if question says there was an agreement or contract. This is only a possible issue if there is an &quot;acceptance&quot; by &quot;dispatch&quot; that conflicts with some communication of rejection or revocation.</p>
<p>Under the MAILBOX RULES of the common law an acceptance is effective when dispatched, if dispatched in the<strong> manner specified</strong> in the offer, or by the <strong>same or faster means</strong> the offere was transmitted where the offer does not specify a means of communication.</p>
<p>Here the acceptance was (not) effective upon dispatch (receipt) because it was (not) sent by the means specified in the offer (no means was specified in the offer and it was sent at the same or faster means than the offer had been sent). Therefore ...</p>
<p>Note: a unilateral contract offer can only be accepted by the requested performance, but NEVER assume the offer is for a unilateral contract offer unless it is unequivocal, Further, modern contract law provides SAVING DOCTRINES as stated below.</p>
<p><strong>6. Was the communication of [date] an EFFECTIVE REJECTION?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Only for a formation question, SKIP if not applicable.</p>
<p>Under the MAILBOX RULES of contract law a rejection is effective upon receipt while an acceptance may be effective upon dispatch. An EXCEPTION is made if the OFFEROR CHANGES POSITION in relieance upon a communication of rejection, not knowing that an acceptance was dispatched prior to receipt of the rejection. In that case the rejection is effective upon receipt regardless of the fact an acceptance was also dispatched.</p>
<p>Here the rejection was (not) effective because...</p>
<p>Here the offeror (did not) change position in reliance on the rejection because ...</p>
<p>Therefore...</p>
<p><strong>7. Was the communication of [date] an     EFFECTIVE REVOCATION?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Only for a formation question, SKIP if not applicable.</p>
<p>Under the common law MAILBOX RULES revocation of a contract offer is usually effective upon receipt by the offeree, and an offer <strong>cannot be revoked after acceptance</strong>.</p>
<p>For an unequivocal unilateral offer also say, as appropriate,</p>
<p>Here the offeror was aware the offeree had commenced the requested act because .. and the revocation was (was not) effective because ... Therefore...</p>
<p>Under the common law a unilateral offer could be revoked at any time. Revocation of GENERAL OFFERS, reward or bouty offers are only effective when published in the same manner the offer was first announced.</p>
<p>Modernly SAVING DOCTRINES prevent revocation of a unilateral contract offer after the offeror is <strong>aware the offeree has commenced</strong> the requested act for a <strong>reasonable period </strong>during which the offeree must be allowed to complete acceptance by performance.</p>
<p>Here ... therefore...</p>
<p><strong>8. Was there an IMPLIED-IN-FACT CONTRACT?</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law an IMPLIED-IN-FACT CONTRACT will be deemed to have existed, even if there is no express agreement between the parties, if <strong>one party acts to bestow benefits</strong> on the other party <strong>reasonably expecting to be compensated</strong>, and the <strong>other party knowingly accepts those benefits</strong> knowing that the other party expects to be compensated.</p>
<p>An implied-in-fact contract is an actual, legal contract. The party that knowingly receives the benefits is liable for a reasonable contract amount to the other party.</p>
<p>Here.. because .... Therefore...</p>
<p><strong>9. Need for a Writing?</strong></p>
<p>Explained above in A2.</p>
<p><strong>10. Consideration?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Def:</strong> Under contrac law, consideration is a <strong>bargained for exchange</strong> posing sufficient <strong>legal detriment</strong> that the law will enforce the agreement.</p>
<p><strong>MBE for Consideration?</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Carl and Homer entered into a valid written contract under which Carl agreed to build a house on Homer's lot. Homer agreed to pay $150,000 for the house. The contract stated: &quot;Homer's duty to pay shall not arise unless and until the house is constructed in full compliance with the attached specifications.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Assume that during his vacation, Homer voluntarily spent two days helping Carl construct the house. At the end of the second day, Carl mentioned the fact that he had an antique weathervane and Homer said he would like to buy it. Carl stated:  &quot;You 've already done enough for me. I'll give the weathervane to you and install it tomorrow.&quot; Homer said: &quot;Thanks a lot.&quot; When Carl refused to deliver or install the weathervane, Homer sued.<br>
    <br>
    The principal question for the court is whether: &quot;<strong>Homer's voluntary work was sufficient consideration for Carl's promise to give Homer the weathervane.</strong>&quot;</li>

<p><strong>A4. TERMS OF CONTRACT </strong></p>
<p>1. CONTRACT TERMS?</p>
<p>Note: Immediately after discussing accetpance.</p>
<p>Under common law an enforceable contract has to include the <strong>parties</strong>, the <strong>price</strong>, the <strong>subject matter,</strong> the <strong>time of performance</strong> and the <strong>quantity</strong>. </p>
<p>Most express terms and promises are considered to be EXPRESS MATERIAL CONDITIONS, except for TIME of performance, buyer SATISFACTION, and promises NOT TO ASSIGN the contract which are generally considered mere &quot;covenants&quot;.</p>
<p>Here the PARTIES to the contract were ... the QUANTITY was... the PRICE was ..., SUBJECT MATTER was ... and TIME OF PERFORMANCE was ...</p>
<p>Therefore, the contract was (not) specified enough to be enforceable.</p>
<p><strong>2. Was TIMELY PERFORMANCE a MATERIAL CONDITION?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is frequently tested and poorly taught. This is never a UCC issue because under the Perfect Tender Rule tardy performance is always a breach.</p>
<p>Under contract law the parties may agree at the time of contract execution that timely performance (by the party to first perform contract services) is a MATERIAL CONDITION. Then the condition is called an EXPRESS CONDITION, and typically the contract says, &quot;Time is of the essence&quot;.</p>
<p>But material conditions may also be or <strong>implied</strong> when the <strong>parties knew at the time of execution </strong>that <strong>tardy performance would deny the non-performing party the BENEFIT OF THE BARGAIN</strong>, the benefit expected when they entered into the agreement. In that case the condition is called an IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION.</p>
<p>Here the parties did (note) agree that &quot;time was of the essence&quot;. And tardy performance would (not) deny the non-breaching party the benefit of the bargain .. because ... Therfore ...</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The INTENT of the parties at the time of execution is the court's only concer, NOT the actual EFFECT of tardy execution. If the contract concerns the performance of services that are frequently delayed by weather, transportation delays or other factors beyond the control of the parties the Court will generally assume timely performance was NOT a material condition unless the terms of the contract expressly say it is.</p>
<p><strong>3. Was SATISFACTION a MATERIAL CONDITION?</strong></p>
<p> [This is frequently tested and poorly taught. And this is also never a UCC issue.]</p>
<p>Under contract law reasonable satisfactory performance by the parties is ALWAYS AN IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION of every contract. However, the parties may agree that SATISFACTION of the buyer is a MATERIAL CONDITION so that if buyers are not actually satisfied by the performance of the other parties they have no legal obligation to pay for services.</p>
<p>But if the terms of the agreement do not expressly and unequivocally state that the parties intended for <strong>personal</strong> satisfaction to be a material condition, the Court will generally hold that a promise of &quot;satisfaction&quot; was merely a &quot;covenant&quot; to perform in a manner that would be satisfactory to a &quot;reasonable person&quot; and NOT a material condition. UNLESS the service to be performed was one that is highly subject to personal tastes.</p>
<p>Here the parties did (not) expressly agree that &quot;satisfaction&quot; was a material condition. And the service to be performed was not one that is highly subject to personal tastes. [ <strong>Or else, &quot;But the service to be performed was one that is highly subject to personal tastes.&quot; </strong>] Therefore ....</p>
<p>[<strong>Note: </strong>The types of services that are highly subject to personal tastes are things such as portrait photographs and artistic renderings. Otherwise, a Court is generally going to interpret a promise of “satisfaction” to mean a promise (covenant) to perform in a manner satisfactory to a reasonable person, absent express, unequivocal language to the contrary in the contract.]&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Does the PAROL EVIDENCE RULE bar evidence of other covenants and terms?</strong></p>
<p>[This is only an issue if there is a <strong>detailed written contract</strong>. This and the Statute of Frauds can never both be issues in the same fact pattern because usually the contract can only be either written or oral, not both at the same time. The only exception is when a written contract is later orally modified.]

&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the PAROL EVIDENCE RULE evidence of PRIOR or CONTEMPARANEOUS agreements may not be introduced to VARY or CONTRADICT the terms of a FULLY INTEGRATED WRITING unless it is to show evidence of [DAM FOIL] Duress, Ambiguity, Mistake, Fraud, Oral condition precedent, Illegality, or Lack of consideration. The Court may determine the &quot;completeness&quot; of a written contract by examining the comprehensiveness of its contents.</p>
<p>Here ... because .... Therefore....</p>
<p><strong>5. LACK OF INTENT as a defense?</strong></p>
<p>Under the OBJECTIVE MAIN RULE, there is an <strong>intent</strong> to enter into a contract if an <strong>objective observer</strong> of the parties would have <strong>reasonable concluded</strong> assent would form a bargain.</p>
<p>Here an objective observer would (not) have thought the party to be bound intended to form a contract because .... Therefore ...</p>
<p><strong>6. LACK OF CONSIDERATION?</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law every valid contract and any modification of a contract must be supported by CONSIDERATION, a <strong>bargained for exchange</strong> posing sufficient <strong>legal detriment</strong> that the law will enforce the agreement.</p>
<p>Here the promised act was (not) <strong>bargained for</strong> because ... And there was (not) any <strong>legal detriment</strong> to the promisee because he had (did not have) a PRE-EXISTING DUTY to ... Further [party] was (not) totally denied the benefit of the bargain because ...</p>
<p>Therefore, the contract did (not) fail for lack of consideration.</p>
<p><strong>7. Was the need for a WRITING SATISFIED?</strong></p>
<p>Explained above in A2.</p>
<p><strong>8. Was the contract UNCONSIONABLE?</strong></p>
<p>[Never discuss this unless the given facts make it very, very clear it is an intended issue.]</p>
<p>Under contract law an unconscionable contract will not be enforceable because there is NO REASONABLE FINDING OF INTENT to enter such a contract. An ADHESION CONTRACT is a &quot;take it or leave it&quot; contract that a party is forced to agree to, and it will often be found unenforceable.</p>
<p>Here the contract appears to be unconscionable because ... Therefore ...</p>
<p><strong>9. Is DURESS a defense?</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law only good faith agreements are enforceable. Contract agreements induced by illegal threats are not valid. Threats of PHYSICAL duress are always unenforceable, and threats of economic harm are not enforceable if they are inherently illegal (e.g. threats to breach contracts, blackmail) or otherwise are deliberately created by the other party for the purpose of causing economic duress.</p>
<p>Here the contract may be argued to be unconscionable (or the result of duress) because ... Therefore ...</p>
<p> [Duress is rarely a defense in an essay question because it is all too obvious.]</p>
<p><strong>10. FRAUD, CONCEALMENT or LACK OF DISCLOSURE as a contract defense?</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law a contract induced through deliberate MISREPRESENTATION of material facts, or CONCEALMENT of material facts, or a FAILURE TO DISCLOSE material facts by a party with a pre-existing duty to reveal those facts is voidable by the party that was misled.</p>
<p>Here there was (not) fraud because ... Therefore ...</p>
<p>[<strong>Note </strong>that usually parties to contracts do not have any duty to reveal material facts at all. But if the parties have ACTED in a way that causes concealment of the facts, then they have a pre-existing duty to reveal the facts they have concealed. Further, in real estate sales the broadly adopted modern view is that the seller has a duty to reveal all material facts whether they have caused them to be concealed or not.]&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11. Can a DEFENSE of INCAPACITY be raised?</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law a contract cannot be enforced AGAINST one who lacks capacity. EXCEPTIONS are contracts for provision of NECESSITIES of life and where the incapacitated party attains capacity (becomes sane or an adult) and either AFFIRMS or FAILS TO REPUDIATE the contract.</p>
<p>Here the party seeking to avoid the contract was a MINOR (or ADJUDICATED INSANE perhaps) at the time the contract was executed because .... And (But) the contract was not (was) for necessities of life because ... And (But) the party to be bound did (not) ratify the contract because ....</p>
<p>Therefore, this contract could (not) be enforced.</p>
<p><strong>12. ILLEGALITY</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law, a contract generally cannot be enforced by a party who knowingly entered into it for an <strong>illegal purpose</strong>.</p>
<p>But if the parties are not equally guilty, not IN PARL DELICTO, the court may order restitution to the less guilty party. However, if one party is less guilty, the court has discretion to order restitution in equity.</p>
<p>Here ... because ... Therefore ...</p>
<p><strong>13. COMMERCIAL IMPRACTICABILITY?</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law, if performance of a contract becomes so <strong>overwhelmingly expensive and difficult t</strong>o perform that enforcement would be inequitable, the Court (in equity) may excuse the party from further performance.</p>
<p>[This is more of an equitable remedy than a legal defense. The mere fact that performance would be unprofitable is irrelevant. Performance must be so difficult and expensive that it would be unjust for the Court to enforce it.]</p>
<p><strong>14. IMPOSSIBILITY?</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law an <strong>implied material condition</strong> of every contract is that performance must be possible. If performance becomes impossible because of <strong>events beyond the control of the parties</strong> the contract becomes void.</p>
<p>Here ... because ... Therefore ...</p>
<p>[This is often viewed as a "defense" for one of the parties but it really is just a finding by the Court that the contract has become void for failure of a condition. Since the contract is void all subsequent remedies (e.g. restitution) must be in equity.]</p>
<p><strong>15. FRUSTRATION OF PURPOSE?</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law, if a party enters into a contract <strong>knowing the purpose </strong>for which the <strong>other party</strong> is entering the contract, that purpose becomes an <strong>implied material condition</strong> of the contract. If <strong>unforeseen</strong> events beyond the control of the parties frustrate that purpose the condition fails and the contract may be voided by the party whose purpose have been frustrated.</p>
<p>Here ... because ... Therefore ...</p>
<p><strong>16. MUTUAL MISTAKE?</strong></p>
<p>Under PEERLESS if the parties enter into a contract <strong>each with a misunderstanding </strong>that goes to the essence of the agreement, the contract is void from the beginning because there was no &quot;meeting of the minds&quot;.</p>
<p>Here .. because... Therefore...</p>
<p><strong>17. UNILATERAL MISTAKE?</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law, when one party enters into a contract because of a <strong>misunderstanding</strong> as to a <strong>material fact </strong>the majority view is that the parties are legally bound to the contract unless <strong>the other party knew or should have known</strong> of the mistake, and in that case the contract is voidable by the mistaken party.</p>
<p>Under a minority view the contract is legally voidable by the mistaken party in any event if they 1) <strong>discover the mistake quickly</strong> before the other party substantially relies on the contract, 2) give <strong>prompt notice</strong> of the mistake, and 3) <strong>reimburse the other party</strong> for any expenses caused by the mistake.</p>
<p>Here .. because... Therefore...</p>
<p><strong>18. WAIVER of condition?</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law a party may perform a contractual PROMISE that is not a LEGAL DUTY. This may be because the promise was not legally enforceable to begin with or else because it was subject to a condition precedent that has failed or not held. In this case the party has WAIVED THE CONDITION.</p>
<p>But after a conditon has been waived the waving party has a legal right to RETRACT THE WAIVER. Nevertheless, a Court of EQUITY may estop the retraction based on considerations of equitable estoppel.</p>
<p>Here .. because... Therefore...</p>
<p>[<strong>For example</strong>, A and B enter into a written contract that says all modifications must be in writing. But later they orally agree to a modification. They have "waived the condition" of a writing. But either can retract that later and repudiate the modification agreement. In that case a Court (in equity) may estop the party that tries to retract the waiver (repudiate the modification) if it would cause an injustice to the other party. For an explanation of waivers of condition see Nailing the Bar's "Simple Contracts & UCC Outline".]</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>A5. BREACH  </strong></p>
<p><strong>1. ANTICIPATORY BREACH?</strong></p>
<p>Note: If the non-breaching party allows the breaching party to continue performance after the anticipatory breach, either discuss WAIVER OF THE BREACH as an accompanying issue (see below) or else consider skipping this issue altogether.</p>
<p>Under contract law an ANTICIPATORY REPUDIATION is a <strong>clear statement of intent </strong>or other <strong>clear indication</strong> by a party that <strong>they will not perform</strong> a future obligation. An anticipatory repudiation is a MAJOR breach. The effect is to 1) <strong>excuse</strong> the other party from performance and 2) <strong>accelerate</strong> all future obligations of the breaching party to the present. </p>
<p>If a party has a REASONABLE BASIS to believe the other party may not perform future contractual duties, the party may demand REASONABLE ASSURANCES and REFUSE TO PERFORM until they are provided. Reasonable assurances generally means a financial gurantee or payment into escrow.</p>
<p>If reasonable assurances are properly demanded and not provided, the failure to respond constitutes an anticipatory breach.</p>
<p>Here there was (not) an anticipatory breach because the party said &quot;....&quot; and that (did not) make it clear they were not going to perform. That did (not) form a reasonable basis for (the other party) to demand reasonable assurances because ... Therefore.... </p>
<p><strong>2. WAIVER of the breach?</strong></p>
<p>Note: This is an issue when there is an anticipatory breach or other major breach but afterward the non-breaching party lets the breaching party resume or continue performance.</p>
<p>Under contract law if a non-breaching party lets the breaching party continue performance after an anticipatory breach or other major breach it WAIVES THE BREACH (technically this is called an ELECTION). The waiver cannot be revoked, and the non-breaching party is forever ESTOPPED from citing the breach as major and can only cite it as a minor breach.</p>
<p>Here ... because ... Therefore...  </p>
<p><strong>3. BREACH OF IMPLIED COVENANT? </strong>[This is a particular type of breach issue]</p>
<p>An IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION of every contract is that the parties must act in good faith and are bound by an IMPLIED COVENANT that they will <strong>act as a resonably necessary to help the other parties enjoy the benefits of the contract</strong> and <strong>that they will not act in any way to preven that from occuring</strong>.</p>
<p>A breach of GOOD FAITH or acting in &quot;bad faith&quot; means either deceit, concealment or fraud at the time of execution or else the breach of an implied covenant. The mere breach of an express contract promise, even if done deliberetly, is not a breach of good faith.</p>
<p>Here ... because ... Therefore... </p>
<p>[For an explanation of implied material conditions and covenants see Nailing the Bar's "Simple Contracts & UCC Outline".]</p>
<p><strong>4. BREACH of contract ? MAJOR or MINOR? </strong>[The first party to breach is the breaching party and the other party is th enon-breaching party, no matter what the non-breaching party does later!]</p>
<p><strong>Def:</strong> Under contract law a BREACH is a failure to perform a contractual duty when performance is due.</p>
<p>A MAJOR BREACH is either an act which deprives the other party of the BENEFIT OF THE BARGAIN or the violation of an EXPRESS OR IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION by a party, regardless of its effect on the other party. A major breach EXCUSES the non-breaching party from all futher performances of contractual duties and ACCELERATES the future contractual duties of the breaching party to the present so the non-breaching party can seek IMMEDIATE PAYMENT OF DAMAGES.</p>
<p>Otherwise a breach is MINOR and there has been SUBSTANTIAL PERFORMANCE giving the non-breaching party the <strong>benefit of the bargain</strong>. In that case the non-breaching party is required to pay the contract price LESS AN OFFSET for <strong>compensatory damages</strong>.</p>
<p>[Usually one party (Payer) promises to pay for performance by the other party (Performer), but Payer's promise is subject to the CONSTRUCTIVE CONDITION Performer must complete performance as promised. So if Performer breaches (fails to perform as promised), Payer's promise to pay NEVER RIPENS into a DUTY to pay. If a Court determines that Performer has substantially performed, the constructive condition is EXCUSED and Payer's promise to pay ripens into a duty to pay. But at the same time the Court will award Payer an OFFSET for the damages caused by Performer's breach (if any).]</p>
<p><strong>5. ACCORD AND SATISFACTION?</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law an ACCORD AND SATISFACTION is an agreement by the contract parties <strong>to settle</strong> a <strong>reasonable</strong> and<strong> good faith</strong> claim of breach by one of the parties. It is binding on both parties. </p>
<p>The knowing acceptance by one party of any payment or other offer to settle a contract dispute by the other party is generally binding on both parties, even if the party accepting payment says they do so &quot;under protest&quot; or &quot;reserving their claim&quot; or some statement of that type. </p>

  <li>Carl and Homer entered into a valid written contract under which Carl agreed to build a house on Homer's lot. Homer agreed to pay $150,000 for the house. The contract stated: &quot;Homer's duty to pay shall not arise unless and until the house is constructed in full compliance with the attached specifications.&quot;<br>
    <br>
  Assume that shortly after commencing performance Carl called Homer and said that the 1/2 inch rods for the foundation required in the specifications were in short supply, but that 1/4 inch rods were readily available. Homer replied: &quot;Go ahead and use the 1/4 th inch.&quot; One day later, before Carl had bought or installed the rods, Homer called and stated that Carl Must use the 1/2 inch rods. Carl refused to do so. <br>
  <br>
  The best analysis of the parties legal rights is: <strong>&quot;Homer waived his right to have 1/2 inch rods, but he has retracted the waiver so that Carl must use 1/2 inch rods.</strong>&quot;<br>

<p><strong>A6. THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY contract?</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law a THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY contract is one betwen a promisee who promises to give something of value to a promisor in exchange for the promisor's promise to do something to benefit a third party, the INTENDED THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY. If the purpose of the promisee are gratuitous, the third party beneficiary is called a DONEE BENEFICARY. If the promisee is acting to satisfy a legal obligation, the third party beneficiary is called a CREDITOR BENEFICIARY.</p>
<p>Promisors that breach third party beneficiary contracts are legally liable to both the promisees and all intended beneficiaries. Promisees that breach third party beneficiary contracts are legally liable to promisors and creditor beneficiaries but NOT to donee beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Under early common law parties that breached third party beneficiary contracts were only legally liable to intended beneficiaries that were VESTED because they had been <strong>aware of the existence of the contract and had relied on it</strong> before the breach occured. Modernly that requirement has been adandoned.</p>
<p>Donee beneficiaries can only seek a remedy against breaching <strong>promisees</strong> in EQUITY based on a claim of DETRIMENTAL RELIANCE.</p>
<p>When contrats would incidentally benefit third parties, but their benefit was not the purpose of the contracts, the third parties are called INCIDENTAL BENEFICIARIES. Parties that breach contracts have no liability to <strong>incidental</strong> beneficiaries in law or equity.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Third party questions require that you identify the parties and explain all of the rights and liabilites each party has against th eother parties. That usually takes so much time that there is little time left for anything else.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sample 3 (pg 8) Groucho's rights under a THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY CONTRACT?</strong><br>
    <br>
    Under contract law a THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY CONTRACT is one with main <strong>purpose</strong> of providing a <strong>benefit to a thrid party</strong>. The contract can be enforced by the original party, the promisee, or by a vested intended beneficiary.  <br>
    <br>
  A beneficiary may be a DONEE (of a gift) or a CREDITOR (payment of debt) beneficiary. The beneficiary <strong>vests</strong> upon becoming aware of and changing position in reliance on the contract. <br>
  <br>
  Here the <strong>purpose</strong> of the contract is to <strong>benefit</strong> Chico because he was to get a &quot;new Dodge&quot; as a &quot;birthday present.&quot; Therefore this is a third-party benefit contract. Chico is intended DONEE beneficiary because it is a &quot;birthday present&quot;.<br>
  <br>
  Groucho is the promisee because Harpo promised to &quot;deliver&quot; the car in &quot;two weeks&quot;. Harpo is the <strong>promisor</strong> because he has promised to deliver the car to Chico. <br>
  <br>
  Therefore, this is a third-party beneficiary contract, and Groucho as promisee can enforce it. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Groucho's REMEDIES?</strong><br>
  <br>
  Under the PERFECT TENDER RULE of the UCC a non-breaching buyer in a non-delivery situation can demand conforming goods, repudiate the contract or by goods to cover and demand the excess of the cover price over the contract price. <br>
  <br>
  Here Harpo has breached because he did not deliver the promised car.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, Groucho can demand delivery from Harpo or repudiate the contract and demand return of his $2,000. If he covers by buying the car elsewhere he can demand the excess of his cover price, if any, over the contract price.<br>
  <br>

      <li><strong>CHICO V. HARPO </strong>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Chico's rights as a THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY?</strong><br>
            <br>
            Third party beneficiary contracts are defined above. Chico is an intended third-party beneficiary because the known purpose of the original contract was to give him a &quot;birthday present&quot;. He vested when he became aware of the original contract and changed position in reliance.<br>
            <br>
            A vested third-party beneficiary can enforce the contract against the promisor in the same manner as the promisee.<br>
            <br>
          Therefore, Chico can enforce the original contract against Harpo in the same manner and extent as Groucho.<br>
          <br>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Chico's REMEDIES</strong><br>
            <br>
            Chico's remedies would be the same as Groucho. <br>
            <br>
            </li>

      <li><strong>CHICO V. SWIFTY</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>Chico's rights and remedies against Swifty?</strong><br>
        <br>
      Since Swifty agreed to perform the duties of Harpo, Swifty assumed the same liability as Harpo. And since Chico has the same enforcement rights as Groucho, Chico's rights and remedies to enforce the contract against Swifty are the same as against Harpo. <br>
      <br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>CHICO V. GROUCHO</strong><br>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Chico's rights and remedies against Groucho?</strong><br>
            <br>
            A donee beneficiary cannot enforce the promise of a gift against the promisee at law and can only enforce at equity based on promissory estoppel.<br>
            <br>
            Here Groucho entered into the contract with Harpo to give Chico a GIFT, so Chico was a DONEE beneficiary. Where there is no evidence Groucho has breached the contract with Harpo, and even if he did Chico would have no right to enforce the contract against Groucho at law.<br>
            <br>
            Therefore, if Groucho had refused to perform the contract (e.g. had refused to make the car payments) Chico could only plead equity against Groucho based on principals of promissory estoppel.
            <br>
            <br>
                                    </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2. ASSIGNMENT of contract benefits?</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law promisees can ASSIGN the benefits they are promised under a contrat to third parties called ASSIGNEES. Promisees who assign contract benefits are called ASSIGNORS.</p>
<p>Contract promises that they &quot;will not be assigned&quot; are &quot;mere covenants&quot; and not express material conditions unless the contract language is <strong>unequivocally clear </strong>that the contract parties intended for non-assignment to be an express material condition. Contract assginments in violation of express material conditions are void ab initio. Contract assignments in breach of mere covenants are minor breaches and promisors have a right to an award of damages against the promisees if any can be proven.</p>
<p>Contract assignments are only EFFECTIVE if assignors <strong>clearly express their intent to assign</strong> the contracts, and <strong>notice of the assignments have been given to the promisors</strong>.</p>
<p>If assignments are for gratuitous purposes the assignees are called DONEE ASSIGNEES and the assignments are LEGALLY REVOCABLE by the assignors untill they have been <strong>stated by assignors in writing</strong> OR a <strong>token chose has been delivered</strong>. Revocation of a gratuitous assignment may be estopped (in equity) based on a claim of detrimental reliance Assignment to a donee assignee is a gift, no contract is created between the assignor and the assignee, and the assignment does not imply any warranties by the assignor.</p>
<p>If assignments are made to satisfy legal obligations the assignees are called CREDITOR ASSIGNEES, the assignments create legal contracts between the assignees and the assignors (promisees), and they are IRREVOCABLE. An assignment to a creditor assignee implies warranties by the assignor 1) that the rights assigne exists, 2) that the promisee/assignor has the authority to assign them to the assignee, and 3) all documents provided to the assignee by the assignor are bone fide. The assignee may seek legal damages from the assignor for a breach of those warranties.</p>
<p>Promisors who breach contracts after they have been effectively assigned (and the assignment has not been effectively revoked) are <strong>only legally liable to the assignees</strong> and are<strong> NOT legally liable to the assignors (original promisees)</strong>. And the promisors can assert any legal or equitable defence against assignees that could have been asserted against the promisees but for the assignment.</p>
<p>Promisees (assignors) are not released from contract obligations by an assignent and if they breach the contracts after they assign them they are <strong>legally</strong> liable to promisors and <strong>creditor assignees</strong> but <strong>NOT to donee assignees</strong>. And the promisees can assert any legal or equitable defense against promisors and assignees that could have been asserted against promisors alone but for the assignment.</p>
<p><strong>Donee</strong> assignees can only seek a remey against breaching <strong>promisees</strong> in EQUITY based on a claim of DETRIMENTAL RELIANCE.</p>
<p>Here ... because .... Therefore ...</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the facts for an essay question say a party &quot;assigns the contract&quot; to a third party, rather than &quot;assigns the contract benefits&quot; that implies there was both an assignment (of contract benefits) and a delegation (of contract duties).</p>
<p><strong>3. MODIFICATION OF CONTRACT AFTER ASSIGNMENT?</strong></p>
<p>If a promisor and promisee agree to modify a contract after the promisee has assigned the contract rights to an assignee, the modification agreement is binding on the assignee IF the contract has <strong>not yet been fully performd</strong> AND the modification is made in good faith in accordance with reasonable commercial standards. The assignee acquires corresponding rights under the modified contract. </p>
<p><strong>Note, for example:</strong> Suppose promisee was to complete performance and be paid on 6/1, and promisee assigned the rights to be paid to assignee. Assignee had a right to be paid on 6/1. But if promisee and promisor agree to delay completion to 7/1 (perhaps because of material shortages) that is binding on assignee. Now assignee has a right to be paid on 7/1 and not on 6/1. </p>
<p><strong>4. DELEGATION of contract duties?</strong></p>
<p>Under Contract law promisors may DELEGATE the duties they have promised to perform under a contract to third parties called DELEGATEES. Promisors who assign conctract duties are called DELEGATORS.</p>
<p>Contracts that necessarily require the personal services of the promisors, and that cannot feasibly be performed by anyone else, are subject to implied material conditions that the promisors cannot delegate contract duties. Otherwise, express contract promises that they &quot;will not be assigned&quot; are &quot;mere covenants&quot; and not express material conditions unless the contract language is <strong>unequivocally clear</strong> that the contract parties intended for personal performance of contract duties by the promisor to be an express material condition.</p>
<p>Delegations of contract duties in violation of express or implied material conditions are void ab initio. Delegations of contract duties in breach of mere covenants are minor breaches and promisors have a right to an award of damages if any can be proven.</p>
<p>Contract delegations are only EFFECTIVE when the delegatee agrees to perform the duties of the promisor/delegator. No notice to the promisee is required.</p>
<p>Delegatees that GRATUITOUSLY agree to perform the duties of delegators/promisors are just volunteers, and they may be called VOLUNTEER DELEGATEES. Volunteer delegatees have no <strong>legal</strong> duty to perform.</p>
<p>Delegetees that agree to perform the duties of delegators/promisors in exchange FOR CONSIDERATION are legally bound in a DELEGATION CONTRACT with the delegator promisor and may be called CONTRACTED DELEGATEES. Contracted delegatees have a legal duty to perform.</p>
<p>Delegation contracts between delegators and contracted delegatees are third party beneficiary contracts because the promisee (in the original contract) is the intended beneficiary of the contract between the delegator and the contracted delegatee.</p>
<p>If delegatees fail to perform the delegator/promisor is always liable to the promisee, regardless whether the delegatee is a volunteer or a contracted delegatee.</p>
<p>If volunteer delegatees fail to perform they have no <strong>legal</strong> duty to anyone. Delegators (promisors) and promisees can only seek a remedy against volunteer delegatees in EQUITY based on claim of detrimental reliance.</p>
<p>If contracted delegatees fail to perform they are <strong>legally liable to both the delegators and the promisees</strong> of the original contract. The action of a promisee against a contracted delegatee is brought as a third party beneficiary under contract between the delegator and the contracted delegatee contract. Contracted delegatees can assert any defense against promisees that they could assert against delegators, and any defenses the delegators could assert against the promisees.</p>
<p>Here .. because ... Therefore..</p>
<p>Note: Like third party beneficiary questions, assignment and delegation questions require that you identify the parties, and explain all of the rights and liabilites each party has against the other parties. That usually takes so much time that there is little time left for anything else.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sample 3 (pg 81) Groucho's rights under the DELEGATION contract?</strong><br>
    Under contract law, a DELEGATION is a second contract conveying the duty of performance under the first contract from the original promisor to a delegatee. The promisor in the first contract retains primary liability to the promisee.
  The delegatee assumes secondary liability to the promisee of the first contract if she expressly accepts the delegation in exchange for consideration, a bargained for exchange of value creating legal liability. In the delegation contract between the promisor / delegator and the delegatee the original promisee is a CREDITOR third-party beneficiary with standing to enforce the contract.<br>
  <br>
  A delegatee can raise all defenses that are available to the promisee in the original contract.<br>
  <br>
  Here there is a delegation contract between Harpo and Swifty supported by consideration because Swifty expressly accepted the duty by saying he &quot;agreed to deliver&quot; in exchange for an &quot;immediate payment of $20,000&quot;.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, Groucho has standing to enforce Swifty's promise to deliver the car as a creditor third party beneficiary.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Groucho's REMEDIES against Swifty?</strong><br>
  A promisee under a contract can enforce the delegation contract as an intended third-party beneficiary in the same way as the original promisee of the delegation agreement (Harpo).<br>
  <br>
  Here Gruocho's remedies against Swifty are the same as his remedies against Harpo, and Groucho can recover from Swifty any amounts he cannot recover from Harpo.
<br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Sample 3 (pg 81) Harpo's rights under the DELEGATION contract?</strong><br>
    Delegation is defined above.<br>
    <br>
    Here the delegation from Harpo to Swifty is a contract between them because Swifty promised &quot;to deliver the car&quot;, and it is a legal contract supported by consideration because Swifty received an &quot;immediate payment of &quot;$20,000&quot;. Swifty was the promisor and Harp the promisee.<br>
    <br>
    Therefore, Harpo can enforce his contract with Swifty and seek recovery from Swifty for any damages due Groucho and / or Chico.  </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>A7. REMEDIES</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. COMMON LAW REMEDY of the NON-BREACHING PARTY?</strong></p>
<p>Under common law the non-breaching party has a right to <strong>COMPENSATORY DAMAGES</strong>, award of a money judgement calculated as the <strong>sum</strong> of:</p>
<ol>
  <li>RELIANCE DAMAGES, expenses incurred in reliance upon the promise of the breaching party,</li>
  <li>EXPECTATION DAMAGES, the loss of expected benefits caused by the breach,</li>
  <li>INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, expenses incurred after the breach as a result (e.g. storage charges),</li>
  <li>CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, lost profits on collateral contracts with third parties that could not be performed because of the breach.</li>
</ol>
<p>Under Hadley v Baxendale, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES can only be awarded if, at the time the original contract was executed, the breaching party knew of or otherwise could have contemplated the non-breaching party would enter into collateral contracts and would lose profits on them as a result of a contract breach.</p>
<p>The burden is on a non-breaching party to prove the damages suffered with CERTAINITY, to prove they were CAUSED BY THE BREACH, and that they COULD NOT BE AVOIDED after the breach occured. By implication this gives the non-breaching party a duty to <strong>mitigate damages</strong>.</p>
<p>As an alternative to requesting a money judgement based on damages the non breaching party has a legal right to demand LEGAL RESTITUTION, a money judgement calculated as the <strong>value of the benefits the breaching party received as a result of the non-breaching party's contract performance</strong>, up to the amount promised under the contract terms.</p>
<p>A non-breaching buyer of unique property may ask the Court (in equity) to award SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE on a claim that award of a money judgement would be an inadequate remedy. Specific performance of services by a natural person cannot be awarded by the Court because it violates the 13th Amendment. And there is no &quot;right&quot; to specific performance.</p>
<p>Here... because ... therefore...</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sample 6 (pg 92): </strong>Under contract law, remedies are COMPENSATORY to give the non-breaching party the benefit of the bargain, the compensation that had been bargained for. If property is UNIQUE money damages are in inadequate remedy and SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE is appropriate.<br>
    <br>
    Here the stock is not &quot;unique&quot; and money damages are adequate.<br>
    <br>
    Therefore Dottie's remedy is an award of money damages equal to the value of the stock.
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Sample 6 (pg 93) EQUITABLE RESITUTION?<br>
  </strong>At equity a party that cannot enforce a promise at law or equity may still seek damages in RESITUTION to prevent UNJUST ENRICHMENT. The measure of damages may be either the benefits their performance conveyed to the breaching party, or else the detriment they have suffered in reasonable reliance.<br>
  <br>
  Here Dottie can seek RESTITUTION for the benefits she conveyed to Fester. He enjoyed benefits that would have cost him $40,000 a year for ten years, so he enjoyed an unjust enrichment of $400,000.<br>
  <br>
  In the alternative Dottie suffered a loss of $50,000 on her house and foregone wages of $2,500,000 over the ten year period, for a total of $2,550,000.<br>
  <br>
  Dottie may seek an award of money damages in these amounts in equitable restitution.<br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Sample 7 (pg 97)
    </strong>Under the UCC a buyer who receives nonconforming goods can REJECT the goods and REPUDIATE the contract. They buyer can COVER by buying the goods elsewhere and demand the excess of the cover price over the contract price, or demand the excess of market price over the contract price.<br>
  <br>
    Here Buyco had a right to reject the goods, and it covered at a price of $5. Since this is less than the $6 contract price, Buyco has suffered <strong>no loss</strong> as a result of the breach and has no right to receive damages from Sellco.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, Buyco's demand for $50,000 has no basis and they would get nothing.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2.      COMMON LAW REMEDY of the BREACHING PARTY?</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law a breaching party that has not committed a major breach will be deemed to have SUBSTANTIALLY PERFORMED and has a right to receive all benefits and payments promised under the contract provisions less an OFFSET for the damages (or legal restitution) awarded to the non-breaching party.</p>
<p>A party that has committed a major breach has no <strong>legal</strong> right to any remedy and must plead in equity. A Court of equity may award the breaching party EQUITABLE RESTITUTION for amounts paid and benefits conferred to the extent they exceed damages awarded to the non-breaching party to PREVENT UNJUST ENRICHMENT or FRUSTRATION OF REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS based on a claim of implied-in-law contract.</p>
<p>Here... because ... therefore...</p>
<p><strong>3. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES?</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law a LIQUIDATED DAMAGES CLAUSE will be binding if it was a <strong>reasonable provision at the time the contract was executed</strong>, because it was foreseeable at the time the contract was executed a breach would cause damages that were not foreseeable in amount, AND it produces a <strong>reasonable remedy after the contract is breached</strong>. In this event the sole remedy for the non-breaching party is award of a money judgement in the amount specified in the contract.</p>
<p>Since a money judgement often is not an adequate remedy for a non-breaching buyer of unique property, liquidatd daages clauses generally will not produce a reasonable remedy and will not be binding in that situation.</p>
<p>Here... because ... therefore...</p>
<p><strong>4. IMPLIED-IN-LAW CONTRACT?</strong></p>
<p>IMPLIED-IN-LAW CONTRACT is an equitable theory or &quot;cause of action&quot; that may be pled by a movant when a contract fails or otherwise there is no valid enforceable contract which will provide a remedy. The Court has <strong>discretion</strong> to provide EQUITABLE RESTITUTION when there is <strong>no valid, legally enforceable contract</strong> if the movant<strong> acted to convey benefits</strong> to the responding party with a <strong>reasonable expectaion of being compensated</strong> in return.</p>
<p>The Court may either award the amount necessary to prevent an unjust enrichment to the respondent, or the amount necessary to prevent frustration of the reasonable expectations of the movant.</p>
<p>Here... because ... therefore...</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This argument should only be raised when no contract is otherwise enforceable at law. Perhaps there was a contract that violated the Statute of Frauds, there was a major breach, or the respondent lacked legal capacity. This equitable theory requires that the movant reasonably expected to be paid for services rendered.</p>
<p><strong>5. PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL?</strong></p>
<p>PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL is an equitable theory or &quot;cause of action&quot; that may be pled by a movant when there is <strong>no valid, legally enforceable contract or other legal cause of action</strong> but the movant has acted in<strong> reasonable reliance </strong>on a promise by the respondent,<strong> the respoondent intended to induce the movant to rely</strong> on the promise, and j<strong>ustice demands</strong> that the promise be enforced to some degree.</p>
<p>The Court may either estop the respondent from reneging on the promise or award the movant a money judgement in EQUITABLE RESTITUTION to prevent the respondent from reaping an unjust enrichment or to compensate the movant for injures suffered or to prevent frustration of reasonable expectations.</p>
<p>Here... because ... therefore...</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This argument should only be raised when the movant seeks to enforce an express promise by the respondent and there is no basis for a tort action for fraud or deceit. Often the promise is a <strong>gift promise</strong> or an assurance the respondent will not assert some legal defense or institute some legal action.</p>
<p>Example: </p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sample 4 (pg 86) PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL?</strong><br>
    Under the doctrine of PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL, a party can seek enforcement of an otherwise unenforceable promise where 1) a party <strong>made a promise</strong>; 2) 
  <strong>intending to induce reliance</strong>; 3) there was<strong> reasonable reliance</strong> by the other party and 4) <strong>injustice</strong> will result if the promise is not enforced.<br>
  <br>
  Here Al <strong>made a promise</strong> to Decca because he &quot;agreed on April 1 to a new agreement&quot;, and he did that <strong>intending to induce reliance</strong>. <br>
  <br>
  Al would argue that Decca
  did not reasonably rely because it was aware Al was a minor and could repudiate the contract at any time. Decca would argue that Al would reap an UNJUST ENRICHMENT because it incurred &quot;$360,000 in distributed expense.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, it would appear that Decca's restitution to Al should be reduced to this amount and restricted to the actual profit made by Decca  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>6. DETRIMENTAL RELIANCE?</strong></p>
<p>DETRIMENTAL RELIANCE is an equitable theory or &quot;cause of action&quot; that may be pled by a movant there is <strong>no valid, legally enforceable contract or other legal cause of action</strong>, but the movant <strong>acted in reasonable reliance </strong>on EITHER <strong>deliberately false representations of fact by the respondent</strong> OR <strong>deliberately misleading behavior of the respondent</strong> done with <strong>intent to induce reliance by the movant</strong>, and <strong>jutice demands </strong>that the promise be enforced to some degree.</p>
<p>The Court may award the movant a money judgment in EQUITABLE RESTITUTION to prevent the respondent from reaping an unjust enrichment or to compensate the movant for injuries suffered or to prevent frustration of reasonable expectations.</p>
<p>Here... because ... therefore...</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This argument should only be raised when there is no &quot;promise&quot; at all, and no other basis to claim either implied-in-law contract or promissory estoppel. They element here is that respondent must act (or refrain from acting) with deliberate intent to cause the movant to rely on either false statements of fact or else misleading behavior.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sample 6 (pg 93) EQUITABLE RESITUTION?</strong><br>
    <br>
  At equity a party that cannot enforce a promise at law or equity may still seek damages in RESITUTION to prevent UNJUST ENRICHMENT. The measure of damages may be either the benefits their performance conveyed to the breaching party, or else the detriment they have suffered in reasonable reliance.<br>
  <br>
  Here Dottie can seek RESTITUTION for the benefits she conveyed to Fester. He enjoyed benefits that would have cost him $40,000 a year for ten years, so he enjoyed an unjust enrichment of $400,000.<br>
  <br>
  In the alternative Dottie suffered a loss of $50,000 on her house and foregone wages of $2,500,000 over the ten year period, for a total of $2,550,000.<br>
  <br>
  Dottie may seek an award of money damages in these amounts in equitable restitution.</li>

<p><strong>COMMON LAW CONTRACT RULES AND DEFINITIONS:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>ACCEPTANCE (CONTRACTS): </strong>Under the common law MIRROR IMAGE RULE an acceptance is an <u>unequivocal</u> <u>assent</u> to an offer, <u>communicated</u> to the offeror and it can be implied by silent commencement of performance known to the offeror. A response that is equivocal or contains varying terms is a REJECTION AND COUNTER-OFFER and not an effective acceptance. An offer must be accepted within a reasonable period. (see OFFER, LAPSE.) </li>
  <li> <strong>ACCORD </strong><strong>AND</strong> <strong>SATISFACTION</strong> <strong> (CONTRACTS</strong> <strong>): </strong>An ACCORD AND SATISFACTION is a binding agreement settling a reasonable, good faith dispute over the terms and/or performance of a contract.</li>
  <li><strong>ADHESION CONTRACT (CONTRACTS): </strong><strong> </strong>An adhesion contract is a "take it or leave it" offer that courts will not enforce if there is a lack of reasonable contractual intent on the part of the offeree. (see UNCONSCIONABLE CONTRACT.)</li>
  <li><strong>ANTICIPATORY BREACH (CONTRACTS): <strong> </strong></strong>An anticipatory breach  is a <u>clear statement of intent</u> by a party to a contract, <u>prior to the time</u> performance is due, that they <u>will not perform</u> when performance is due. An anticipatory breach is a<u> MAJOR breach</u> (see BREACH) that <u>excuses</u> the non-breaching party from performance and <u>accelerates</u> the breaching party's duty of performance to the immediate unless the non-breaching party WAIVES the breach by letting the breaching party continue performance. (compare to REASONABLE ASSURANCES.)</li>
  <li><strong>ASSIGNMENT (CONTRACTS): </strong>An assignment is the transfer of <u>contractual rights</u> from the promisee/assignor to the assignee based on a <u>clear statement of intent</u> by the promisee. The assignment becomes effective when the promisor is given <u>notice</u> of the assignment. Once the assignment is effective the promisor has a duty to deliver the benefits of the contract (pay) directly to the assignee and the rights of the original promisee/assignor are extinguished. The promisee/assignor has secondary liability to the assignee if the assignment is in exchange for consideration. (see DELEGATION.)</li>
  <li><strong>BREACH (CONTRACTS): </strong>A contract breach is a failure to perform a contractual duty that is currently due to be performed. Under the common law it can be MAJOR or MINOR. A MAJOR breach is one that <u>substantially deprives</u> the non-breaching party of the EXPECTED BENEFIT OF THE BARGAIN (which see). A major breach <u>excuses</u> the non-breaching party from all contractual duties and <u>waives</u> conditions on other contractual duties of the breaching party <u>accelerating</u> them to become present duties. A breach is MINOR if the breaching party has SUBSTANTIALLY PERFORMED (which see). A minor breach  entitles the non-breaching party to <u>compensation</u> in the form of damages, but it <u>does not excuse</u> the non-breaching party from performance or accelerate performance by the breaching party.</li>
  <li><strong>CONDITION (CONTRACTS): </strong>A contract condition is something that must happen or a condition that must exist before performance of a contractual duty becomes due.

        <p><strong>Constructive. </strong>If one of the parties is to perform a duty in exchange for payment, the performance of the duty is an implied CONDITION that must be fully performed before the duty to pay becomes due, and such conditions are called CONSTRUCTIVE CONDITIONS. </p>
        <p><strong>Material Conditions. </strong>A condition is MATERIAL if it is so important that its failure will deny the parties the benefit of the bargain. Failure of a material condition excuses the parties from further performance. If a condition is NOT MATERIAL its failure does not deny a party the benefit of the bargain and does not excuse the parties from performance.</p>
        <p><strong>Timely Performance.</strong> If the parties agree "time is of the essence" timely performance is an EXPRESS MATERIAL CONDITION, and failure to perform in a timely manner is a MAJOR BREACH. Otherwise time may be deemed to be an IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION by the nature and circumstances of the contract and the consequences of tardy performance, without any such agreement of the parties. If the parties do not expressly agree timely performance is "of the essence" and the circumstances do not indicate it is an implied material condition, it is not material and failure to perform in a timely manner is a MINOR BREACH.</p>

  </li>
  <li><strong>CONDITION CONCURRENT (CONTRACTS):</strong> A CONDITION CONCURRENT is a condition that must be satisfied <u>at the same time</u> a contractual duty to perform ripens. This is rare and effectively means both parties to a contract must perform contractual duties at the same time and neither has any duty to perform unless the other party simultaneously tenders performance. Real estate sales contracts create conditions concurrent. (see CONDITION PRECEDENT, CONDITION SUBSEQUENT).</li>
  <li><strong>CONDITION PRECEDENT (CONTRACTS):</strong> A CONDITION PRECEDENT is a condition that must be satisfied <u>before</u> a contractual duty to perform ripens. This is very common and means that there is no contractual to perform until the condition is satisfied. (see CONDITION CONCURRENT, CONDITION SUBSEQUENT).</li>
  <li><strong>CONDITION SUBSEQUENT (CONTRACTS):</strong> A CONDITION SUBSEQUENT is a condition that must be satisfied <u>while</u> a contractual duty to perform exists, and if the condition fails the ripened duty to perform is excused . (see CONDITION CONCURRENT, CONDITION PRECEDENT).</li>
  <li><strong>CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES</strong> <strong> (CONTRACTS): </strong>Under <em>Hadley v. Baxendale</em> damages for <u>lost profits</u> caused by a breach of contract will only be awarded, absent express contract provisions otherwise, where the damages were 1) <u>CONTEMPLATED</u> by (known to) the breaching party <u>at the time of the contract</u>, 2) can be measured with <u>CERTAINTY</u>, 3) were <u>CLEARLY CAUSED</u> by the breach and 4) <u>COULD NOT BE AVOIDED</u> by the non-breaching party. [mnemonic = <strong>CCCC</strong>]</li>
  <li><strong>CONSIDERATION (CONTRACTS): </strong>Under contract law consideration is a <u>bargained for</u>exchange of value posing sufficient <u>legal detriment</u>  that the law will enforce an agreement. Separate consideration is required to support a <u>modification of an existing contract</u> except under the UCC where no additional consideration is required to support contract modification.</li>
  <li><strong>CONSTRUCTIVE CONDITIONS (CONTRACTS):</strong> CONSTRUCTIVE CONDITIONS are implied conditions  that must be satisfied before contractual duties ripen. They are implied by the nature of a contract and the express covenants within it. If a contract party promises to perform duties in exchange for payment by the other party, the duty to pay is subject to an implied CONSTRUCTIVE CONDITION PRECEDENT that the duty to pay does not ripen until the other party has completed performance. (see CONDITION PRECEDENT).</li>
  <li><strong>CONTRACT (CONTRACTS): </strong>A contract is a promise or set of promises, the performance of which the law recognizes as a duty and for the breach of which the law will provide a remedy.  Every valid contract is based on <u>OFFER</u>, <u>ACCEPTANCE</u>, and <u>LEGAL CONSIDERATION.</u></li>
  <li><strong>DECEIT (CONTRACTS): </strong>Deceit is a defense to enforcement of a contract which is also called FRAUD (which see.)</li>
  <li><strong>DELEGATION (CONTRACTS): </strong>A delegation is a <u>transfer of contractual duties</u> from the promisor/delegator to a delegatee based on a <u>clear statement of intent</u> by the delegator and <u>acceptance of the duty</u> by the delegatee. The promisor/delegator retains primary liability to the promisee. If the delegatee accepts contractual duties in exchange for consideration, a contract between the promisor and delegatee forms, and the promisee is an intended third-party beneficiary of that contract with standing to enforce it at law against both parties. If the delegatee gratuitously accepts contractual duties the promisee can only enforce the promisor-delegatee agreement at equity based on an argument of detrimental reliance. The delegation of a contract is void  if the contract requires the unique personal services or attributes of the original party, the delegator. (see ASSIGNMENT, THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY.)</li>
  <li><strong>DURESS (CONTRACTS): </strong>Contracts are always unenforceable against parties that enter into the agreements because of threats of physical harm, and they are generally unenforceable against parties who enter into the agreements because of threats of economic harm that were <u>deliberately created</u> by the party seeking to enforce the contract.</li>
  <li><strong>ELECTION (CONTRACTS): </strong>If a party commits an anticipatory breach by clearly indicating they are not going to perform a contractual duty in the future the non-breaching party may "elect" to treat the breach as minor by negotiating a modification of the contract terms. The non-breaching party is said to have "waived" the breach and cannot later claim the anticipatory breach was a major breach. [See WAIVER]</li>
  <li><strong>ESTOPPEL (CONTRACTS): </strong>Estoppel is an EQUITABLE remedy that may &ldquo;estop&rdquo; a party (a respondent) from acting in a way that is contrary to their previous assurances to the moving party (the movant) to prevent an injustice. (see PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL.)</li>
  <li><strong>EXPECTED BENEFIT OF THE BARGAIN (CONTRACTS): </strong>The expected benefit of the bargain  is the advantage or benefit that a party reasonably expects to derive from entering into a contract. (see BREACH).</li>
  <li><strong>EXPRESS MATERIAL CONDITION (CONTRACTS):</strong> EXPRESS MATERIAL CONDITIONS are detailed contract specifications the parties expressly agreed upon, and the failure of which completely excuses a party from performance, subject to equitable considerations. Express promises of TIMELY PERFORMANCE or SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE are often viewed as &ldquo;mere covenants&rdquo; rather than express material conditions. (see MATERIAL CONDITIONS).</li>
  <li><strong>FRAUD (CONTRACTS): </strong>Fraud is a complete defense to enforcement of a contract when 1) a party seeking to enforce the contract MISREPRESENTED material facts with 2) an INTENT to DECEIVE, 3) the party seeking to void  the contract REASONABLY RELIED on the misrepresented facts, and 4) the party seeking to void the contract WOULD NOT HAVE ENTERED THE CONTRACT if they had known the true facts.  (Also called DECEIT; see NONDISCLOSURE as an alternative theory. For CRIMES see FALSE PRETENSES.)</li>
  <li><strong>FRUSTRATION OF PURPOSE</strong> <strong> (CONTRACTS): </strong>If a party enters into a contract <u>knowing the specific benefit</u> the other party seeks to gain from entering into the agreement, the continued feasibility of attaining that benefit is an IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION  of the contract. If subsequent events <u>beyond the control</u> of the parties render that benefit impossible to attain, frustration of purpose causes failure of that implied material condition  and the contract becomes unenforceable. (see IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION).</li>
  <li><strong>ILLEGAL CONTRACT (CONTRACTS): </strong>The court will not generally enforce a contract for a party that <u>knowingly entered</u> into the contract for an <u>illegal purpose</u> because it would impugn the integrity of the court. However, if the party seeking enforcement was <u>not equally guilty</u> (not IN PARI DELICTO, which see) then the court may order <u>restitution.</u></li>
  <li><strong>IMPLIED-IN-</strong> <strong>FACT</strong> <strong>CONTRACT (CONTRACTS): </strong>If a party <u>acts to bestow benefits</u> on another party <u>reasonably expecting to be paid</u> and the other party <u>knowingly accepts those benefits</u> an implied-in-fact contract forms which is <u>enforceable at law.</u></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Example: </strong>Work crew shows up at <u>wrong house</u> to install a swimming pool. The owner says nothing as pool is installed. The court will find an agreement to pay for the pool was implied by his behavior.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<ol start="26">
  <li><strong>IMPLIED-IN-LAW CONTRACT</strong> <strong> (CONTRACTS): </strong>If a party <u>acts to bestow benefits</u> on another party <u>reasonably expecting to be paid</u> a Court of <u>equity</u>  may provide an equitable remedy based on an &ldquo;implied-in-law contract theory&rdquo; to prevent <u>unjust enrichment to the defendant,</u> prevent <u>unjust detriment to the plaintiff</u> or to <u>protect the public interest</u> . The court only enforce payment on this basis to one who acts for the purpose and with the reasonable expectation they will be paid -- not a <u>volunteer</u> or <u>intermeddler</u>. 
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Example: </strong>Pedestrian is hit by a car and unconscious. An ambulance takes him to the hospital. The court will order him or his estate to pay the ambulance as a matter of public policy.</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION</strong> <strong> (CONTRACTS):</strong> All contracts are subject to IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITIONS that are implied by contract law in general or the nature of the particular contract. (see MATERIAL CONDITIONS).</li>
  <li><strong>IMPOSSIBILITY (CONTRACTS): </strong>A court will generally find there has been a failure of an IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION  that excuses the parties from performance if performance is <u>impossible</u> (not just expensive or difficult) because of events that were <u>beyond the control</u> of the party in default. (see IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION).</li>
  <li><strong>INCAPACITY (CONTRACTS): </strong>A contract generally cannot be enforced at law against a party who lacked contractual capacity at the time of execution. If the incapacity later ends the contract will <u>become enforceable</u> if the party to be bound expressly RATIFIES (affirms) the contract or otherwise impliedly ratifies it by FAILING TO REPUDIATE it within a reasonable time period (often set by statute). For example, a minor may repudiate a contract at any time before reaching adulthood. If the contract is not repudiated within a reasonable time after attaining adulthood, the contract is impliedly ratified. A contract otherwise unenforceable at law based on lack of capacity may often be enforced at equity if it is for provision of <u>necessities of life.</u> For example, a contract for food, shelter or clothing may be enforceable against a minor at equity. (see RATIFICATION, REPUDIATION.)</li>
  <li><strong>IN PARI DELICTO (CONTRACTS): </strong>A court will not enforce an illegal contract or provide any restitution if the party seeking restitution is equally guilty (in pari delicto) compared to the party from whom restitution is sought.</li>
  <li><strong>INVITATION TO NEGOTIATE (CONTRACTS): </strong>An invitation to negotiate is any communication that fails to qualify as a contract OFFER because there is no manifestation of present contractual intent or else the terms are so vaguely stated no reasonable person would believe assent would form a bargain.</li>
  <li><strong>LAPSE (CONTRACTS): </strong>An offer lapses if <u>not accepted</u> in the <u>time stated</u>, or if no time is stated within a <u>reasonable period</u> as indicated by the means by which the offer is transmitted. An oral offer lapses at the end of the conversation. A written offer lapses at the end of the time established by the means of dispatch. </li>
  <li><strong>LIQUIDATED DAMAGES</strong> <strong> (CONTRACTS): </strong>A liquidated damages clause is an agreement that in the event of breach the remedy of the non-breaching party will be limited to a specified quantity of money damages. Liquidated damages clauses are unenforceable unless 1) at the time of execution the potential <u>damages from beach were uncertain</u>, 2) the liquidated damages specified were <u>reasonable at the time of execution</u>, and 3) the liquidated damages specified are <u>reasonable at the time of breach</u>. If a contract is for sale of UNIQUE PROPERTY money damages are inadequate and SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE  is appropriate. Therefore a liquidated damages clause is unreasonable and unenforceable in such cases.</li>
  <li><strong>MAILBOX RULES (CONTRACTS):</strong> Under the broadly adopted common law all contract communications are effective upon <u>receipt</u> by the offeror with the exception that <u>ACCEPTANCES</u> are generally effective upon dispatch by the offeree if they are sent by the means specified in the offer or by the <u>same or faster means</u> than the offer if the offer does not specify a means of communication. HOWEVER if an offeree dispatches both an acceptance and a rejection the rejection will be effective, not the acceptance, if the rejection is received first and the offeror <u>changes position</u> in reliance upon it. </li>
  <li><strong>MAJOR BREACH (CONTRACTS):</strong> A major breach of contract is one that substantially deprives the non-breaching party of the EXPECTED BENEFIT OF THE BARGAIN. It excuses the non-breaching party from all contract duties, accelerates the duties of the breaching party, and waiving all remaining conditions on the duties of the breaching party. (see BREACH).</li>
  <li><strong>MATERIAL CONDITION (CONTRACTS):</strong> A MATERIAL CONDITION is one that must be satisfied for the parties to a contract have any duty to perform. A material condition  may be expressly stated by the parties or implied by contract law in general or by the nature of the specific agreement. The failure of a material condition generally denies one or both parties the EXPECTED BENEFIT OF THE BARGAIN, excusing them from the contract. (see EXPECTED BENEFIT OF THE BARGAIN).</li>
  <li><strong>MUTUAL MISTAKE (CONTRACTS): </strong> Under the common law doctrine of <em>Peerless</em>, if both parties enter into a contract because <u>each suffers a misunderstanding of material fact</u> the contract is <u>void</u>  because there was no &ldquo;meeting of the minds &rdquo; and no valid contractual intent. (see UNILATERAL MISTAKE .)</li>
  <li><strong>NONDISCLOSURE (CONTRACTS): </strong>A defense to enforcement of a contract based on</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li><u>Duty of a party to reveal</u> material facts,<u></u></li>
    <li><u>Concealment of material facts</u> by the party with the duty,<u></u></li>
    <li><u>Reasonable reliance</u> on appearances by the party seeking to invalidate the contract.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The difference between NONDISCLOSURE and FRAUD is that the later requires an <u>intentional act of misrepresentation</u> while the former relies on a <u>negligent failure to disclose</u>. (see FRAUD as alternative theory.)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="39">
  <li><strong>OFFER</strong><strong> (CONTRACTS): </strong>A contract offer is a <u>manifestation </u>of present contractual <u>intent</u><u>communicated</u> to the offeree so certain in terms that an objective person would reasonably <u>believe assent</u> would form a bargain. Under common law an offer must generally specify the <u>parties</u>, <u>subject</u> matter, <u>quantity</u>, <u>price</u>, and <u>time</u> of performance. An offer LAPSES if not accepted within a reasonable period of time. (see LAPSE, ACCEPTANCE.)</li>
  <li><strong>OPTION (CONTRACTS): </strong>An option at common law is a contractual agreement under which an offeree exchanges consideration for a contract <u>offer</u> and <u>a promise</u> from the offeror that the offer will not be revoked for an <u>agreed period of time</u>. </li>
  <li><strong>ORAL</strong> <strong>CONDITION PRECEDENT (CONTRACTS):</strong> An ORAL CONDITION PRECEDENT is an oral agreement that a condition precedent  must be satisfied or else a contractual duty to perform under the terms of a separate contract agreement will not be binding. It is an exception to the PAROL EVIDENCE RULE. (see PAROL EVIDENCE RULE, CONDITION PRECEDENT.)</li>
  <li><strong>PAROL EVIDENCE RULE (CONTRACTS):</strong> Evidence concerning PRIOR or CONTEMPORANEOUS agreements can not be introduced to VARY or CONTRADICT the terms of a FULLY INTEGRATED WRITING unless they are offered to show evidence of <strong>[DAM FOIL]</strong> Duress, Ambiguity , Mistake, Fraud, Oral condition precedent,  Illegality , or Lack of consideration.</li>
  <li><strong>PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL (CONTRACTS): </strong>Promissory estoppel is an equitable doctrine that may bar a party from revoking a promise if 1) the party made a <u>promise</u>, 2) intending <u>to induce or reasonably knowing that it would induce reliance</u>, 3) there was <u>reasonable reliance</u>by the other party seeking enforcement of the promise, and 4) <u>injustice would result</u> otherwise. (see ESTOPPEL).</li>
  <li><strong>QUANTUM MERUIT (CONTRACTS): </strong>Quantum meruit  is used by different people to mean different things. Generally it is used to mean RESTITUTION or the award of damages in restitution to prevent UNJUST ENRICHMENT (which see). But this term is also used at times to mean an implied-in-law contract or even implied contract s in general.</li>
  <li><strong>RATIFICATION (CONTRACTS):</strong> Ratification is the act of contract parties who lack contractual capacity at the time of execution (e.g. minors) affirming otherwise voidable contract s after attaining contractual capacity. (see INCAPACITY, REPUDIATION.)</li>
  <li><strong>REASONABLE ASSURANCES (CONTRACTS):</strong> A contract party that has <u>reasonable doubts</u> about the other party's ability or willingness to perform future duties under a contract may demand <u>REASONABLE ASSURANCES</u> from the other party in the form of a financial guarantee or payment to escrow. If the requested party fails to provide reasonable assurances that may be treated as an anticipatory repudiation  of the contract.</li>
  <li><strong>RESCISSION (CONTRACTS):</strong> Rescission is the act of declaring a contract void. If a party legally declares the contract void it is a LEGAL RESCISSION. If a Court declares the contract void it is an EQUITABLE RESCISSION.</li>
  <li><strong>REMEDY OF NON-BREACHING </strong><strong>PARTY</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(CONTRACTS):</strong> Under common law a non-breaching contract party has a right to an award of a money judgment measured by the DAMAGES caused by the breach of a valid, enforceable contract or in the alternative for RESTITUTION in the amount the breaching party would otherwise benefit from the breach. If the contract was for unique property or services the non-breaching party may plead in equity for SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE  (which see). But the 13th Amendment bars courts from ordering performance of <u>personal services</u>. And there is no &ldquo;right&rdquo; to specific performance.</li>
  <li><strong>REMEDY OF BREACHING </strong><strong>PARTY </strong><strong>(CONTRACTS):</strong>  At common law a seller that substantially performs has a right to be paid the contract price less an offset  for the damages caused by the breach. A seller that has committed a major breach can only plead for EQUITABLE RESTITUTION which will generally be limited to the amount their performance benefited the non-breaching party. </li>
  <li><strong>REPUDIATION (CONTRACTS):</strong> Repudiation is the act of a party declaring an intention to not perform contractual duties. A repudiation is a LEGAL RESCISSION if it is based on a legal basis (e.g. pursuant to a contract option, because of failure of an implied material conditions, etc.). If there is no legal basis for the repudiation it is a major breach of the contract.</li>
  <li><strong>RESTITUTION (CONTRACTS): </strong>Restitution is a Court award of a remedy (e.g. a money judgment) to a contract party to prevent UNJUST ENRICHMENT, to restore the STATUS QUO or to protect the public interest by preventing FRUSTRATION OF REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS. A non-breaching party has a right to demand an award of LEGAL RESTITUTION instead of an award based on damages resulting from a breach of contract. A breaching party may request an award of EQUITABLE RESTITUTION. When a contract is void or becomes void because of a failure of condition EQUITABLE RESTITUTION is the only remedy for either party.</li>
  <li><strong>REVOCATION (CONTRACTS): </strong>A revocation is a <u>withdrawal</u> or <u>cancellation</u> of an offer by the offeror, and it is effective if received by the offeree before the offer has been effectively accepted. An offeror cannot revoke an <u>option contract</u> for the time agreed as long as the option contract is properly supported by consideration.  Under modern SAVING DOCTRINES a UNILATERAL CONTRACT OFFER may not be revocable if the offeror is aware the offeree has commenced performance of the requested act (see SAVING DOCTRINES).</li>
  <li> <strong>SAVING DOCTRINES (CONTRACTS):</strong> Under the modern view a UNILATERAL CONTRACT OFFER generally cannot be revoked if the offeror is aware the offeree has commenced performance of the requested act necessary for acceptance until the offeree has been given a reasonable time to complete performance. Some States allow revocation but require restitution to prevent unjust enrichment.</li>
  <li><strong>SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE</strong> <strong> (CONTRACTS):</strong> If money damages are an inadequate <u>legal</u>remedy because unique property (land, art objects, etc.) are in dispute a Court of <u>equity</u>  may order enforcement of a contract promise, but parties never have a &ldquo;right&rdquo; to specific performance.</li>
  <li><strong>STANDING (CONTRACTS):</strong> Standing means that a plaintiff has a right to pursue a legal remedy because they have suffered actual damages. <strong>STATUS QUO (CONTRACTS):</strong> The status quo means the positions of the parties prior to entering into a contract agreement.</li>
  <li><strong>STATUTE OF FRAUDS (CONTRACTS): </strong>Under the Statute of Frauds certain contracts, otherwise valid, cannot be enforced unless supported by a writing. The contracts affected are those for <u>MARRIAGE</u>, those that would necessarily take more than a <u>YEAR</u> to complete, those for the conveyance of an interest in <u>LAND</u> , those by an <u>EXECUTOR</u> of an estate, those for the <u>GUARANTEE</u> of a debt. <strong>[MYLEG]</strong> </li>
  <li><strong>SUBSTANTIAL PERFORMANCE (CONTRACTS):</strong> Substantial performance means that a breaching contract party substantially provided the non-breaching party with the EXPECTED BENEFIT OF THE BARGAIN (which see.)</li>
  <li><strong>THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY (CONTRACTS):</strong> A "third-party beneficiary contract" is a contract between two parties intended to benefit a third party. The intended beneficiary has STANDING to enforce the contract and seek damages for breach if they are vested. Modernly it does not matter if the original contract parties acted to <u>extinguish a debt</u> to the third party (CREDITOR beneficiaries) or acted out of <u>gratuitous motives</u> (DONEE beneficiaries). The third-party beneficiary may enforce the contract after they <u>vest</u> by becoming <u>aware of</u> and <u>relying on</u> the existence of the contract. A party that benefits from a contract that was <u>not established for their benefit</u> is an INCIDENTAL beneficiary with no standing to enforce, even if they have relied on the contract's existence.</li>
  <li><strong>UNCONSCIONABLE CONTRACT (CONTRACTS): </strong>A Court has discretion to decline to enforce a contract that is so one-sided that it implies a lack of reasonable intent to be bound on the part of the offeree or otherwise would be unjust (inequitable). (see ADHESION contract.)</li>
  <li><strong>UNILATERAL CONTRACT (CONTRACTS): </strong>A unilateral contract offer is one that by its own terms <u>unequivocally</u> restricts the means of acceptance to the <u>act of complete performance</u>only. (See SAVING DOCTRINES).</li>
  <li><strong>UNILATERAL MISTAKE</strong> <strong> (CONTRACTS): </strong>Under contract law if a party enters into a contract <u>suffering from a misunderstanding of fact</u> that the other party <u>knew or should have known</u> about, the contract is voidable  by the mistaken party. But if the other party did not know or have reason to know of the mistake the contract is legally binding and not voidable in most States. In a minority of States the mistaken party may rescind the contract if 1) the error is discovered before the other party has irrevocably acted in reliance, 2) prompt notice of the error is given, and 3) the other party is reimbursed for all expenses caused by the error and rescission.  (see MUTUAL MISTAKE.)</li>
  <li><strong>UNJUST ENRICHMENT (CONTRACTS): </strong>A Court may award a remedy (usually a money judgment) in RESTITUTION to prevent an unjust enrichment rather than a remedy based on damages. (see RESTITUTION). A non-breaching party has a right to demand LEGAL RESTITUTION as an alternative to damages. A breaching party can only plead for an award of EQUITABLE RESTITUTION.</li>
  <li><strong>WAIVER OF BREACH (CONTRACTS): </strong>A &ldquo;waiver of a breach&rdquo; is an ELECTION by a non-breaching party to treat a major breach as a minor breach , allowing the breaching party to <u>continue performing</u> under the contract. Following the waiver of a breach the non-breaching party cannot retract the waiver to claim a major breach.</li>
  <li><strong>WAIVER OF CONDITION (CONTRACTS): </strong>A waiver of condition means that a contract party performs a contractual duty that was not due to be performed because it was subject to a CONDITION PRECEDENT that was not satisfied. Following a waiver of a condition the performing party may retract the waiver and refuse to perform the duty in the future unless the condition is satisfied.</li>

<p><strong>UCC</strong></p>
<p>All explanation is given above along with common law.</p>
<p>1. Does UCC apply?</p>
<p>2. Are the parties MERCHANTS?</p>
<p>3. Need for WRITING?</p>
<p>4. OFFER?</p>
<p><strong>5. ACCEPTANCE?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Def:</strong> Under UCC 2 - 206, an acceptance of an offer <strong>not otherwise conditioned</strong> may be made in any <strong>reasonable manner</strong>, including a <strong>promise</strong> to ship or <strong>shipment</strong> of either conforming or non-confirming goods. But a shipment of non-conforming goods as an <strong>express accomodation</strong> is not an acceptance.</p>
<p>Here ... because... Therefore...</p>
<p><strong>6. ACCEPTANCE WITH VARYING TERMS?</strong></p>
<p>Under UCC 2 - 207 allows an acceptance containing varying terms to be effective. Varying terms will NOT be included in the contract where:</p>
<ol>
  <li>the offer expressly limited acceptance and the offeror does not agree to the new terms, OR</li>
  <li>the parties are not both merchants, OR if they are both merchants - </li>
  <li>the varying terms materially alter the contract OR if not a material alteration -</li>
  <li>the party to be bound expressly and timely objects in writing to the change in contract terms.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here... because.. therefore</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Whether an offeree has 1) rejected an offer and countered with a new offer or 2) accepted with varying terms per UCC 2-207 depends on the precise language they use. Be careful to distinguish the use of the words &quot;will&quot; and &quot;would&quot; from the words &quot;can&quot; and &quot;could&quot;.</p>
<p>For example, if the offeree says they, &quot;can (or could) ship, but without a warranty,&quot; it is a rejection and counteroffer. But if they say they &quot;will (or would) ship, but without a warranty,&quot; it is an acceptance with varying term is goverened by UCC 2-207.</p>
<p>In a formation-type quesiton if there is a contract formed, it MUST be discovered in the analysis of an acceptance - that is the only place the contract can be formed. So as soon as a contract forms, it is often useful to analyse its terms as the next issue.</p>
<p><strong>7. CONTRACT TERMS? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>In formation questions this is often a good issue to address immediately after a contract forms, especially if the parties are arguing over terms.</p>
<p><strong>Def:</strong> Under the UCC, a contract is enforceable if the <strong>quantity</strong> and <strong>parties</strong> are specified. Other terms will be provided by the GAP FILLER provisions of the UCC which use the <strong>past course of conduct </strong>of the parties and <strong>industry standards</strong> to determine missing terms. Further, no statemene tof quantity is needed for a REQUIREMENTS contract under which the seller will sell , and the buyer will buy, <strong>all of the goods needed by the buyer</strong>. And no statement of quantity is needed for an OUTPUT contract under which the seller will sell, and the buyer will buy, <strong>all of the goods the seller can produce</strong>.</p>
<p>Here ... because ... Therefore...</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>UCC RULES AND DEFINITIONS </strong></p>
<ul>
  <ol>
    <strong></strong>
    <li><strong>ACCEPTANCE (UCC): </strong>Under UCC 2-206 an acceptance to an offer not other wise conditioned may be made in any REASONABLE MANNER, including a <u>promise</u> to ship or <u>shipment</u> of either conforming or non-conforming goods, but a shipment of NON-CONFORMING goods as an EXPRESS ACCOMMODATION is not an acceptance. UCC 2-207 allows an acceptance containing varying terms to be effective.</li>
    <li><strong>ACCORD<strong> </strong><strong>AND</strong> <strong>SATISFACTION</strong> <strong> (UCC 3-311</strong> <strong>):</strong></strong><strong> </strong>An ACCORD ANDSATISFACTION is a binding agreement settling a reasonable, good faith dispute over the terms and/or performance of a contract. Further, under UCC 3-311 the good faith tender and acceptance of an instrument as &ldquo;full satisfaction&rdquo; of any claim that is unliquidated or the subject of a bona fide dispute is generally binding, subject to certain statutory limitations and exceptions. <strong></strong></li>
    <li><strong>CONSIDERATION (UCC): </strong>Under the UCC consideration is required to establish a contract, but additional consideration is not required to support the <u>modification</u> of the previously existing agreement.<strong></strong></li>
    <li><strong>CURE (UCC): </strong>Under the UCC a breaching seller has a right to cure a delivery of non-conforming goods if the seller 1) promptly notifies the buyer of the intent to cure and either 2) cures the breach by delivery of conforming goods within the contract period or 3) cures a delivery of non-conforming goods that were shipped with a reasonable belief they were suitable for the buyer's needs, within a reasonable time beyond the contract period.<strong></strong></li>
    <li><strong>DIVISIBLE CONTRACT (UCC): </strong>Under the UCC a divisible contract is one that schedules more than one shipment of goods in a manner that payment can be made for individual shipments. A shipment of non-conforming goods is a partial breach, but the buyer cannot repudiate the contract with respect to subsequent scheduled shipments.<strong></strong></li>
    <li><strong>GOODS (UCC): </strong>Under the UCC anything <u>movable</u> and <u>identifiable</u> to a contract at the time of formation. A sale of standing crops and timber attached to the land are also goods even though they are not "moveable" at the time of sale. A sale of minerals to be extracted from the land are only goods if they are to be extracted by the seller. Personal property rights like copyrights are not goods, and neither are contracts for services, stocks, bonds, or currency. <strong></strong></li>
    <li><strong>MERCHANT (UCC):</strong> A person who <u>trades</u> in or otherwise <u>holds himself out as knowledgeable</u> about the goods of the contract. Can be a hobbyist or regular purchaser of goods.</li>
    <li><strong>MERCHANT'S FIRM OFFER (UCC): </strong>Under UCC 2-205 a merchant's offer to sell goods that expressly states <u>in writing</u> that the offer is irrevocable for any period of time is irrevocable for the time stated, not to exceed 3 months, or if no time is stated for a reasonable period of time given the circumstances, not exceeding 3 months, without the need for consideration. If a merchant's firm offer is on a printed form supplied by the offeree the statement that the offer is irrevocable must be separately signed by the offeror. A merchant's firm offer does not automatically lapse before the time stated or for a reasonable period of time if no time is stated.<strong></strong></li>
    <li><strong>OFFER (UCC): </strong>Under the UCC an offer need only specify the <u>parties</u> and <u>quantity</u> as UCC "gap fillers" may be used to determine additional terms based on the <u>past course of dealing</u> between the parties and <u>industry norms.</u>. Further, the UCC does not require quantity to be stated for REQUIREMENTS and OUTPUT contracts (which see.)<strong></strong></li>
    <li><strong>OUTPUT CONTRACTS (UCC): </strong>An output contract is an agreement that a buyer will buy <u>all amounts produced</u> by the seller. The quantity is defined by the reasonable expectations of the parties. [Note: This must be an agreement that the seller will sell ALL of his output to the buyer and not just that he can sell all the output he "wants" to sell to the buyer or else the seller is not bound to anything and the contract becomes illusory.]<strong></strong></li>
    <li><strong>PERFECT TENDER RULE (UCC): </strong>Under the UCC a seller of goods must meet the offer terms <u>exactly</u>. If goods deviate from the offer terms in any manner they are <u>non-conforming goods</u> and the buyer can reject them and demand conforming goods.<strong></strong></li>
    <li><strong>REASONABLE ASSURANCES (UCC):</strong> Under the UCC a contract party that has <u>reasonable doubts</u> about the other party's ability or willingness to perform under a contract may demand <u>reasonable assurances</u> of payment in the form of a financial guarantee or payment to escrow.<strong></strong></li>
    <li><strong>REMEDY OF BREACHING BUYER (UCC):</strong> Under the UCC the breaching buyer can demand <u>return of deposits</u> or payments in excess of the non-breaching seller's damages.<strong></strong></li>
    <li><strong>REMEDY OF BREACHING SELLER (UCC):</strong> Under the UCC the breaching seller, upon giving notice to the buyer, has a right to cure within the contract period and has a right to extra <u>reasonable time to cure</u> beyond the contract period if a non-conforming shipment was sent with a <u>reasonable belief it was suitable</u>for the buyer's needs.<strong></strong></li>
    <li><strong>REMEDY OF NON-BREACHING BUYER (UCC):</strong> A non-breaching buyer may request SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE to obtain possession and title to<u>unique goods</u> such as antiques. Otherwise, the non-breaching party may <u>accept</u>or <u>reject</u> non-conforming goods, <u>repudiate</u> the contract, <u>cover</u> by purchasing conforming goods or <u>demand</u> conforming goods.<strong></strong></li>
    <li><strong>REMEDY OF NON-BREACHING SELLER (UCC):</strong> A non-breaching seller may
      <ol>
        <li>Demand payment of the <u>contract price</u> (specific performance) if the goods are <u>custom made</u> and unsuitable for resale,</li>
        <li>Demand payment of the excess of <u>contract price over the market price</u> if the goods can be resold,<u></u></li>
        <li><u>Sell the goods at salvage</u> after <u>notice</u> and demand the excess of the <u>contract price over salvage price,</u> or</li>
        <li>Demand <u>lost profits</u> if the goods cause a <u>lost volume situation</u>.</li>
      </ol>
      <strong></strong></li>
    <li><strong>REQUIREMENTS CONTRACTS (UCC): </strong>A requirements contract is an agreement that a buyer will buy <u>all amounts needed</u> from a seller. The quantity is defined by the reasonable expectations of the parties. [Note: This is NOT an agreement that the buyer can buy "all he wants" or "all he orders". It MUST be an agreement the buyer will buy all he NEEDS because otherwise the buyer is not being bound to anything at all and the whole contract becomes illusory.] <strong></strong></li>
    <li><strong>UCC 2-201 (UCC): </strong>A contract for goods worth <u>$500 or more</u> must be evidenced by sufficient written evidence to show a contract formed, <u>signed</u> by (or otherwise bearing markings identifiable to) the party against whom the contract is to be enforced. But between MERCHANTS a <u>sales confirmation</u> by one listing quantity will bind both parties if the receiving party does not object within 10 days. The rule does not apply to 1) <u>special made goods,</u> 2) if the party to be bound <u>admits the existence of the contract</u> (in pleadings, in deposition or in court), or 3) to the extent there has been <u>partial performance</u> by <u>acceptance of payment or goods</u>.<strong></strong></li>
    <li><strong>UCC 2-205 (UCC): </strong>A <u>firm offer</u> in a <u>signed writing</u> by a <u>merchant</u> that by its terms <u>assures</u> it will not be revoked is <u>irrevocable for the stated time</u>, or if no time is stated for a <u>reasonable time</u> given the circumstances, without the need for consideration, but can be revoked after three months in any event. <strong></strong></li>
    <li><strong>UCC 2-206 (UCC): </strong>An acceptance may be made in any <u>reasonable manner</u>, including a <u>promise</u> to ship or <u>shipment</u> of either conforming or non-conforming goods, but a shipment of <u>non-conforming</u> goods as an <u>express accommodation</u> is not an acceptance.<strong></strong></li>
    <li><strong>UCC 2-207 (UCC): </strong>An acceptance containing varying terms is an effective acceptance, but the varying terms will NOT be included in the contract if 1) the offer <u>expressly </u><u>limited</u> acceptance and the offeror does not agree to the new terms, OR 2) the parties are not <u>both merchants</u>, OR 3) if they are both merchants the varying terms <u>materially alter</u> the contract OR 4) if not a material alteration the party to be bound <u>expressly and timely objects</u> in writing to the change in contract terms.</li>

    <td valign="top"><p>Lucy owned a rent house. She advertised in the newspaper to find a renter, citing rent of $700 a month. </p>
      <p>Homer saw the ad and called Lucy at 9:00 a.m. Homer said, &ldquo;&quot;I saw your ad and accept your offer! I will be right there to pay you. I have to see the house, but would you consider $550?&rdquo; </p>
      <p>Lucy said, &ldquo;It's a deal. I will rent to you for $550. This is a firm offer.&rdquo; Homer said he would be there in one hour to see the house. </p>
      <p>Homer went 100 miles an hour to see the house, sideswiping Victoria. Victoria crashed and died along with her 7-month fetus. </p>
      <p>At 3:00 p.m. Homer arrived, five hours late, ran up to Lucy and said, &ldquo;I unequivocally accept. Here is my $550.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>Lucy said, &ldquo;I have decided not to rent to you.&rdquo; Discuss the rights of Homer and Lucy's defenses. </p></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>HOMER VS LUCY</p>
      <p>The rights and remedies of the parties depend on whether or not there was a valid contract. A contract is a promise or set of promises the performance of which the law will recognize as a duty and for which the law will provide a remedy. </p>
      <p>1. UCC?</p>
      <p>UCC Article 2 governs contracts for <strong>sale</strong> of GOODS, <strong>movable</strong> things at the time of identification to the contract. Otherwise, only COMMON LAW governs the contract. </p>
      <p>Here the contract does not concern a <strong>sale</strong> of <strong>movable things </strong>because it is for the &quot;rent&quot; of a &quot;house&quot;. </p>
      <p>Therefore, only COMMON LAW principles govern this contract.</p>
      <p>2. Is a WRITING REQUIRED?</p>
      <p>Under the STATUTE OF FRAUDS certain types of contract must be in writing to be enforced. A contract for conveyance of an interest in LAND often requires a writing, but not leaseholds of a year or less.</p>
      <p>Here the question involves conveyance of an interest in land because the alleged agreement was to rent a &quot;house&quot;, but this appears to be a month-month rental.</p>
      <p>Therefore, a writing would not generally be required. </p>
      <p>3. Was the ADVERTISEMENT an OFFER?</p>
      <p>Under contract law an OFFER is a <strong>manifestation of present intent </strong>to enter into a bargain <strong>communicated</strong> to the offeree and sufficiently specific that an observer would reasonably believe assent would form a bargain. Advertisements are generally not offers because they usually fail to identity the parties or the quantity being offered. </p>
      <p>Here the advertisement was <strong>not specific</strong> as to the parties because it did not guarantee that Lucy would rent to the first person to respond. </p>
      <p>Therefore, the advertisement was not an offer. </p>
      <p>4. Was the 9:00 statement by Homer an OFFER?</p>
      <p>Offer is defined supra</p>
      <p>Here the statement by Homer did not appear to <strong>manifest intent</strong> to enter into a bargain because  even though he said, &quot;I accept&quot; he added that he &quot;had to see the house first&quot;. No reasonable person would believe assent to that statement would form a bargain because it was clear he wanted to &quot;see the house first&quot;. </p>
      <p>Therefore the statement was not an offer. </p>
      <p>5. Was the 9.00 response by Lucy an OFFER?</p>
      <p>Offer is defined supra</p>
      <p>Here the statement by Lucy did  manifest intent to enter into a bargain because she said &quot;It's a deal, I will rent to you for $550.&quot; A reaonable person would believe assent to that statment  would form a bargain.</p>
      <p>Therefore that statement was an offer.</p>
      <p>6. Did Homer have a valid OPTION?</p>
      <p>Offer is defined supra. Under common law an OPTION is a contractual agreement that an offeror will not revoke an offer for a specific period of time <strong>in exchange for CONSIDERATION from the offeree</strong>. CONSIDERATION is an <strong>exchange</strong> of promises posing <strong>legal detriment</strong> such that the law deems it sufficient to support an agreement. </p>
      <p>Here Lucy promised to give a &quot;firm offer&quot;, but Homer <strong>gave no promise or value in exchange</strong>. While the UCC provides for &quot;firm offers&quot; from merchants, the UCC does not govern here. Therefore, Lucy received no legal consideration in exchange for her promise to give a &quot;firm offer&quot; and her promise cannot be enforced against her as an option contract.</p>
      <p>Therefore, Lucy's offer did not create an option contract, and she could revoke her offer at any time.</p>
      <p>7. Did Homer effectively ACCEPT at 3.00?</p>
      <p>At common law an acceptance must be an<strong> unequivocal assent </strong>to the <strong>terms</strong> of an offer, dispatched to the offeror in the manner required, or if no manner is required in the offer, by the means by which the offer <strong>was dispatched</strong> or some <strong>faster</strong> means. An offer must be accepted before it <strong>LAPSES</strong>. Unless there is an option, an offer lapses in the time stated or if no <strong>time stated</strong> within a <strong>reasonable time </strong>after the offer is made. </p>
      <p>Here the reasonable time for acceptance of Lucy's offer is defined by the understanding that Homer would view the house in only one hour at &quot;10:00&quot;. That understanding established the &quot;reasonable time&quot; within which Homer could accept the offer. But Homer was &quot;five hours late,&quot; as Lucy's offer had already lapsed when he arrived. Homer's attempt to unequivocally accept Lucy's 9:00 offer by saying &quot;I unequivocally accept&quot; was ineffective because he could not accept an offer that had already lapsed.</p>
    <p>Therefore, Homer's attempt to accept was ineffective. </p></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>[Explanation: This question is a typical FORMATION question because it goes through a series of communications between the parties. When you see messages going back and forth, it is a FORMATION question, so analyze each message.</p>
      <p>Start with an INTRODUCTORY DEFINITION of a contract. Then chronologically analyze each communication to see if it is an OFFER. Once there is an offer, the next issue is whether the offer is ACCEPTED.</p>
      <p>If there is offer and an acceptance a contract forms and the next issue is the TERMS of the contract.</p>
    <p>After the contract terms are discussed the next issue is whether there has been a BREACH. And if there is a berach, the issues are WHO BREACHED and the REMEDIES of the parties.] </p></td>

    <td valign="top"><p>Al had bought a lot of clothes over the years. One day he called tailor Bob and asked him to custom make him a tuxedo to wear to the wedding of his daughter Carla the next Sunday. </p>
      <p>Bob told Al that he could not make a tuxedo so fast and suggested instead that Al buy a ready- made tuxedo that he had in stock in exactly Al's size. Al agreed and said he would be in to pick it up later that week. Price was not discussed. </p>
      <p>Bob sent Al a note several days later stating, &quot;This is to confirm your order to purchase the tuxedo. The price is normally $750, but for you the price is only $519.95.&quot; </p>
      <p>Al was shocked at the price, but it was too late for him to get a tuxedo anywhere else on such short notice. He felt he had been taken advantage of, but there was nothing he could do. </p>
      <p>Al came in and tried the tuxedo on the day before the wedding and it did not fit. Bob assured him not to worry. He would take it in. Al nodded. </p>
      <p>Bob took in the pants and sent Al a note that said, &quot;I took in the pants and it should fit you like a glove. With alterations the price is now $750. </p>
      <p>Al was furious. </p>
      <p>Carla's wedding was suddenly called off. Al never called Bob and never went to get the tuxedo. Bob was furious. </p>

          <p>BOB v. AL </p>
          <p>The rights and remedies of the parties here depend on whether there was a valid contract. A CONTRACT is a promise or set of promises the performance of which the law will recognize as a duty and for the breach of which the law will provide a remedy. </p>
          <p>1) UCC? </p>
          <p>Article 2 of the UCC governs contracts for the sale of GOODS, movable things at the time of identification to the contract. </p>
          <p>Here the contract is for sale of a moveable thing because it was for sale of a &ldquo;tuxedo&rdquo;. Therefore this was a contract for a sale of goods and the UCC governs. </p>
          <p>2) MERCHANTS? </p>
          <p>Under the UCC MERCHANTS are people who deal in the goods or hold themselves out by occupation as knowledgeable about the goods in a contract. </p>
          <p>Here Bob deals in tuxedos because he has a clothing store. Al may have "bought a lot of clothes " but there is no evidence he deals in tuxedos or hold himself out by occupation as being particularly knowledgeable about them. </p>
          <p>Therefore Bob is a merchant and Al is not. 3) Is A WRITING NEEDED? </p>
          <p>Under UCC 2-201 a contract for the sale of GOODS over $500 requires a writing. This limit is being raised to $5,000 but many States are still using the $500 limit. Under the UCC a contract between MERCHANTS may satisfy the need for a writing against both parties if there is a sales confirmation indicating the quantity sent to one party by the other and the receiving party does not object to the representation of a contract. </p>
          <p>Further, under the UCC there is no need for a writing if goods are custom made, the person to be bound acknowledges the contract in a legal setting or where a party has accepted payment or goods. </p>
          <p>Here the goods are over $500 because the tuxedo costs "$519.95." And Al is not a merchant as shown above. </p>
          <p>Further, this was a "ready-made" tuxedo, not custom made, and Al never acknowledged the contract in a legal setting or accepted the goods. </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
    </div>
      <div title="Page 85">
        <div>
          <div>
            <p>4) Did Bob OFFER to sell the tuxedo? </p>
            <p>Under contract law an OFFER is a manifestation of present contractual intent communicated to the offeree that is so specific that an objective observer would reasonably believe assent would form a bargain. </p>
            <p>Here Bob manifested an intent to sell a tuxedo because he "suggested Al buy" the tuxedo. And a reasonable person would believe assent to this communication would form a bargain. </p>
            <p>Therefore, Bob made an offer. </p>
            <p>5) Did Al ACCEPT Bob's offer? </p>
            <p>Under the UCC acceptance of an offer can be made by any reasonable means showing assent to an offer. </p>
            <p>Here Al showed assent by a reasonable means because he " agreed". Therefore, Al accepted Bob's offer. </p>
            <p>6) What were the TERMS of the bargain? </p>
            <p>Under the UCC the subject matter, quantity and parties must be specified for a contract to be sufficiently certain, but all other terms can be supplied by the UCC&rsquo;s GAP FILLERS. </p>
            <p>Here the parties are Al and Bob and the subject matter is one tuxedo that is to be "exactly Al's size." Although price was not agreed upon that term would be inferred by the normal price for such goods. If $519.95 was the normal price of the tuxedo, it would be the price supplied by the UCC. The place of delivery was Bob's store and the time of delivery was agreed to be "later in the week." </p>
            <p>Therefore the TERMS of the contract were sufficiently certain for it to be enforced. 7) BREACH? </p>
            <p>Under the UCC PERFECT TENDER RULE goods must be delivered exactly as ordered. A seller that gives notice of intent to CURE a shipment of non-conforming goods has a right to cure within the contract period and a right to extra time to cure if non-conforming goods were delivered with a reasonable belief they were suitable for the buyer's needs. </p>
            <p>Here Bob delivered non-conforming goods because the tuxedo was not an "exact fit" as promised. Bob gave notice of intent to cure, and had time within the contract period to cure the lack of fit. </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div></div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div title="Page 86">
        <div>
          <div>
            <p>Therefore, Bob breached, but had a right to cure the breach. Was the contract MODIFIED to a higher price? </p>
            <p>Under the UCC a modification of a contract by agreement between the parties does not require additional consideration. </p>
            <p>Here Al did not agree to pay a higher price because he only "nodded" agreement to the need for alterations. The alterations were so that Bob could cure his breach, and while Bob has a right to cure his breach, he has no right to charge Al for the alterations. Further, Al did not agree to modify the original contract terms. </p>
            <p>Therefore, the contract was not modified to a higher price. </p>
            <p>8) Can Al raise the LACK OF WRITING as a defense?<br/>
              As discussed above, Bob could not enforce the contract unless he had a signed writing from Al. No facts show that Al ever signed any writing to buy the tuxedo.<br/>
              Therefore, Bob cannot force Al to pay for the tuxedo. </p>
            <p>9) FRUSTRATION OF PURPOSE? </p>
            <p>Under contract law, if the parties enter into a contract knowing that the failure of some condition beyond their control will deny one of the parties the benefit of the bargain, that condition is an implied material condition of the contract, the failure of which excuses both parties from the agreement. </p>
            <p>Here Bob knew that if the wedding of Al&rsquo;s daughter was cancelled it would deny Al the benefit of the bargain because he wanted the tuxedo to &ldquo;wear to the wedding.&rdquo; </p>
            <p>Therefore, Al can claim frustration of purpose excuses him from the contract. </p>
          </div>

    <td valign="top"><div title="Page 84">
      <div>
        <div>
          <p><strong>UCC and Acceptance Varying Terms</strong></p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
      <p>[Explanation: This is a UCC question, obviously. Bob breached by delivering non-conforming goods that failed to provide a perfect fit, as promised. But he has time to cure, and gave notice he intended to cure.</p>
      <p>If Al wants out of the deal, he can claim a lack of writing. He can do that because he is not a merchant, and the &quot;sale confirmation&quot; does not apply to him. He would be a merchant if he were a collector or hobbyist. But just buying lots of clothes doesn't make him a merchant any more than you are a merchant because you have bought a lot of groceries.</p>
    <p>And Al also possibly can claim frustration of purpose.] </p></td>

Harpo promised the new car would be delivered by Chico's birthday within two weeks. Chico was ecstatic.

        <p>Harpo made a deal with another dealer, Swifty. Swifty agreed to deliver a Dodge of the type specified on time for Chico's birthday in exchange for an immediate payment of $20,000. </p>
      <p>Swifty became insolvent, its inventory was seized and it did not deliver the Dodge. Harpo blames Swifty.<br/>
        Chico was upset he didn't get the car he expected.<br/>
        What are the rights, remedies and defenses of Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Swifty? </p></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>The rights and remedies of the parties here depend on whether there was a valid contract. A CONTRACT is a promise or set of promises the performance of which the law will recognize as a duty and for the breach of which the law will provide a remedy.</p>
        <p>1. UCC?</p>
      <p>UCC Article 2 governs the contracts for the <strong>sale</strong> of GOODS, <strong>movable</strong> things at the time of identification to the contract.</p>
      <p>Here the question involves a <strong>sale</strong> of a &quot;car&quot; and it is <strong>movable</strong> because it was to be delivered.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the UCC applies here. </p>
      <p><strong>GROUCHO v. HARPO</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2. Groucho's rights under a THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY CONTRACT?</strong><br>
            <br>
        Under contract law a THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY CONTRACT is one with main <strong>purpose</strong> of providing a <strong>benefit to a thrid party</strong>. The contract can be enforced by the original party, the promisee, or by a vested intended beneficiary. <br>
        <br>
        A beneficiary may be a DONEE (of a gift) or a CREDITOR (payment of debt) beneficiary. The beneficiary <strong>vests</strong> upon becoming aware of and changing position in reliance on the contract. <br>
        <br>
        Here the <strong>purpose</strong> of the contract is to <strong>benefit</strong> Chico because he was to get a &quot;new Dodge&quot; as a &quot;birthday present.&quot; Therefore this is a third-party benefit contract. Chico is intended DONEE beneficiary because it is a &quot;birthday present&quot;.<br>
        <br>
        Groucho is the promisee because Harpo promised to &quot;deliver&quot; the car in &quot;two weeks&quot;. Harpo is the <strong>promisor</strong> because he has promised to deliver the car to Chico. <br>
        <br>
        Therefore, this is a third-party beneficiary contract, and Groucho as promisee can enforce it. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>3. Groucho's REMEDIES?</strong><br>
        <br>
        Under the PERFECT TENDER RULE of the UCC a non-breaching buyer in a non-delivery situation can demand conforming goods, repudiate the contract or by goods to cover and demand the excess of the cover price over the contract price. <br>
        <br>
        Here Harpo has breached because he did not deliver the promised car.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, Groucho can demand delivery from Harpo or repudiate the contract and demand return of his $2,000. If he covers by buying the car elsewhere he can demand the excess of his cover price, if any, over the contract price. </p>
      <p><strong>GROUCHO V. SWIFTY</strong></p>
      <p><strong>4. Groucho's rights under the DELEGATION contract?</strong><br>
        Under contract law, a DELEGATION is a second contract conveying the duty of performance under the first contract from the original promisor to a delegatee. The promisor in the first contract retains primary liability to the promisee.
        The delegatee assumes secondary liability to the promisee of the first contract if she expressly accepts the delegation in exchange for consideration, a bargained for exchange of value creating legal liability. In the delegation contract between the promisor / delegator and the delegatee the original promisee is a CREDITOR third-party beneficiary with standing to enforce the contract.<br>
          <br>
        A delegatee can raise all defenses that are available to the promisee in the original contract.<br>
        <br>
        Here there is a delegation contract between Harpo and Swifty supported by consideration because Swifty expressly accepted the duty by saying he &quot;agreed to deliver&quot; in exchange for an &quot;immediate payment of $20,000&quot;.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, Groucho has standing to enforce Swifty's promise to deliver the car as a creditor third party beneficiary.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>5. Groucho's REMEDIES against Swifty?</strong><br>
        A promisee under a contract can enforce the delegation contract as an intended third-party beneficiary in the same way as the original promisee of the delegation agreement (Harpo).<br>
        <br>
        Here Gruocho's remedies against Swifty are the same as his remedies against Harpo, and Groucho can recover from Swifty any amounts he cannot recover from Harpo. </p>
      <p><strong>HARPO V. SWIFTY</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6. Harpo's rights under the DELEGATION contract?</strong><br>
        Delegation is defined above.<br>
        <br>
        Here the delegation from Harpo to Swifty is a contract between them because Swifty promised &quot;to deliver the car&quot;, and it is a legal contract supported by consideration because Swifty received an &quot;immediate payment of &quot;$20,000&quot;. Swifty was the promisor and Harp the promisee.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, Harpo can enforce his contract with Swifty and seek recovery from Swifty for any damages due Groucho and / or Chico. </p>
      <p><strong>CHICO V. HARPO</strong></p>
      <p><strong>7. Chico's rights as a THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY?</strong><br>
        <br>
        Third party beneficiary contracts are defined above. Chico is an intended third-party beneficiary because the known purpose of the original contract was to give him a &quot;birthday present&quot;. He vested when he became aware of the original contract and changed position in reliance.<br>
        <br>
        A vested third-party beneficiary can enforce the contract against the promisor in the same manner as the promisee.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, Chico can enforce the original contract against Harpo in the same manner and extent as Groucho.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>8. Chico's REMEDIES</strong><br>
          <br>
        Chico's remedies would be the same as Groucho. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>CHICO V. SWIFTY</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>9. Chico's rights and remedies against Swifty?</strong><br>
        <br>
        Since Swifty agreed to perform the duties of Harpo, Swifty assumed the same liability as Harpo. And since Chico has the same enforcement rights as Groucho, Chico's rights and remedies to enforce the contract against Swifty are the same as against Harpo. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>CHICO V. GROUCHO</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>10. Chico's rights and remedies against Groucho?</strong><br>
          <br>
        A donee beneficiary cannot enforce the promise of a gift against the promisee at law and can only enforce at equity based on promissory estoppel.<br>
        <br>
        Here Groucho entered into the contract with Harpo to give Chico a GIFT, so Chico was a DONEE beneficiary. Where there is no evidence Groucho has breached the contract with Harpo, and even if he did Chico would have no right to enforce the contract against Groucho at law.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, if Groucho had refused to perform the contract (e.g. had refused to make the car payments) Chico could only plead equity against Groucho based on principals of promissory estoppel.

            <p>[ANSWER EXPLANATION: The point of this question is that a contract intended to benefit a third party (Chico) can be enforced against the promisor (Harpo) by both the intended beneficiary (Chico) and the promisee (Groucho). Further, a delegation contract supported by consideration (a legally binding contract and not just a gift promise) can be enforced by the delegator (Harpo) against the delegatee (Swifty) and also by the promisee (Groucho) and intended beneficiary (Chico). </p>
            <p>But if the promisee&rsquo;s effort (Groucho&rsquo;s effort) to bestow benefit on the beneficiary (Chico) is gratuitous, the donee beneficiary cannot enforce the original contract (Groucho-Harpo contract) against the promisee (Groucho) at law. The donee beneficiary could only plead promissory estoppel or detrimental reliance against the promisee in equity, given evidence to support such a claim. </p>
            <p>If the contract is for a sale of goods, as is the case here, the UCC also governs the remedies of the parties at law, but the equitable remedies would generally remain the same as at common law. </p>
            <p>You should identify each party as promisee, promisor, delegatee, donee/creditor beneficiary, etc. because that designation determines their RIGHTS and REMEDIES (just as the call of the question asks.) </p>

    <td valign="top"><p>When Al was in high school he wrote and copyrighted a rap song called &quot;Dumb and Dead.&quot; He submitted his song to talent agent Tom. On January 1, two days before his seventeenth birthday, he and Tom reached a valid oral agreement that Tom could have exclusive recording rights until Al was 18 years old. Tom was to receive 25 percent of &quot;sales.&quot; </p>
      <p>Tom sent Al a signed, written &quot;sales confirmation&quot; of their agreement that gave all of the details of the agreement. The memo pointed out that records are &quot;goods&quot; under the UCC. After this Al performed completely under the terms of the agreement. </p>
      <p>Tom pitched Al's song to Deccra Records telling them Al was 19 years old, an adult. Following negotiations by Tom, Deccra and Al signed a written agreement on March 1 that Al would receive 50 percent of gross record sales over the next three years. Deccra was aware that Tom would receive a portion of this money under his contract with Al. </p>
      <p>Before Deccra paid anything it discovered Al was only 17. A Deccra executive secretly met with Al and told him the company would not stand by its first agreement, and an alternative agreement was proposed that would benefit both parties. Al agreed on April 1 to a new arrangement under which he got 40 percent of gross record sales, Deccra got 60 percent and Tom was cut completely out. </p>
      <p>The song went straight to the top of the charts and Deccra's sales were $1.6 million in the next year. Of this amount Deccra paid Al $640,000, 40 percent of gross sales. Deccra's distribution expenses were $360,000, and it made profits of $600,000. Tom got nothing. </p>
      <p>Tom got a lawyer and sued both Al and Deccra. </p>
      <p>Al also went to a lawyer. Six months after becoming an adult on his eighteenth birthday he sued Deccra claiming he was a minor when the contract was signed. He demanded return of all remaining revenues, $960,000. </p>

        <div>
          <p>TOM v. AL<br/>
            1. Was the contract of January 1 unenforceable by Tom because it was oral? 1) UCC? </p>
          <p>UCC Article 2 governs the sale of goods, moveable things at the time of identification to the contract. But UCC Article 1 generally requires a written contract signed by the party to be bound for any sale of personal property that is not goods in excess of $5,000. </p>
          <p>Here Tom claimed the records were &ldquo;goods&rdquo; but the contract was not for the sale of anything movable because it was for the sale of &ldquo;recording rights&rdquo;. But it was for a sale of personal property because it was for &ldquo;exclusive recording rights.&rdquo; The value of the contract was not stated to be over $5,000, and it might be argued that on that basis Article I would not require a writing at the time of execution, even though the song later became popular. </p>
          <p>Therefore UCC Article 2 would not require this contract to be in writing, and it is arguable that Article 1 would not require a writing because the contract was not clearly in excess of $5,000 at the time of execution. </p>
          <p>2) Statute of Frauds? </p>
          <p>Under the STATUTE OF FRAUDS a contract that necessarily takes more than a year to complete from the time of formation must be in writing to be enforceable at law. But if an oral agreement that fails to satisfy the statute is partially or fully performed, it may be enforceable at equity to the extent necessary to prevent injustice. To plead equity one must have &ldquo;clean hands&rdquo;. </p>
          <p>Here the contract would necessarily take more than a year because it was entered "two days before" Al was 17 and it was to last until he was "18". That is more than a year. </p>
          <p>Therefore, the Statute of Frauds required a writing even if Article 1 of the UCC did not. Al only agreed to the contract orally, so and the contract was not enforceable against him at law because it was oral. </p>
          <p>Further, Tom would be unable to plead &ldquo;clean hands&rdquo; because he appears to have taken advantage of Al, a minor, and to have lied to Deccra about Al&rsquo;s age. </p>
          <p>Therefore Tom would be unable to enforce the oral agreement against Al at either law or equity. 2. Was the contract of January 1 enforceable against Tom by Al?</p>
          <p>3) STATUTE OF FRAUDS?<br/>
            The Statute of Frauds is defined above. </p>
          <p>Here Tom sent Al a &ldquo;signed&rdquo; confirmation that &ldquo;gave all the details&rdquo;. And Al also has &ldquo;performed completely&rdquo;. </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
      <div title="Page 92">
        <div>
          <div>
            <p>Therefore there may be sufficient &ldquo;writing&rdquo; signed by Tom that the Statue of Frauds might be satisfied. </p>
            <p>Otherwise Al would probably be able to enforce the contract against Tom at equity to the extent necessary to avoid injustice. </p>
            <p>4) Enforceable by a MINOR? </p>
            <p>Under contract law a contract, except for necessities of life, cannot be enforced at law against a party which lacked legal capacity at the time of execution. But if a legal incapacity is removed the party to be bound must repudiate the contract within a reasonable period of time or they will be deemed to have affirmed or ratified it. The period of time in which a party gaining legal capacity must repudiate a contract may be set by statue. </p>
            <p>A party lacking capacity can enforce a contract against a party that does not lack capacity. </p>
            <p>Here Al lacked capacity at the time of execution because it was &ldquo;two days before his seventeenth birthday&rdquo;. But that does not prevent Al from enforcing the contract against Tom who did not lack capacity. </p>
            <p>Therefore the contract is enforceable by Al, even though he is a minor. AL v. DECCRA<br/>
              3. Was the contract of March 1 enforceable by Al against Deccra?<br/>
              5) FRAUD? </p>
            <p>Under contract law FRAUD is a defense to enforcement of a contract where a party 1) deliberately misrepresented material facts, 2) the party raising the defense reasonably relied on the misrepresentations, and 3) the party to be bound would not have entered into the contract but for the misrepresentation. </p>
            <p>Here Tom deliberately misrepresented facts because he said Al was "19" knowing that Al was a minor. And this was a material fact since it represented Al had legal capacity to enter into a contract. And Decca reasonably relied on Tom's misrepresentation, and could probably prove it would not have entered the contract had it known the truth. </p>
            <p>Therefore, the contract of March 1 was unenforceable against Deccra.<br/>
              4. ISSUE -- Was the contract of April 1 enforceable by Deccra against Al? 6) EFFECTIVE REPUDIATION OF CONTRACT? </p>
            <p>As explained above a contract, except for necessities of life, cannot be enforced against a party lacking legal capacity at the time of execution. But if a party lacking capacity at the time of contract gains capacity, they must affirmatively repudiate the contract within a reasonable period </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div title="Page 93">
        <div>
          <div>
            <p>of time, or within the time set by statute, or they will be deemed to have affirmed or ratified the </p>
            <p>contract. </p>
            <p>Here Al lacked capacity to contract at the time of execution because he was a minor who was "only 17". </p>
            <p>Al later attempted to repudiate the contract "six months after becoming an adult." He would argue that this was within a &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; time after he gained capacity. And if this was within the statutory time period the repudiation was effective. Otherwise the contract may have been deemed automatically affirmed and the repudiation would be ineffective. </p>
            <p>If the repudiation was effective, Decca would generally be required to give to Al all money it had made on the sale of his song. </p>
            <p>Therefore, Deccra cannot enforce the contract if Al's repudiation was effective. </p>
            <p>5. If the contract of April 1 is legally unenforceable by Deccra, what equitable argument might it make? </p>
            <p>7) PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL?. </p>
            <p>Under the doctrine of PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL a party can seek enforcement of an otherwise unenforceable promise where 1) a party made a promise, 2) intending to induce reliance, 3) there was reasonable reliance by the other party and 4) injustice will result if the promise is not enforced.. </p>
            <p>Here Al made a promise to Deccra because he &ldquo;agreed on April 1 to a new arrangement&rdquo;, and he did that intending to induce reliance. </p>
            <p>Al would argue that Decca did not reasonably rely because it was aware Al was a minor and could repudiate the contract at any time. Deccra would argue that Al would reap an UNJUST ENRICHMENT because it incurred "$360,000 in distribution expense." </p>
            <p>Therefore, it would appear that Decca's restitution to Al should be reduced by this amount and restricted to the actual profit made by Decca. </p>

            <p>[ANSWER EXPLANATION: The most important thing this question teaches is how to "follow the call" of a STRUCTURED CALL while still addressing important issues the call fails to mention. </p>
            <p>While the CALL asks you about Tom&rsquo;s rights against Al, and Al&rsquo;s rights against Tom, and Al&rsquo;s rights against Deccra, and Deccra&rsquo;s rights against Al, you only have to state the parties twice: &ldquo;Tom v. Al&rdquo; and &ldquo;Al v. Deccra&rdquo;. It is simply a waste of time to state the parties again with their names switched around. </p>
            <p>The call of the question asks the validity of an oral contract. That requires you to immediately determine if the UCC applies. UCC Article 2 does not apply because this question does not involve the sale of goods, but Article 1 (1-206) may apply because it involves a sale of recording rights. Even if those do not apply, the Statute of Frauds applies because this is a contract that necessarily cannot be performed in less than a year. </p>
            <p>Remember oral contracts and contracts signed by minors may be valid but not enforceable. Or, they may be unenforceable at law but enforceable at equity. It depends on the facts. Even if a party cannot enforce the contract, they may get quantum meruit reimbursement if the other party would otherwise receive an unjust enrichment. </p>
            <p>Deccra&rsquo;s defense against enforcement of the March 1 contract could be stated as the issue of &ldquo;unilateral mistake&rdquo; where Tom knew Deccra was mistaken, but since Tom deliberately lied to Deccra about Al&rsquo;s age with intent to deceive &ldquo;fraud&rdquo; seems the more accurate issue statement.] </p>

          <p>WANDA v. HOMER </p>
          <p>The rights and remedies of the parties here depend on whether there was a valid contract. A CONTRACT is a promise or set of promises the performance of which the law will recognize as a duty and for the breach of which the law will provide a remedy. </p>
          <p>1) UCC? </p>
          <p>Article 2 of the UCC governs contracts for the sale of GOODS. GOODS are movable things at the time of identification to the contract. Otherwise only the common law applies. </p>
          <p>Here the contract does not involve a sale because it is a contract for personal services -- building a house. </p>
          <p>Therefore, only the COMMON LAW applies. </p>
          <p>2) Is a WRITING REQUIRED? </p>
          <p>Under the STATUTE OF FRAUDS certain types of contracts must be in writing to be enforced. A contract for conveyance of an interest in LAND generally requires a writing, and contracts that necessarily must take more than a year to complete require a writing. </p>
          <p>Here the contract is for building a house, and does not involve conveyance of an interest in land because Homer &ldquo;already owns&rdquo; the land. And the contract can be performed in less than a year because it was to be completed before the &ldquo;Winter rains&rdquo;. </p>
          <p>Therefore, no writing is required by the Statute of Frauds 3) MODIFICATION without CONSIDERATION? </p>
          <p>Under COMMON LAW a contract modification must be supported by CONSIDERATION, a bargained for exchange of value posing legal detriment sufficient to enforce the modification at law. </p>
          <p>Here the contract was modified because Homer promised to pay $30,000 more. But Bill did not give anything of value in exchange for that promise since he only agreed to do what he already had a PRE-EXISTING DUTY to do -- to build the house for $100,000. </p>
          <p>Therefore, the modification of the contract was not supported by consideration and it is unenforceable at law against Homer. </p>

        <div>

            <p>4) Enforceable by PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL? </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>
            <p>Under the theory of PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL an agreement that otherwise is unenforceable at law for a lack of consideration may be enforced at equity to the extent necessary to avoid injustice. In order to plead equity a party must have CLEAN HANDS. Promissory estoppel applies where the party to be bound made a 1) promise with 2) intent to induce reliance and there 3) was reasonable reliance and 4) failure to enforce the promise would cause an injustice. </p>
            <p>Here Homer made a promise because he "promised" to pay $30,000. And he did that with intent to induce reliance because Homer didn&rsquo;t want to &ldquo;live in a tent&rdquo;. Bill reasonably relied on Homer&rsquo;s promise because he "hired Fred" in "reasonable reliance" on the promise. But there is NO INJUSTICE because Bill was only induced by Homer's lie to do exactly what he was already legally obligated to do -- finish the house. Homer reaped NO UNJUST ENRICHMENT because he only got the house that he had already been promised, and had promised to pay for. </p>
            <p>Therefore, Bill was not induced to do anything he was not otherwise obligated to do, and Homer did not receive anything of value that he was not entitled to. </p>
            <p>Since there was no injustice, promissory estoppel would not apply. </p>
            <p>Further, Bill had UNCLEAN HANDS because he had a legal duty to perform under the contract, and he elicited Homer&rsquo;s promise to pay $30,000 more by threatening to breach the contract. A Court of equity will not act to enforce a promise elicited by a threat of illegal conduct. </p>
            <p>Therefore, Homer&rsquo;s promise to pay more cannot be enforced at either law or equity. </p>
            <p>5) Defense of IMPOSSIBILITY? </p>
            <p>Under contract law the defense of IMPOSSIBILITY excuses a breach where the performance of a contract has become impossible due to events beyond the control of the parties. Impossibility means that performance is physically impossible, and it constitutes a failure of an IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION of the agreement. </p>
            <p>Here finishing the house was not impossible because Homer finished it by hiring Paul. Therefore, Wanda cannot claim impossibility as a defense. </p>
            <p>6) BREACH? </p>
            <p>Under contract law a BREACH is a failure to perform contractual duties when they become due. A MAJOR BREACH is one which denies the non-breaching party the EXPECTED BENEFIT OF THE BARGAIN. A major breach completely excuses the non-breaching party from any further obligation under the contract. A MINOR BREACH is one where the breaching party has SUBSTANTIALLY PERFORMED. When there is a minor breach the non-breaching party must perform contractual duties but is entitled to an OFFSET as compensation for damages. </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div title="Page 97">
        <div>
          <div>
            <p>Here there was substantial performance because the home was all done "except for the painting". The minor breach cost Homer an additional $10,000, so he was entitled to an OFFSET in that amount. </p>
            <p>Therefore, Homer must pay Wanda the contract price less an offset of $10,000, a net payment of $90,000. </p>

          <div>
            <p>[ANSWER EXPLANATION: Don't let sympathy blind you. Effective modification of a common law contract (not UCC) requires an exchange of consideration. Here Bill receives a promise of $30,000, but Homer gets nothing. If Homer gets nothing, then he gets no consideration (no bargained for thing in exchange for his promise). </p>
            <p>Restatement 2nd provides that a &ldquo;good faith&rdquo; modification requires no consideration to be enforced at law. But that is not clearly &ldquo;broadly adopted&rdquo;. The general view seems to be that consideration is required to enforce a modification agreement at law, and without consideration it may only be enforced at equity to the extent necessary to avoid injustice. Besides, an agreement made &ldquo;under threat&rdquo; is hardly in good faith anyway. </p>
            <p>Consider a situation where Bill demands $30,000 more but also promises to paint the house a different color. In that case there would be a bargained for exchange of consideration, so Homer would have to argue he was forced to agree to pay more under duress, a different legal defense argument. But here that is not the case, so any argument of &lsquo;duress&rsquo; is unnecessary and irrelevant. </p>
            <p>For defenses, impossible means just that. If the non-breaching party can finish the job, so can the breaching party. </p>

    <td valign="top"><p>Dottie's father Fester called her one day and told her he had suffered a stroke. He was paralyzed from the scalp down. He asked her to come live with him and take care of him. He told her that if, and only if, she took care of him for the rest of his life he would leave her his entire estate in his will, including his house. He emphasized that Dottie could only accept his offer by doing what he asked, and that she could not accept by merely promising to take care of him. </p>
      <p>Dottie sold her home at a $50,000 loss and moved across the country to take care of Fester for the rest of his life. She gave up her $250,000 per year practice as a brain surgeon nursed Fester 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Similar care in a nursing home would have cost $40,000 per year. </p>

          <p>DOTTIE v. ESTATE OF FESTER </p>
          <p>The rights and remedies of the parties here depend on whether there was a valid contract. A CONTRACT is a promise or set of promises the performance of which the law will recognize as a duty and for the breach of which the law will provide a remedy. </p>
          <p>1. What are Dottie's remedies at law relative to the stock? 1) UCC? </p>
          <p>UCC Article 2 governs contracts for the sale of GOODS. GOODS are movable things at the time of identification to the contract. Otherwise only the common law applies. </p>
          <p>Here the contract is not for a sale of goods because it is an exchange of promises that Dottie will provide services and Fester will leave her his stock in his Will in exchange. </p>
          <p>Therefore, only the COMMON LAW governs. </p>
          <p>2) Is a WRITING REQUIRED? </p>
          <p>Under the STATUTE OF FRAUDS certain types of contracts must be in writing to be enforced. A contract for transfer of stock is not one of them. </p>
          <p>Therefore, no writing is required by the Statute of Frauds. </p>
          <p>3) UNILATERAL CONTRACT? </p>
          <p>Under contract law a UNILATERAL CONTRACT is proposed by an offer that unequivocally requires acceptance by performance and cannot be accepted merely by a promise of performance. </p>
          <p>Here this offer unequivocally required Dottie to "actually take care of " Fester for the rest of his life because Fester &ldquo;emphasized&rdquo; Dottie could not accept by merely &ldquo;promising&rdquo; to do what he asked. </p>
          <p>Therefore, this was an offer of a unilateral contract. </p>
          <p>4) SAVING DOCTRINES of a UNILATERAL CONTRACT? </p>
          <p>Under the common law an offeror could revoke her offer at any time before acceptance. Under that view Fester could revoke at any time, leaving Dottie without a remedy. Modernly SAVING DOCTRINES have been adopted to prohibit the offeror of a unilateral contract from revoking for a reasonable time after becoming aware that the offeree has begun performance in acceptance. </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
      <div title="Page 99">
        <div>
          <div>
            <p>Under an alternative view the offeror may revoke but the offeree has a right to RESTITUTION to </p>
            <p>avoid UNJUST ENRICHMENT. </p>
            <p>Here Dottie began performance in acceptance because she "sold her home", "moved" and "nursed Fester." And Fester was aware of her performance because he was alert despite his paralysis. </p>
            <p>Therefore, under the modern savings doctrines Dottie would usually be given a reasonable time to complete performance. Here a "reasonable time" is the rest of Fester's life, since that was the condition of the offer. </p>
            <p>5) BREACH OF IMPLIED COVENANT? </p>
            <p>Under contract law an IMPLIED COVENANT by each party to a contract is that they will not act to prevent the other party from performing contract duties and they will take reasonable steps to assure the other party enjoys the expected benefit of the bargain. Performance of this implied covenant is an IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION of every contract, </p>
            <p>Here Fester breached the implied covenant because he denied Dottie the opportunity to complete performance in acceptance. This caused a failure of an implied material condition because it totally denied her any of the benefits she expected from the contract. </p>
            <p>Therefore, Dottie can claim a MAJOR BREACH by Fester. </p>
            <p>6) Dottie's CONTRACT REMEDY? </p>
            <p>Under contract law remedies are COMPENSATORY to give the non-breaching party the benefit of the bargain, the compensation that had been bargained for. If property is UNIQUE money damages are in inadequate remedy and SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE is appropriate. </p>
            <p>Here the stock is not &ldquo;unique&rdquo; and money damages are adequate.<br/>
              Therefore Dottie's remedy is an award of money damages equal to the value of the stock. </p>
            <p>2. What are Dottie's remedies at law relative to the house? </p>
            <p>The same common law and savings doctrines apply to the house as for the stock as explained above. But under the STATUTE OF FRAUDS contracts for interests in land must be in writing to be enforced at law. </p>
            <p>7) STATUTE OF FRAUDS?<br/>
              The Statute of Frauds is defined above. </p>
            <p>Here the contract was for conveyance of an interest in land because the contract was for a &rdquo;house" to be given to Dottie in exchange for services. </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div title="Page 100">
        <div>
          <div>
            <p>Therefore, the Statute of Frauds would require a writing, and this contract generally cannot be enforced at law regarding the house. </p>
            <p>3. What are Dottie's remedies for enforcement at equity? </p>
            <p>8) PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL? </p>
            <p>If a plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law, they may be able to obtain a remedy in equity. Here Dottie has an adequate remedy at law as to the promise of the stock, so she cannot seek enforcement at equity as to that part of Fester&rsquo;s promise. But since she has no adequate remedy as to the promise of the house, she can seek a remedy at equity as to that part of her claim. </p>
            <p>Under the equitable doctrine of PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL a promise or contract that cannot be enforced at law might be enforced at equity to the extent necessary to prevent unjust enrichment where 1) the party to be bound made a promise ,2) intending to induce reliance, 3) there was reasonable reliance on the promise by the party seeking equity, and 4) justice demands enforcement. </p>
            <p>Here there was a promise because Fester "promised" to give Dottie the house. And Fester made the promise intending to induce reliance by Dottie because he wanted her to &ldquo;move" to where he lived and "nurse" him. Dottie reasonably relied because she trusted him as an "honest, God- fearing Christian." And there would be injustice otherwise because she nursed him for "10 years." </p>
            <p>To enforce the promise Dottie would argue that an award of money damages is insufficient to prevent unjust enrichment because the &ldquo;house&rdquo; is unique property. A Court of equity may order title to the house conveyed to her (EQUITABLE REPLEVIN) to prevent injustice. </p>
            <p>Therefore, Dottie may be able to enforce the promise in equity even though it could not be enforced at law. </p>
            <p>4. What are Dottie's remedies in alternative to enforcement? 9) EQUITABLE RESTITUTION? </p>
            <p>At equity a party that cannot enforce a promise at law or equity may still seek damages in RESTITUTION to prevent UNJUST ENRICHMENT. The measure of damages may be either the benefits their performance conveyed to the breaching party, or else the detriment they have suffered in reasonable reliance. </p>
            <p>Here Dottie can seek RESTITUTION for the benefits she conveyed to Fester. He enjoyed benefits that would have cost him $40,000 a year for ten years, so he enjoyed an unjust enrichment of $400,000. </p>
            <p>In the alternative Dottie suffered a loss of $50,000 on her house and foregone wages of $2,500,000 over the ten year period, for a total of $2,550,000. </p>

            <p>[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This call of this question is for a discussion of REMEDIES and yet the facts raise other issues that should be discussed first such as the Statute of Frauds. </p>
            <p>Always follow the call of the question, but you can use "sub-issues" as shown here to discuss necessary issues that the call does not mention. </p>
            <p>The first question asked in the call should settle the matter of the stock since Dottie has an adequate legal remedy as to that part of her claim. The last three questions deal with the promise of just the house, and as to that Dottie has no adequate legal remedy because the Statute of Frauds generally bars legal enforcement of an oral contract for conveyance of an interest in land. </p>
            <p>Another possible issue here is the &ldquo;part performance doctrine&rdquo; under which the Court will legally enforce an oral sales agreement for land in certain very narrow circumstances. The reason I don&rsquo;t discuss it in my sample answer is that it would so clearly fail that it did not seem an intended issue. That doctrine requires the &ldquo;buyer&rdquo; to take possession of the land in a manner that almost unequivocally proves an oral sales agreement. Here Dottie did not take possession; she shared possession. And nothing she did &ldquo;unequivocally&rdquo; showed any oral agreement to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; the land. </p>
            <p>Therefore, it appears Dottie&rsquo;s only remedies as to the promise of the house are at equity.] </p>

    <td valign="top"><div title="Page 102">
      <div>
        <div>
          <p>SELLCO v. BUYCO </p>
          <p>The rights and remedies of the parties here depend on whether there was a valid contract. A CONTRACT is a promise or set of promises the performance of which the law will recognize as a duty and for the breach of which the law will provide a remedy. </p>
          <p>1) Does the UCC apply? </p>
          <p>UCC Article 2 governs contracts for the sale of GOODS. GOODS are movable things at the time of identification to the contract. </p>
          <p>Here the question involves a sale of "widgets" and they are clearly moveable because they were to be &ldquo;delivered&rdquo;. </p>
          <p>Therefore, Article 2 of UCC applies. </p>
          <p>2) Are the parties MERCHANTS? </p>
          <p>Under the UCC MERCHANTS are people who deal in the goods or hold themselves out by occupation as knowledgeable about the goods in a contract. </p>
          <p>Here Sellco is clearly a dealer in these types of goods because it advertises them in its &ldquo;catalogue.&rdquo; Buyco is by occupation knowledgeable concerning &ldquo;widgets&rdquo; because of the large quantities it is ordering ($60,000). </p>
          <p>Therefore, the parties appear to be merchants. 3) Is there a NEED FOR A WRITING? </p>
          <p>Under UCC 2-201 a contract for the sale of GOODS over $500 requires a writing signed by the party to be bound unless an exception applies. This limit is being raised to $5,000 but many States are continuing to use the $500 limit. </p>
          <p>In a contract between MERCHANTS the need for a writing may be satisfied by a sales confirmation indicating the quantity sent to one party by the other if the receiving party has reason to know the contents of the writing and does not object to the representation of a contract within 10 days. </p>
          <p>Here a writing is needed because the cost of the goods is $60,000 ("10,000" at "$6"). But this is &ldquo;between merchants&rdquo; because both parties appear to be merchants, and the 6/4 sales confirmation Sellco sent to Buyco specifies quantity at &ldquo;10,000&rdquo;. That satisfies the requirement of 2-201. </p>
          <p>Therefore a writing was needed, but the need for a writing would be satisfied by the 6/4 message, unless Buyco objected within 10 days. </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
      <div title="Page 103">
        <div>
          <div>
            <p>4) Was the catalogue an OFFER? </p>
            <p>Under contract law an OFFER is a manifestation of present contractual intent communicated to the offeree that is so specific that an objective observer would reasonably believe assent would form a bargain. An advertisement is never a valid offer unless it clearly identifies the QUANTITY of goods for sale and the PARTY to whom the offeror is willing to sell them. </p>
            <p>Here the catalogue is not an offer because it is just a price list that does not specify the quantity of any product Sellco is willing to sell. No reasonable person would believe merely &lsquo;assenting&rsquo; to the catalogue would alone form a bargain, so a catalogue cannot be an &lsquo;offer&rsquo;.. </p>
            <p>Therefore, the catalogue itself is not an offer. </p>
            <p>5) 6/2/99 OFFER by Buyco? </p>
            <p>Offer is defined above. </p>
            <p>Here the communication from Buyco expresses present contractual intent because it says &ldquo;we hereby accept&rdquo;. The offer is specific as to parties because it says &ldquo;we&rdquo; and &ldquo;your&rdquo;, and it is specific as to a quantity of &ldquo;10,000&rdquo;. This is specific enough for an offer because it objectively appears assent would form a bargain. </p>
            <p>Therefore, this is a valid offer. </p>
            <p>6) 6/3/99 ACCEPTANCE? </p>
            <p>Under UCC 2-206 an offer that does not clearly require acceptance in a specific manner can be accepted in any reasonable manner including a promise to ship or shipment of conforming or non- conforming goods. </p>
            <p>Under UCC 2-207 an acceptance that includes varying terms is still effective. If the contract is between merchants the varying term proposed by the offeree may become part of the contract if the offer did not expressly require acceptance according to its terms, the offeror does not object to the varying terms within a reasonable time, and the varying terms are not a material alteration of the offer terms. </p>
            <p>Even when varying terms do not automatically become part of the contract they may become part of the contract by agreement, and the UCC allows modification without additional consideration. </p>
            <p>Here Sellco did not promise to ship in response to Buyco&rsquo;s offer because it said it "could provide" and not that it &ldquo;would&rdquo; provide the product. The word &ldquo;could&rdquo; does not imply any &ldquo;promise to ship&rdquo;. Therefore the response of Sellco was a rejection of Buyco&rsquo;s offer and and a counter-offer to sell on different terms. </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div title="Page 104">
        <div>
          <div>
            <p>Buyco&rsquo;s reaction to Sellco&rsquo;s offer to sell without warranty was an acceptance because Buyco &ldquo;verbally agreed.&rdquo; </p>
            <p>Even if one argues that Sellco accepted Buyco&rsquo;s offer with a varying term, Buyco still &ldquo;agreed&rdquo; to it, so that would have modified the contract to exclude the warranty term anyway. </p>
            <p>Therefore, there was an acceptance under either interpretation, and there is &ldquo;no warranty&rdquo; under either interpretation. </p>
            <p>7) TERMS? </p>
            <p>Under UCC Article 2 a goods contract is enforceable if quantity and parties are specified.. All other terms can be supplied by the UCC&rsquo;s GAP FILLERS. </p>
            <p>Here the parties are specified as Sellco and Buyco. The quantity is 10,000 yellow widgets at a price of $6 without a warranty for delivery on 6/8. </p>
            <p>Therefore the contract is specific enough to be enforced. </p>
            <p>8) BREACH? </p>
            <p>Under the PERFECT TENDER RULE of the UCC goods must be supplied exactly as ordered. Any non-conforming delivery is a major breach. </p>
            <p>A seller that delivers non-conforming goods has a right to GIVE NOTICE of intent to cure, and may CURE the shipment of non-conforming goods at any time within the contract period. Further, the seller gets a reasonable amount of extra time beyond the contract period if the original shipment was sent with a reasonable belief it would satisfy the buyer's needs. </p>
            <p>Here Sellco shipped non-conforming goods because it shipped "blue widgets". They were not sent with a reasonable belief they would satisfy the buyer&rsquo;s needs because they were sent by " mistake". And there is no time left to cure in the contract period because the shipment was on the deadline of "6/8/99&rdquo;, and </p>
            <p>Therefore, Sellco breached by shipping non-conforming goods, and has no time left to cure. </p>
            <p>9) Buyco's REMEDY? </p>
            <p>Under the UCC a buyer who receives nonconforming goods can REJECT the goods and REPUDIATE the contract. The buyer can COVER by buying the goods elsewhere and demand the excess of the cover price over the contract price, or demand the excess of market price over the contract price. </p>
            <p>Here Buyco had a right to reject the goods, and it covered at a price of $5. Since this is less than the $6 contract price, Buyco has suffered no loss as a result of the breach and has no right to receive damages from Sellco. </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div title="Page 105">
        <div>
          <div>
            <p>Therefore, Buyco's demand for $50,000 has no basis and they would get nothing. </p>
