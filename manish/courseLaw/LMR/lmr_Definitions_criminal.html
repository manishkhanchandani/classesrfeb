<p><strong>CRIMINAL LAW MNEMONICS</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. The MAJOR CRIMES = "That SCAB-RAT, Rob Burger, Attempted a Murder!"</strong></p>

    <li>SCAB – OFTEN SUBTLE OR HIDDEN ISSUES.
        <ol type="i">
          <li>Solicitation</li>
          <li>Conspiracy</li>
          <li>Assault</li>
          <li>Battery</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>RAT -- MORE OBVIOUS ISSUES.

          <li>Rape</li>
          <li>Arson (watch for smoke, fire, explosives, cutting torches)</li>
          <li>Theft (larceny, embezzlement, false pretenses)</li>

</ol>
<p><strong>2. BURGLARY: BEDONI </strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>At common law burglary was the <u>breaking</u> and <u>entry</u> of a <u>dwelling</u> of <u>others</u> in the <u>night</u> with <u>intent</u> to commit a felony. [Modernly the elements of dwelling and night have been broadly eliminated and a 'constructive breaking' is found when a <u>trespassory entry</u> is shown.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>3. AFFIRMATIVE DUTY TO ACT: </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SCRAP</strong> = When the defendant has an affirmative duty to act.
      <ul>

        <li><u>P</u>eril caused by defendant</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>[Although "duty" is usually associated with negligence and tort law it can also be an element the prosecution must prove in a criminal trial when the defendant is charged with <u>criminal negligence</u>.] </p>

<p><strong>SOME ISSUE SPOTTING EXAMPLES:</strong></p>
<blockquote><strong></strong>
    <p><strong>Example 1: </strong><em>"A invited B into his home. While A was called away B found a cutting torch and cracked open A's safe. He looked inside and saw A's credit card. He wrote down the credit card number and later used it to access porn on the internet from the comfort of his home. What is criminal liability of B?"</em></p>
  <strong></strong>
  <p><strong>Issues Presented:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>ARSON because he used a cutting torch, burning open a safe that was part of someone else's home. Was the safe part of the dwelling?</li>
    <li>BURGLARY, not when he went into A's house, because that was consensual, but because he broke ("cracked open") the "safe" which may be an interior room or compartment of a dwelling "A's home" for a theft ("false pretenses"). Was the safe big enough to be burgled? Did he "enter" or just "look" inside? Is false pretenses a felony or larceny sufficient for a burglary charge?</li>
    <li>FALSE PRETENSES because he unlawfully used A's "credit card number."</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>NOT trespass to chattels -- CRIMINAL LAW!</strong></p>
    <p><strong>NOT larceny -- nothing carried away!</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example 2: </strong><em>"Al was so depressed when his significant-other, Bob, moved out on him he drove around town in a total daze. When he saw Bob and Bud walking hand-in-hand, Al burst into tears and drove his car off the edge of the bridge and into the river. Unfortunately Captain Mitch was going under the bridge in his tug boat and he was killed when Al's car fell on him. Al says he blacked out, did not know what he was doing and cannot remember anything. What can Al be charged with (besides a poor choice of men) and what defenses can he raise?"</em></p>
  <p><strong>Issues Presented:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>MURDER based on depraved heart theory? Maybe. Isn't it unreasonably dangerous to "drive in a total daze"? Did he have any <u>awareness</u> of and <u>conscious disregard</u> for the unreasonably high risk to human life his acts posed while driving around in a daze? Certainly he was aware that someone could be killed with him driving around like that. What about suicide? Was he trying to kill himself? Is there a <u>transferred intent</u> where one attempts suicide and ends up killing someone else? No easy answer. Not clear if this was suicide or an accident.</li>
    <li>MANSLAUGHTER (negligent homicide). Very reckless driving in a daze. Al might claim "adequate provocation", but he was already driving around when he saw Bob and Bud. But even if he was <u>unaware</u> and <u>not conscious</u> of the risk his acts posed to others, he can be charged with manslaughter.</li>
    <li>INSANITY? Maybe Al can claim temporary insanity. If he "did not know what he was doing" and was "in a total daze" then he could not realize "the nature and quality of his acts or that it was wrong."</li>

<hr>
<p><strong>HOW TO PHRASE CRIMINAL LAW ISSUES</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. FIRST ANNOUNCE THE DEFENDANT. </strong>A criminal law answer should consist of issues below a heading that shows this case is the STATE versus each DEFENDANT. Underline this.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>For example: </strong><u>State v. John</u></p>
  <strong></strong>
  <p><strong>NEVER COMBINE DEFENDANTS. </strong>Start with the defendant that took the MOST ACTIVE PART in committing the crimes. After completing analysis of all crime issues relevant to that defendant, the analysis of the remaining defendants usually is reduced to questions of accomplice liability.</p>
  <p><strong>WHY ARE THERE MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS ANYWAY? </strong>Law professors do not mindlessly include multiple defendants in an exam question, and the sooner you realize that the better off you will be. The exam writer puts additional defendants into the fact pattern so that YOU will discuss the following: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The two crimes that require two or more people: SOLICITATION and CONSPIRACY;</li>
    <li>The fact that the WHARTON RULE prohibits charging only two defendants with conspiracy to engage in certain crimes like RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY or SELLING DRUGS;</li>
    <li>CONSPIRACY THEORY: That each member of a conspiracy is VICARIOUSLY LIABLE for crimes by other conspirators that are committed <u>during</u> the conspiracy and <u>within the scope</u> of the conspiracy; </li>
    <li>ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY THEORY: That each person that knowingly encourages or helps another person commit a crime becomes liable as an accomplice, not only for the crime they encouraged or helped commit but also VICARIOUSLY LIABLE for all crimes by the other accomplices that are the <u>direct and natural result</u> of the crime they helped commit;</li>
    <li>DEFENSES that might be raised by some but not all of the defendants such as WITHDRAWAL, INSANITY, INTOXICATION and INFANCY.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<strong></strong>
<p><strong>2. ORDER THE ISSUES.</strong> If the CALL of the question does not state and order the issues, you should usually discuss the issues in the ORDER EVENTS TAKE PLACE with the following exceptions:</p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>If there is MORE THAN ONE DEFENDANT and any <u>urging</u> by one for the other to commit any illegal act, discuss SOLICITATION at that point.</li>
    <li>If there is MORE THAN ONE DEFENDANT, discuss CONSPIRACY before discussing the crime that is the goal of the conspiracy (if there enough criminals -- Wharton Rule may require three).</li>
    <li>If there is MORE THAN ONE DEFENDANT analyze the crimes of the most culpable defendant first. Discuss the liability of secondary or marginal defendants second, with a focus on ACCOMPLICE and CONSPIRACY LIABILITY.</li>
    <li>If there is a DEATH, discuss MURDER after all lessor crimes such as robbery, but before MANSLAUGHTER. Focus on MALICE in the murder analysis.</li>
    <li>If there is a DEATH, also discuss MANSLAUGHTER as an alternative lessor offense that both the prosecution and defense might argue as a fallback position to a murder charge.</li>
    <li>Discuss PASSIVE DEFENSES (based on absence of an element of the crime) as part of your analysis of each crime issue itself.</li>
    <li>Discuss AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES (such as self-defense) after the analysis of each crime as a separate issue.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<strong></strong>
<blockquote><strong></strong>
    <p><strong>For example</strong>, if "Crazy Bob held up the bank and Dick helped him plan it," the structure of the answer would usually be:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong><em><u>People v. Bob</u></em></strong></p>
    <p><em>1) <u>CONSPIRACY?</u></em></p>
    <p><em>2)<u> ROBBERY?</u></em></p>
    <p><u><em>3) DEFENSE OF INSANITY?</em></u></p>
    <p><strong><u><em>People v. Dick</em></u></strong></p>
    <p><em>4<u>) CONSPIRACY LIABILITY for MURDER?</u></em></p>
    <p><em>5<u>)  ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY for ROBBERY?</u></em></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<strong></strong>
<p><strong>3. PHRASE ISSUE STATEMENTS FOR SIMPLE CONCLUSIONS.</strong> Phrase the issue so it can be answered simply. Ask if the defendant can be "charged," NOT whether he is "guilty." Remember, the defendant can almost always be <u>charged</u> with the crime by the District Attorney if the <u>elements</u> of the crime are shown by the facts.</p>
<p>I personally prefer a clear and complete statement of the issue. BUT the sample answers released by the Bar Association clearly show that a "one-word" issue like "CONSPIRACY?" is acceptable to them. But if you do present an abbreviated issue statement BE CERTAIN that you make it very clear in your application of the law to the facts <u>exactly what events you are referring to.</u></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>For example</strong>, if "Crazy Bob held up the bank and Dick helped him plan it," an acceptable answer structure might be:</p>
</blockquote>
<strong></strong>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em><u>People v. Bob</u></em></strong></p>
  <p><strong><em>1) <u>CONSPIRACY?</u></em></strong></p>
  <p>[Rule first and then...] "Here Bob <u>agreed</u> to <u>pursue an illegal goal</u> because he agreed to help Dick "hold up the bank" and that was an illegal goal." </p>

<p><strong>4. STATE THE VICTIM OR OBJECT OF THE CRIME.</strong> If there is more than one criminal act, or more than one possible victim, state the object or victim in the issue statement. If more than one person dies, discuss each death as a separate murder issue. If more than one structure is broken into (a house, a car, a safe, etc.) then discuss each break-in as a separate burglary issue.</p>
<ul>
  <li>NEVER present an issue of just "MURDER?" when <u>more than one person died</u>because the reader won't know which death you are talking about. Say <u>which</u> death you mean.</li>
  <li>NEVER just "BURGLARY?" when the defendant <u>entered more than one structure or room</u>, and each entry might be chargeable as a separate burglary. Say <u>which</u> break-in you mean.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. DON'T COMBINE ASSAULT AND BATTERY.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>NEVER ask if the defendant can be charged with "assault and battery".
      <ul>
        <li>ALWAYS analyze assault as a separate issue from battery.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ALWAYS refer to these <u>crimes</u> as "criminal assault" and "criminal battery" to make it clear you are not talking about the <u>torts</u> of "tortious assault" and "tortious battery."</li>
</ul>
<strong></strong>
<p><strong>6. DON'T FIND ANYONE <u>GUILTY</u> . </strong>Finding people guilty is not a lawyer's job. It is the job of the jury. You are a <u>law</u> student, so start thinking like a lawyer and not like a jury member. There are two attorneys at a criminal trial. The prosecutor decides what charges the evidence will support, and the defender decides what defenses the evidence will support. No attorney at a trial decides guilt or innocence. </p>
<ul>
  <li>So NEVER try to conclude the defendant is "guilty" of murder (unless the 'call' of the question demands it) because it is not your job, and it makes it awkward discussing other possible charges such as manslaughter. By the MERGER RULE the defendant cannot be found "guilty" of manslaughter if he/she has already been found "guilty" of murder. </li>
  <li>ALWAYS say the defendant can (or cannot) be "charged", then you can also argue he could be charged with lesser offenses as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>If the CALL of the question specifically asks, "Can D be found guilty of..." it is a <u>strong hint</u> that the given facts do NOT support the charge stated, and the Reader is testing whether or not you can figure that out. </p>
<strong></strong>
<p><strong>7. STATE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES AS SEPARATE ISSUES.</strong> There are two types of defenses, passive and affirmative.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The criminal prosecution must prove each and every element of a charged offense. A <u>passive defense</u> is an argument by the defense that the evidence fails to prove an element of a crime that must be proven by the prosecution . This should be analyzed in your analysis of whether the defendant can be charged at all.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>ALWAYS discuss the <u>passive defenses as part of your analysis</u> of whether the defendant can be <u>charged.</u></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>An <u>affirmative defense</u> is an entirely <u>separate issue</u> that the defendant should be <u>excused</u> from being found guilty. The defendant (not the prosecution) must prove each and every element of an affirmative defense.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>ALWAYS discuss <u>affirmative defenses as separate issues</u> AFTER you have concluded the defendant can be charged.</p>
    <p><strong>For example</strong>, if Victor attacks Dick with his fists, and Dick pulls out a gun and kills Victor, the <u>first issue</u> is, "ISSUE -- Can Dick be charged with MURDER?" The <u>second issue</u>, and it is a totally separate issue, is, "ISSUE -- Can Dick raise a defense of SELF-DEFENSE?"</p>

<p><strong>CRIMINAL LAW ISSUES AND ANSWERS - </strong></p>
<p>The following show how to <u>phrase and answer</u> the most common issues presented by law-school criminal law essay questions. Analyze each issue by <u>Nailing the Elements</u> as explained elsewhere. A full analysis and conclusion of the first issue is presented below as an example. The analysis and conclusion of the remaining issues has been omitted for brevity.</p>
<p><strong>A PRELIMINARY NOTE ON CAUSALITY</strong>: Some crimes do NOT require that the defendant produce any criminal result. For example, the crimes of solicitation, burglary, conspiracy and larceny are complete at the instant the defendant commits a criminal act, whether or not there is any injury at all to a 'victim'. But other crimes DO require that the defendant <u>actually cause</u> a criminal result or injury to a victim. For example, murder requires that the defendant cause the death of a victim.</p>
<p>It is always a big waste of time discussing causality in a criminal law essay answer if causality is clear. But, on occasion a criminal law essay question will pose a causation problem. Perhaps the defendant "kills" someone who was about to die anyway because of the acts of some second defendant. If a crimes question presents a causation issue of this type, this rule is what you need, and it is useful in both torts and crimes:</p>
<p><strong>ACTUAL CAUSATION RULE:</strong> A particular defendant is the ACTUAL CAUSE of a result if --</p>
<ol>
  <li>EITHER the result <u>would not have occurred</u> but for the particular defendant's act OR</li>
  <li>a) <u>two or more defendants</u> acted, b) <u>no result would have occurred if neither defendant had acted</u> AND c) <u>no evidence</u> shows the particular defendant did <u>not</u> cause the result.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>PROXIMATE CAUSATION RULE:</strong> A particular defendant is the PROXIMATE (legal) CAUSE of a result if it is the <u>direct and natural</u> (foreseeable) consequence. This concept gave rise to two rules, one of which now has limited application and one which is very powerful:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Year and a day: </strong>At common law a homicide could not be charged against a defendant unless the victim died within <u>a year and a day</u> from the date of the defendant's criminal act. Modernly this rule has often been extended by statute.</li>
  <li><strong>Tyler's Last, Unforeseeable, Intentional Act Rule: </strong>If <u>more than one act is an actual cause</u> of a result, the <u>LAST, UNFORESEEABLE, INTENTIONAL ACT</u> is generally held to be the proximate (legal) cause of the result and liability arising from the prior acts is generally cut off. This is a powerful rule with application to both crimes and torts.. </li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. SOLICITATION to commit [crime]?</strong></p>
<p>Under CRIMINAL LAW a SOLICITATION is  the crime of urging another person to commit a crime. The crime of SOLICITATION is complete as soon as the urging takes place, whether the person urged commits the crime urged or not. But if the urged crime is committed the SOLICITATION MERGES into the criminal result and the person committing the solicitation becomes an ACCESSORY BEFORE THE FACT  and VICARIOUSLY LIABLE for the crime based on accomplice  theory.  </p>
<p>Here A urge B to commit the crime of … because…Therefore, the defendant can be charged with solicitation to commit [crime]. </p>
<p><strong>2. CONSPIRACY to commit [crime or other illegal goal]?</strong><br>
  <br>

Under COMMON LAW the crime of CONSPIRACY was  an <strong>agreement</strong> between<strong> two or more</strong> people to work toward an <strong>illegal goal</strong>.  MODERNLY an <strong>OVERT ACT</strong> in furtherance of the conspiracy goal is often required in many Courts. <br><br>

Further, under the PINKERTON RULE , a member of a conspiracy is VICARIOUSLY LIABLE for the criminal acts of co-conspirators done WITHIN THE SCOPE of the conspiracy goal. This means crimes that were 1) <strong>foreseeable</strong> and 2) in <strong>furtherance</strong> of the conspiracy goal.<br><br>

Even if the illegal goal of the conspiracy is attained, the CONSPIRACY DOES NOT MERGE into the criminal result, so each member can be convicted of both conspiracy and the other crimes committed during and within the scope of the conspiracy .
<br><br>
<strong>[State the next paragraph if the conspiracy is to commit a crime that necessarily requires more than two people. Receiving stolen property is one of those crimes.]<br>
</strong><br>

And under the WHARTON RULE a  conspiracy requires the participation of more people than the minimum number necessary to commit the criminal act.
<br>
<strong><br>
[State the next paragraph if a defendant joins a conspiracy in progress.]  </strong><br><br>

If a defendant joins a conspiracy in progress most Courts hold they are not liable for previous crimes of the co-conspirators unless the joining defendant seeks to profit from those prior crimes.<br><br>

 <strong>[State the next sentence when crimes are committed after the conspiracy ends.]</strong><br><br>

 A conspiracy ends when the conspiracy goal is ATTAINED or ABANDONED, and vicarious liability  will no longer attach based on conspiracy theory . But it may still attach based on accomplice  theory.
<br><br>
 Here two or more parties, A and B, agreed to work toward an illegal goal because …And there was an OVERT ACT in furtherance of the conspiracy when ….
<br><br>
Therefore, the defendant can be charged with conspiracy to commit [crime].;</p>
<p>3. <strong>CRIMINAL ASSAULT?</strong></p>
<p>Under CRIMINAL LAW an ASSAULT is  the crime of <u>acting with the intention of causing a battery</u> or else <u>to cause apprehension</u> of a battery. The victim of the attempted battery does not have to be aware of the danger. <strong>Important!</strong></p>
<p><em> </em>Here the defendant <u>attempted to cause a battery</u> (or <u>apprehension of a battery</u>) because …</p>
<p><em> Therefore…</em></p>

  <p>4)      <u>Can the defendant be charged with CRIMINAL BATTERY</u> <u>?</u></p>
  <p> Under CRIMINAL LAW a BATTERY is  the crime of <u>acting with the intention of causing a touching of a victim’s person</u> and <u>causing a harmful or offensive touching</u> . <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p><strong>[Every criminal battery includes a criminal assault as a lesser included offense because an attempted battery is a criminal assault. The assault merges into the larger crime.]</strong></p>
  <p> Here the defendant <u>deliberately acted to cause a touching</u> because…And it caused a <u>harmful</u> (or <u>offensive</u>) <u>touching</u> because…Therefore…</p>
  <p>5)      <u>RAPE?</u> </p>
  <p> Under common law RAPE was  an <u>intentional act to have sexual intercourse</u> with a <u>female without consent</u> causing <u>actual penetration</u>, no matter how slight. At common law it was held to be legally impossible for a husband to rape a wife because consent to sexual intercourse was implied by marriage.  MODERNLY, the crime of rape has been broadly extended to include any non-consensual sexual act involving penetration, regardless of the relative sexes and marital relationship between the defendant and the victim.</p>
  <p> Here there was an <u>intentional act of sexual intercourse</u> because…And the victim <u>did not consent</u> to have sexual intercourse because …</p>
  <p> Therefore the defendant can be charged with rape.</p>
  <p>6)      <u>ARSON</u>? <strong>[Any explosion, smoke or flame raises the issue!!]</strong></p>
  <p> Under common law ARSON was  the <u>malicious burning</u> of the <u>dwelling of another</u>.  MODERNLY arson is extended by statute to the burning of other structures.  Malice for arson means that  the burning must be done with <u>wrongful intent</u>.</p>
  <p> Here there was a <u>burning</u> because…And there was a <u>malicious intent</u>  to burn because … Therefore the defendant can be charged with arson.</p>
  <p>7)      <u>LARCENY?</u> </p>
  <p> Under common law LARCENY was  the <u>trespassory taking</u> and <u>carrying away</u> of the <u>personal property</u> of <u>another</u> with <u>intent</u> to permanently deprive. Where the possession was gained by misrepresentation it was called LARCENY BY TRICK .  MODERNLY larceny is generally codified as “THEFT”.<strong> Important!</strong></p>
  <p><strong>[Only state the next paragraph if there is a theft from a master or employer.]</strong></p>
  <p> Theft of property from a master or employer by a manager or high-level employee was generally embezzlement and not a larceny, unless the defendant got possession by misrepresentation, a larceny by trick. But theft of the same property by a servant or low-level employee was generally larceny, not embezzlement, unless the defendant took possession from a third party before deciding to steal it, and in that case it was embezzlement.</p>
  <p><strong> [Only state the next paragraph if there is “lost” property at issue.]</strong></p>
  <p> Under the RELATION BACK DOCTRINE  some common law courts held that a theft of “lost” property by a person who initially intended to return it to the lawful owner was a larceny because a later decision to steal RELATED BACK to make the original taking unlawful. But other courts held this was embezzlement on the theory the original taking formed a “constructive trust.”</p>
  <p> Here there was a <u>trespassory taking</u> of the <u>personal property of another</u> because…And it was done with <u>intent to permanently deprive</u> because…</p>
  <p> Therefore…</p>
  <p>8)      <u>Can FALSE PRETENSES be charged?</u></p>
  <p> Under common law FALSE PRETENSES was  <u>a MISREPRESENTATION of FACTto obtain TITLE</u> to the property of another with <u>intent to permanently deprive</u>. MODERNLY false pretenses is generally codified as “THEFT”.<strong> Important!</strong></p>
  <p> Here there was <u>intentional misrepresentation of fact to obtain title</u> to property of another because…And there was an <u>intent to permanently deprive</u> because …</p>
  <p> Therefore…</p>
  <p>9)      <u>EMBEZZLEMENT?</u></p>
  <p> Under common law EMBEZZLEMENT was  the crime of <u>TRESPASSORY CONVERSION</u>  of the property of another by <u>one entrusted with lawful possession</u>with <u>intent to permanently deprive</u> or else causing <u>substantial risk of loss</u>. MODERNLY embezzlement is generally codified as “THEFT”.<strong> Important!</strong></p>
  <p><strong>[Only state the next paragraph if there is a theft from a master or employer.]</strong></p>
  <p> Theft of property from a master or employer by a manager or high-level employee was generally embezzlement and not a larceny, unless the defendant got possession by misrepresentation, a larceny by trick. But theft of the same property by a servant or low-level employee was generally larceny, not embezzlement, unless the defendant took possession from a third party before deciding to steal it, and in that case it was embezzlement.</p>
  <p><strong>[Only state the next paragraph if the stolen property was on a common carrier.]</strong></p>
  <p> Further, the COMMON CARRIER DOCTRINE held  that a common carrier such as a taxicab, bus or ship is entrusted with possession of passenger’s property, including lost property, so a theft of passenger property by an employee of a common carrier was more often held to be EMBEZZLEMENT than larceny, even if the property was “lost”.</p>
  <p><strong>[Only state the next paragraph if “lost” property was stolen.]</strong></p>
  <p> When “lost” property was stolen by a defendant who first intended to return it to the lawful owner, many courts found EMBEZZLEMENT on the theory the property was held in a “constructive trust”. But other courts applied the RELATION BACK DOCTRINE  and held it was a larceny because the decision to steal RELATED BACK to make the original taking unlawful.</p>
  <p> Here there was a <u>trespassory conversion</u> of the property of another with <u>intent to permanently deprive</u> or cause <u>substantial risk of loss</u> because …And the <u>defendant was entrusted with possession</u> (or would be deemed to have lawful possession) of the property because…</p>
  <p> Therefore the defendant could (not) be charged with embezzlement.</p>
  <p>10)  <u>Can the defendant be charged with ROBBERY?</u> </p>
  <p> Under CRIMINAL LAW a ROBBERY is  a <u>larceny</u>, defined above (or define larceny here if it was not defined earlier), <u>from a person</u> by use of <u>force or fear</u> to <u>overcome the will of the victim to resist</u>. <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p> Here there was a <u>larceny</u> <u>from the person</u> because…And the defendant used <u>force</u> ( or fear) to overcome the will of the victim to resist because…Therefore…</p>
  <p>11)  <u>BURGLARY?</u> </p>
  <p> Under COMMON LAW a BURGLARY was  the <u>breaking</u> and <u>entering</u> of the <u>dwelling of another</u> in the <u>night</u> with <u>intent</u> to commit a felony. The entry of a structure within the CURTILAGE  of the dwelling also constituted a burglary. <strong>Important! </strong>A physical breaking was generally required, but a CONSTRUCTIVE BREAKING would be found  if entry was the result of TRICK, VIOLENT THREATS, or CONSPIRACY.</p>
  <p> MODERNLY burglary has been extended by statute to all times of the day and all types of structures. Intent to commit a larceny is generally still sufficient to support a burglary charge, even if the larceny is no longer a felony. Further, the “breaking” element will generally be satisfied if there is a TRESPASSORY ENTRY, an entry without consent , express or implied.</p>
  <p> Here there was a <u>breaking</u> and <u>entry</u> (or <u>trespassory entry</u>) into a <u>structure of another</u> because…But it was not a dwelling because it was…And the <u>intent at the time of entry</u> was to commit a felony (or larceny) because…</p>
  <p> Therefore the defendant could not be charged with common law BURGLARY but could be charged modernly.</p>
  <p><strong>[More than any other crime you need to compare and contrast the common law burglary against the modern view and state whether the defendant could be charged under both or only modernly.]</strong></p>
  <p>12)  <u>RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY?</u> </p>
  <p> Under CRIMINAL LAW RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY is  the crime of <u>taking possession or control</u> over <u>stolen personal property</u> while <u>knowing it has been stolen</u> from the lawful possessor. Both the defendant that receives the stolen property and the defendant that provides (delivers) the property are liable.  </p>
  <p>Under the WHARTON RULE there can be no crime of CONSPIRACY TO RECEIVE STOLEN PROPERTY unless there are at least three defendants in agreement.</p>
  <p><strong>[Only state the following if the subject property was placed into the possession of the defendants with the tacit consent of the lawful owner or the police.]</strong></p>
  <p>The crime of receiving stolen property is a legal impossibility if the property was in the possession of the defendants with the CONSENT of the lawful OWNER or the POLICE as part of a “sting” operation. In that case the crime is ATTEMPTED RECEIPT OF STOLEN PROPERTY .</p>
  <p> Here…because…Therefore…</p>
  <p>13)  <u>ATTEMPTED (name the crime attempted)?</u> </p>
  <p> Under CRIMINAL LAW an ATTEMPTED CRIME is a <u>SUBSTANTIAL STEP</u> taken toward committing an <u>INTENDED CRIME</u>. <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p><strong>[Only state the following sentence if the facts suggest an issue of LEGAL IMPOSSIBILITY</strong> <strong>.]</strong></p>
  <p>For an attempted crime to be committed, it must be <u>legally possible</u> for the crime to have been completed <u>at the moment of the first substantial step</u>.</p>
  <p>Here there was a<u> substantial step</u> toward commission of the crime of (name the crime) because …And the defendant <u>intended to commit that crime</u> because…</p>
  <p> Therefore ATTEMPTED (crime) can be charged.</p>
  <p><strong>[There are particular rules for some “attempted” crimes:</strong> </p>
  <p>·        <strong>For any attempted crime to be committed <u>it must be legally possible</u> to commit the intended crime <u>at the instant of the first substantial step</u>.</strong></p>
  <p>·        <strong>There can be NO ATTEMPTED SOLICITATION</strong> <strong> because any “attempt” completes the crime.</strong></p>
  <p>·        <strong>At common law there was NO ATTEMPTED ASSAULT because assault by definition <u>is an attempt</u>.</strong></p>
  <p>·        <strong>And at common law there was NO ATTEMPTED BATTERY because that is the crime of <u>assault</u>.</strong></p>
  <p>·        <strong>There can be NO ATTEMPTED BURGLARY</strong> <strong> unless the defendants approach a structure with intent to enter and commit some other crime and <u>fail to enter at all.</u></strong></p>
  <p>·        <strong>EVERY BURGLARY OR ATTEMPTED BURGLARY</strong> <strong> makes the defendant automatically liable for a SECOND ATTEMPT CRIME because it is a substantial step toward commission the second crime the defendant intends to commit after breaking in.</strong></p>
  <p>·        <strong>There can be NO RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY and can only be a crime of ATTEMPTED RECEIPT if the subject property was conveyed to the receiving defendant with consent of the lawful owner (or the police).</strong></p>
  <p>·        <strong>The crime of ATTEMPTED MURDER requires INTENT TO KILL and no other form of malice for murder will suffice. So there can be NO ATTEMPTED DEPRAVED HEART MURDER and NO ATTEPTED FELONY MURDER.</strong></p>
  <p>·        <strong>There can be NO ATTEMPTED MANSLAUGHTER because the crime is an alternative to a murder charge that requires a completed homicide.]</strong> </p>
  <p>14)  <u>MURDER?</u> </p>
  <p> Under CRIMINAL LAW a MURDER is  an <u>unlawful</u> <u>HOMICIDE</u>, the killing of one human  being by another, with MALICE aforethought. MALICE for murder may be  1) an EXPRESS <u>intent to kill</u>, or IMPLIED by 2) intent to commit <u>GREAT BODILY INJURY</u>, 3) intent to commit an <u>INHERENTLY DANGEROUS FELONY</u>, the FELONY MURDER RULE, or 4) intentional creation of EXTREME RISKS to human life with <u>AWARENESS</u> of and <u>CONSCIOUS DISREGARD</u> for the risks, the DEPRAVED HEART MURDER rule. <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p> Under COMMON LAW there were NO DEGREES of murder but  MODERNLY first degree murder is generally codified as a 1) <u>willful, deliberate and premeditated</u> homicide or one 2) done by <u>enumerated means</u> <u>,</u>  or 3) caused by commission of an <u>enumerated felony</u> .  <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p> <strong>[Only state the following if it is not clear a “living human being” was killed.]</strong></p>
  <p> At common law and modernly, a “human being”  is a person who was born alive and was not yet dead. </p>
  <p><strong>[Only state the following if a death occurs long after the act being blamed.]</strong></p>
  <p> The common law held that there was NO HOMICIDE if the victim died more than a year and a day after the act blamed for the death. Modernly this has been broadly extended by statute. </p>
  <p> <strong>[State the following if the death results from suicide</strong> <strong>.]</strong></p>
  <p> A suicide  is not a homicide. But a death by suicide constitutes a homicide when it is actually and proximately caused by the acts of the defendant. </p>
  <p><strong>[State the following if more than one person was an actual cause of death.]</strong></p>
  <p> The prosecution must prove the defendant was the ACTUAL AND PROXIMATE CAUSE of death, and if more than one act was an actual cause of death, the last, unforeseeable, intentional act generally is the only  legal cause of death and it terminates the criminal liability flowing from all prior acts. Generally negligence by others is presumed to be foreseeable and criminal acts and intentional torts by third parties are presumed to be unforeseeable absent special knowledge.</p>
  <p> <strong>[Only state the following if a death occurs during or after the commission of an inherently dangerous felony (rape</strong> <strong>, robbery, burglary or arson).]</strong></p>
  <p><strong> </strong>Under the FELONY MURDER RULE, a homicide  caused by the commission of an inherently dangerous felony can be prosecuted as a murder if it is the result of acts done within the RES GESTAE of the underlying felony AND results from the INHERENT DANGERS of that type of felony. The RES GESTAE is  the sequence of events beginning with the first substantial step to commit the felony and ending when the defendants leave the scene of the crime and reach a place of relative safety.</p>
  <p><strong>[Only state the following if a death occurs after a break-in to a structure when the defendant’s sole purpose for breaking into the structure was to attack the victim.]</strong></p>
  <p>A murder prosecution cannot be based on the felony murder rule if the death occurred during a burglary that was committed solely for the purpose of attacking the victim because that is not one of the “inherent dangers” of burglary. </p>
  <p>Here there was an <u>unlawful HOMICIDE</u> because the victim was a human being and he was killed by the acts of another human being, the defendant. And there was <u>malice aforethought</u> because…  </p>
  <p>Therefore the defendant can (not) be charged with murder.</p>
  <p><strong>[Once you determine murder can be charged you should almost always discuss the degree of murder that is indicated by the facts as follows.]</strong></p>
  <p> Here the murder would (not) be in the FIRST DEGREE because…</p>
  <p>15)  <u>MITIGATING FACTORS?</u> (Always discuss if defendant kills while mentally impaired.)</p>
  <p> Under CRIMINAL LAW, MITIGATING FACTORS may be  weighed by the jury in determining whether or not a defendant killed with sufficient premeditation to support a finding of first-degree murder or whether the defendant acted with malice aforethought at all for a finding of murder. They may cause the jury to find only manslaughter and not murder.</p>
  <p> Here there were mitigating factors because the defendant was (intoxicated, mentally incapacitated, etc.)… Therefore the jury may find that… </p>
  <p>16)  <u>VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER?</u>(SKIP if the defendant clearly DID NOT intend to kill.)</p>
  <p> Under CRIMINAL LAW, VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER is  an <u>INTENTIONAL</u>, unlawful homicide, the killing of one human being by another, without malice aforethought because of ADEQUATE <u>PROVOCATION</u>. <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p> ADEQUATE PROVOCATION is provocation sufficient  to raise a reasonable person to a murderous rage, which did raise the defendant to such a rage, and which was the actual cause of the homicide.<strong> Important!</strong></p>
  <p> But ADEQUATE PROVOCATION CANNOT BE FOUND if the defendant had enough time before the killing that a reasonable person would have COOLED DOWN and no longer would have been in a murderous rage.</p>
  <p> Here there was a <u>homicide</u> because… And, <u>adequate provocation</u> might be found because…</p>
  <p> Therefore…</p>
  <p>17)  <u>INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER?</u> (SKIP if the defendant clearly DID intend to kill.)</p>
  <p> Under CRIMINAL LAW, INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER is  an <u>UNINTENDED</u> homicide, the killing of one human being by another, as a result of <u>CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE</u> (a.k.a. “negligent homicide”), <u>RECKLESSNESS</u> (a.k.a. “reckless homicide ”), or during the commission of a <u>MALUM IN SE crime</u>insufficient for a charge of murder (a.k.a. “misdemeanor manslaughter ”).<strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p> CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE is a <u>deliberate breach</u> of a <u>pre-existing duty</u> to protect others from extreme risks and RECKLESSNESS is a <u>deliberate creation</u> of extreme risks  to others.</p>
  <p> A MALUM IN SE crime is  one that involves moral turpitude.</p>
  <p> Here there was a <u>homicide</u> because the victim was a human being, and they were killed by the act of the defendant, another human being.</p>
  <p><strong>[The following applies if the death was caused by RECKLESSNESS (or CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE).]</strong></p>
  <p> And the defendant <u>deliberately created extreme risks</u> (or <u>deliberately breached a duty to protect others from extreme risks</u>) because…… But the defendant might not have been fully aware of the risks because…</p>
  <p> Therefore the defendant may be charged with involuntary manslaughter.</p>
  <p>18)  <u>REDLINE RULE?</u></p>
  <p> Under the REDLINE RULE a co-felon  in many States cannot be charged with murder under the FELONY MURDER RULE simply because a <u>co-felon was killed</u>by a <u>victim</u>, <u>bystander</u> or the <u>police</u> during the commission of a crime.</p>
  <p> Here the rule would apply because …</p>
  <p>19)  <u>KIDNAPPING?</u></p>
  <p> Under criminal law KIDNAPPING is  the crime of <u>unlawfully taking</u> or <u>confining people against their will</u>. At common law the victim had to be taken out of the country or across a state line. Modernly this requirement has been dropped.</p>
  <p> Kidnapping is not one of the “inherently dangerous felonies” for the Felony Murder Rule but modernly is often an “enumerated felony” for first-degree murder.</p>
  <p> Here…Therefore…</p>
  <p>20)  <u>MISPRISION?</u> (NEVER DISCUSS this unless the given facts make it entirely clear it is an intended issue  for discussion because this has not been a crime for about 200 years!)</p>
  <p> Under old common law MISPRISION was  the crime of <u>knowingly failing to reportfelonies by others</u> to the police. Modernly there is no general duty to report crimes by others, and the crime of misprision no longer exists generally.</p>
  <p> Here…Therefore…</p>
  <p>21)  <u>COMPOUNDING?</u> (This is a real crime so discuss this instead of misprision.)</p>
  <p> Under criminal law COMPOUNDING is  the crime of <u>taking money or something of value in exchange for a promise to not report crimes</u> committed by others.</p>
  <p> Here…Therefore…</p>
  <p>22)  <u>ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY?</u></p>
  <p> Under criminal law ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY is  <u>vicarious</u> criminal liability for criminal acts of co-criminals that <u>directly and naturally result</u> (foreseeable acts) from the defendant’s own criminal acts. Many Courts do not recognize Withdrawal as a defense to accomplice  liability.</p>
  <p> Here…Therefore…</p>
  <p>23)  <u>DEFENSE of INFANCY?</u> <strong>[Children and youthful defendants!]</strong></p>
  <p>Under the COMMON LAW there as a CONCLUSIVE PRESUMPTION that a child <u>under the age of seven</u> was unable to form CRIMINAL INTENT. There was a REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION that a child <u>between 7 and 14</u> could not form criminal intent, and that a child over the age of 14 could form criminal intent. Modernly similar rules have been adopted by statute.</p>
  <p> Here the defendant may claim he was <u>too young</u> to form criminal intent because…</p>
  <p> Therefore…</p>
  <p>24)  <u>DEFENSE of MISTAKE OF FACT?</u> <strong>[A frequently tested issue.] </strong></p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW a MISTAKE OF FACT is  a complete defense if it negates implied criminal intent. For GENERAL INTENT crimes only a REASONABLE mistake can negate criminal intent. For SPECIFIC INTENT crimes ANY MISTAKE OF FACT may negate criminal intent whether reasonable or not. Battery, rape, burglary, arson, involuntary manslaughter and murders that are not willful and deliberate or based on the felony murder rule are general intent  crimes. All other crimes are SPECIFIC INTENT crimes.</p>
  <p> A REASONABLE MISTAKE OF FACT is one that a <u>reasonable person would have made</u> in the same situation.  VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION  never makes an otherwise unreasonable mistake <u>reasonable</u>.</p>
  <p>A MISTAKE OF FACT is no defense to a charge of ATTEMPT if <u>criminal intent is proven</u> and the mistake merely prevented an otherwise <u>criminal act</u>. </p>
  <p>Here the defendant’s mistake of fact does (not) negate implied criminal intent because…</p>
  <p> Therefore…</p>
  <p>25)  <u>DEFENSE of LEGAL IMPOSSIBILITY?</u></p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW, LEGAL IMPOSSIBILITY  means that an attempted act is not an attempted crime, even if there was criminal intent, when the attempted crime is a <u>legal impossibility</u> at the <u>time</u> of the first <u>substantial step</u>.</p>
  <p>Here the crime charged was a legal impossibility because…  </p>
  <p>Therefore…</p>
  <p>26)  <u>DEFENSE of MISTAKE OF LAW?</u></p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW, A MISTAKE OF LAW about the legality  of an act does not alter the legality of the act. If the defendant commits a criminal act believing it is legal, it is still an illegal act. Likewise, if the defendant commits a legal act believing it is illegal, it is still a legal act.</p>
  <p>Here the defendant’s act was legal (illegal) at the time it was committed because…</p>
  <p>Therefore…</p>
  <p>27)  <u>DEFENSE of FACTUAL IMPOSSIBILITY?</u> </p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW, FACTUAL IMPOSSIBILITY is a defense that  the act actually done by the defendant was NOT A SUBSTANTIAL STEP  toward commission of any crime, despite criminal intent, because the act taken could never produce a criminal result.</p>
  <p>Here the defendant’s act was legal (illegal) at the time it was committed because…</p>
  <p>Therefore…</p>
  <p>28)  <u>DEFENSE of WITHDRAWAL</u>? <strong>[A commonly tested issue.]</strong></p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW, WITHDRAWAL is a defense that  defendants who were members of a CONSPIRACY (or perhaps are accomplices like those who have urged a crime to be committed) are not liable for crimes committed by co-criminals <u>AFTER</u> they have 1) given the co-criminals <u>NOTICE that they are abandoning</u> the criminal enterprise and 2) have TRIED TO STOP the co-criminals from continuing pursuit of the criminal goal.</p>
  <p>Here the defendants did (not) give NOTICE they were abandoning the criminal goal (e.g. conspiracy goal) because… And they did (not) TRY TO STOP the co-criminals from continuing because…Therefore.</p>
  <p>29)  <u>DEFENSE of INSANITY?</u></p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW insanity is a defense if it <u>negates criminal intent</u>. The insanity defense  is now prescribed by statute in almost all jurisdictions. Under the COMMON LAW M’NAUGHTEN RULE insanity was a defense if a <u>disease of the mind</u> at the <u>time of the act</u> prevented the defendant from <u>knowing</u> the nature and quality of his act, or <u>that they were wrong.</u> Under the IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE RULE insanity is  a defense if the defendant <u>knows it is wrong</u> but <u>cannot stop</u>herself.  <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p>  Here the defendant would argue that …Therefore…</p>
  <p>30)  <u>DEFENSE of CONSENT?</u></p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW consent is a defense to some crimes . [e.g. rape, larceny, battery – consent to a touching] The consent must be <u>informed</u>, <u>voluntary</u> and given by one with <u>legal capacity</u>. Further, consent is not a legal defense to an act that deliberately causes great bodily harm.</p>
  <p>Here… because…Therefore…</p>
  <p>31)  <u>DEFENSE of ENTRAPMENT?</u></p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW entrapment is a defense if  <u>criminal intent</u> was the <u>product of improper police behavior</u>.  Courts are split on the application of the entrapment defense, and under the majority view entrapment is no defense if the defendant was <u>predisposed</u> to commit the crime.  Under another minority view entrapment is a defense if <u>police conduct was outrageous</u> and <u>instigated</u> the crime, even though the defendant was predisposed. </p>
  <p>Here… because…Therefore…</p>
  <p>32)  <u>DEFENSE of DURESS?</u></p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW a defense may be raised to crimes, EXCEPT MURDER, that the criminal act was the <u>result</u> of DURESS . </p>
  <p>Here… because…Therefore…</p>
  <p><strong>MBE on Duress</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Frederick threatened Bruce with a physical beating unless Bruce personally wrote, signed and mailed a letter to the President of the United States threatening the President's life. Bruce compiled. A statute makes it a felony &quot;knowingly to mail to any person a letter that threatens the life of the President of the United States.&quot;<br>
      <br>
    Is Bruce guilty of violating that statute? &quot;<strong>No, because of the defense of duress.</strong>&quot;</li>
    <li></li>
  </ol>
  <p>33)  <u>DEFENSE of  NECESSITY?</u></p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW a defense of NECESSITY may be raised to certain crimes.</p>
  <p><strong>[This defense is really nothing more than self-defense, defense of others, or defense of property. And it is probably best addressed under one of those categories in a criminal law answer. The term defense of ‘necessity’ more often has tort connotations, especially when it is a ‘public’ necessity.]</strong></p>
  <p>34)  <u>PREVENTION OF CRIME (AUTHORITY OF LAW)?</u> </p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW a defendant is privileged to act with reasonable force to <u>PREVENT SERIOUS CRIMES</u>  being committed in their presence.  </p>
  <p><strong>[This is only a defense if a crime is about to be committed or already in progress and the defendant is preventing or stopping the crime in progress. It is no defense if the defendant acts AFTER THE CRIME IF OVER, except in the rare fact pattern when a fleeing felon (like a known serial-killer) is shot by police while fleeing because it is the only way to protect future victims from future crimes by the same felon.]</strong></p>
  <p>Here … because…Therefore…</p>
  <p>35)  <u>SELF-DEFENSE?</u> <strong>[A commonly tested issue.]</strong></p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW defendants who are NOT AGGRESSORS may act <u>reasonably</u> as <u>NECESSARY</u> to protect <u>their own safety</u>. Modernly defendants can “hold their ground” and have is no duty to retreat in most jurisdictions. Aggressors are people who  have unreasonably created or increased dangers to others. <strong>Important!</strong></p>
  <p>Here…because…Therefore…</p>
  <p>36)  <u>DEFENSE of OTHERS?</u> <strong>[A commonly tested issue.]</strong></p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW defendants are privileged to act <u>reasonably</u> as <u>necessary</u>to <u>defend others</u>  who are NOT AGGRESSORS from harm. Aggressors are people who  have unreasonably created or increased dangers to others. Courts are split when a defendant unknowingly acts to defend an AGGRESSOR. Under one view the defendant STEPS INTO THE SHOES  of the aggressor and has no privilege because the aggressor could not claim self-defense.  In other Courts the defendant is privileged to defend the aggressor in a fracas if they act with a <u>REASONABLE BELIEF</u> they  are acting to defend an innocent victim of aggression.</p>
  <p><strong>[It is generally NOT reasonable (and not privileged) to shoot fleeing criminals. The only time it is justified by “defense of others” is if the criminal poses a <u>clear danger</u> to the public safety and there is no other feasible way to stop the criminal from escaping. This is often tested.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>The use of <u>unreasonable</u> force in self-defense, defense of others or defense of property results in an “imperfect” defense claim. Where there is an “imperfect” defense claim, the jury may consider the motivations of the defendant as a MITIGATING FACTOR.]</strong></p>
  <p>Here … because…Therefore…</p>
  <p>37)  <u> DEFENSE of PROPERTY?</u> [A commonly tested issue.]</p>
  <p>Under CRIMINAL LAW a defendant is privileged to use reasonable force to protect his own property  or the property of others from harm. It is never reasonable to use deadly force to merely protect property.</p>
  <p><strong>[Note: This is never a defense for the use of deadly force. A defendant has no right to shoot thieves who are running away. But this “imperfect” defense will be a MITIGATING FACTOR for a jury to consider.]</strong></p>
  <p>Here … because…Therefore…</p>

  <p><strong>CRIMINAL LAW RULES AND DEFINITIONS:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong><strong>ACCOMPLICE (CRIMES): </strong></strong>An accomplice  is a person who urges the commission of a crime or knowingly helps others plan, execute, profit from or escape capture after a crime. At common law accomplices were classified as accessories before the fact, principals, and accessories after the fact. (see ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY.)</li>
    <li><strong>ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY (CRIMES): </strong>Accomplice  liability is a form of <u>vicarious</u>criminal liability for criminal acts of co-criminals that <u>directly and naturally result</u> (foreseeable acts) from the defendant’s own criminal acts. Many Courts do not recognize Withdrawal as a defense to accomplice liability. (see ACCOMPLICE, CONSPIRACY, CONSPIRACY LIABILITY, WITHDRAWAL.)</li>
    <li><strong>ACTUAL CAUSE (CRIMES): </strong>An act is an actual cause of injury if injury would not have occurred <u>but for</u> that act. Actual causation is referred to as "sine qua non." This is the same concept for crimes is the same as it is for torts.</li>
    <li><strong>AGGRESSOR (CRIMES):</strong> The initial aggressor in a fracas is the person who attacks a victim or otherwise starts a fracas. Once a fracas has begun the role of aggressor will switch to any party who unnecessarily escalates the level of violence or unreasonably continues the violence after the other party has attempted to withdraw and escape.</li>
    <li><strong>ARSON (CRIMES):</strong><strong> </strong>Arson is the common law felony of <u>maliciously burning</u> the <u>dwelling</u> of <u>another.</u> Modernly arson has been extended to the malicious burning of almost any structure. Malice for arson requires an act with a <u>wrongful intent</u> to cause a burning, but it is a GENERAL INTENT crime, meaning that MISTAKE OF FACT is not a defense unless it is a <u>reasonable</u> mistake.</li>
    <li><strong>ASSAULT (CRIMES): </strong>Assault is the crime of <u>intentionally acting</u> to <u>cause a battery</u> or <u>cause apprehension of a battery.</u> The victim does not have to be apprehensive. Assault is a SPECIFIC INTENT crime.</li>
    <li><strong>ATTEMPT (CRIMES): </strong>A criminal attempt is a <u>substantial step</u> taken with the <u>specific intent</u> of committing a <u>criminal act</u>. Attempt is a SPECIFIC INTENT crime, meaning that there can be no crime of ATTEMPT unless there was an act taken with the specific intent of committing some other specific crime. Therefore, there can be no "attempted attempt", "attempted second degree murder" or "attempted manslaughter." Further, ASSAULT is specifically defined as an "attempted battery" so there can be no "attempted battery" as a separate crime.</li>
    <li><strong>AUTHORITY OF LAW (CRIMES): </strong>Authority of law is a criminal law defense that otherwise criminal acts, such as battery and larceny, were authorized by law. </li>
    <li><strong>BATTERY (CRIMES): </strong>"I<u>ntentionally acting</u> for the purpose and with the result that there is a <u>harmful or offensive touching</u> of the victim." Battery is a GENERAL INTENT crime. (see GENERAL INTENT.)</li>
    <li><strong>BURGLARY (CRIMES): </strong>At common law burglary was the felony of <u>breaking</u> and <u>entering</u>the <u>dwelling</u> of <u>another</u> in the <u>night</u> with an <u>intent</u> to commit a <u>FELONY</u>. At common law a CONSTRUCTIVE BREAKING was found when entry was made by trick, threat of violence or through the help of a conspirator. The entry of a structure near a dwelling constituted a burglary if it was within the CURTILAGE  of the dwelling. Modernly burglary has generally been extended to any <u>trespassory entry</u> of almost any structure at any time of day or night with intent to commit a felony or larceny. A trespassory entry is any entry made <u>without consent, express or implied</u>. Courts are split as to whether there is a trespassory entry when the defendant has express or implied consent  to enter the structure for other purposes, and some State statutes classify any entry with intent to commit a felony or larceny as a burglary (see CONSTRUCTIVE BREAKING, CURTILAGE, LARCENY.)</li>
    <li><strong>CAUSATION (CRIMES): </strong>The GENERAL INTENT crimes require proof that the defendant 1) acted with criminal intent and 2) the act was the ACTUAL CAUSE and PROXIMATE (legal) CAUSE of a criminal result. [See ACTUAL CAUSE; PROXIMATE CAUSE.]</li>
    <li><strong>COMPOUNDING</strong><strong> (CRIMES):</strong> Compounding is the crime of taking money or something of value from criminals in exchange for agreeing to not report their crimes to the police.</li>
    <li><strong>CONSENT</strong><strong> (CRIMES): </strong>Consent is a defense to some crimes [rape, larceny, battery – consent to a touching] if there is <u>informed, voluntary</u> consent by a person with <u>legal capacity</u>. Consent is never a defense to murder, an act intended to cause serious bodily injury or crimes such as dueling. </li>
    <li><strong>CONSPIRACY</strong><strong> (CRIMES): </strong>A conspiracy is the crime of <u>agreement between two or more people</u> to work toward an <u>illegal goal.</u> Agreement may be <u>express</u> or <u>implied</u> by acts. Modernly an <u>overt act</u>  in furtherance of the conspiracy goal is often required. The WHARTON RULE (which see) requires more participants than are necessary to accomplish the illegal goal (no conspiracy for RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY, sale of illegal drugs, etc. unless three or more defendants participate.)  Conspiracy <u>does not merge</u>  with the illegal goal allowing conviction for conspiracy as a separate crime. (see ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY, MERGER, WITHDRAWAL.) </li>
    <li><strong>CONSPIRACY LIABILITY (CRIMES): </strong>Under the <em>Pinkerton Rule </em>each member of a conspiracy is vicariously liable for the criminal acts of co-conspirators <u>within the scope</u>(foreseeable and in furtherance) of the conspiracy agreement . Each member of the conspiracy may be charged with all crimes committed by other conspirators if they occur <u>after</u> they join the conspiracy, <u>before</u> the conspiracy ends, and before the defendant WITHDRAWS. A defendant that joins a conspiracy in progress is generally not liable for prior crimes committed by co-conspirators unless the defendant has sought to profit from those prior crimes. Most Courts recognize WITHDRAWAL as a defense against liability for crimes of co-conspirators after the withdrawal is effective, and some Courts recognize withdrawal as a defense to the charge of conspiracy itself. (see ACCOMPLICE, ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY, CONSPIRACY, WITHDRAWAL.)</li>
    <li><strong>CONSTRUCTIVE BREAKING (CRIMES): </strong>Under the common law a “breaking” for BURGLARY was deemed to have occurred if the defendants made entry by trick, threats of violence or the help of a co-conspirator. Modernly a sufficient “breaking” is deemed to have occurred if the defendants make a TRESPASSORY ENTRY to a structure. A trespassory entry is one without consent, express or implied. (see BURGLARY).</li>
    <li><strong>CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE (CRIMES):</strong> The <u>deliberate breach</u> of a pre-existing duty to act causing extreme risks to others. For example, a parent deliberately failing to feed an infant. “Deliberateness” of the breach distinguishes criminal negligence  (also called “gross” negligence) from “ordinary” negligence. (Compare to RECKLESS, RECKLESS HOMICIDE. INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER.) </li>
    <li><strong>CURTILAGE (CRIMES): </strong>The area around a dwelling sufficiently close to the dwelling that a breaking and entry might constitute a burglary under common law. (see BURGLARY.)</li>
    <li><strong>CRIME </strong> <strong>PREVENTION</strong><strong> DEFENSE (a.k.a. AUTHORITY OF LAW) </strong><strong>(CRIMES): </strong>A person is privileged to act as <u>reasonably necessary</u> to prevent a serious crime from being committed. This may also be called "authority of law".</li>
    <li><strong>DEFENSE</strong><strong><strong> </strong>of OTHERS (CRIMES, TORTS): </strong>A person is privileged to act as <u>reasonably necessary</u> to protect the safety of others. Jurisdictions are split when a defendant mistakenly acts to protect an <u>aggressor</u> in a fight. Under the STEPS-INTO-THE-SHOES view the defendant <u>steps into the shoes of the aggressor</u> and is not privileged to act to defend the aggressor in a fracas. Under the REASONABLE APPEARANCES view the defendant is privileged to act based on reasonable appearances, even if he acts to protect the aggressor in a fracas mistakenly believing he is aiding the victim of aggression. (See AGGRESSOR.)</li>
    <li><strong>DEFENSE of PROPERTY (CRIMES): </strong>A defense that a person has a right to act <u>reasonably</u> as <u>necessary</u> with <u>non-deadly force</u> to protect property. Never a defense to murder, but MISTAKE OF FACT may be a reasonable alternative. (see DEFENSE of MISTAKE OF FACT.)</li>
    <li><strong>DEPRAVED HEART MURDER (CRIMES): </strong>Depraved Heart Theory is a form of malice aforethought for murder where the defendant 1) <u>deliberately created extreme risks</u> to human life with 2) <u>awareness</u> of the risks and 3) a <u>conscious disregard</u> for the risks.</li>
    <li><strong>D</strong><strong>URESS </strong><strong>DEFENSE </strong><strong>(CRIMES): </strong>A claim of duress is a defense to any crime <u>except murder</u>if the criminal act was done without criminal intent as the <u>result</u> of duress.</li>
    <li>
      <p><strong> EMBEZZLEMENT (CRIMES): </strong>Embezzlement is the crime of <u>intentional trespassory conversion</u> of <u>personal property of another</u> by one <u>entrusted with lawful possession</u>. Modernly defined by statute as THEFT. (see ROBBERY, LARCENY, FALSE PRETENSES.)</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>ENTRAPMENT DEFENSE (CRIMES): </strong>Entrapment is a defense claim that the defendant's <u>criminal </u>intent was the <u>product of improper police </u>behavior. Jurisdictions are split. Under the MAJORITY VIEW entrapment is not a valid defense if the defendant was <u>predisposed</u> to commit the crime charged. Under a MINORITY view entrapment is a valid defense if <u>outrageous</u> police conduct <u>instigated</u> the crime.</li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>FACTUAL IMPOSSIBILITY (CRIMES):</strong> An act is not a “substantial step” sufficient to charge an attempted crime, regardless of criminal intent, if the act done could never result in a criminal result under any reasonable circumstance (e.g. it is not attempted murder  to stick pins in a voodoo doll even if the defendant sincerely believes it will work). (see MISTAKE OF FACT , LEGAL IMPOSSIBILITY  and MISTAKE OF LAW.)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>FALSE PRETENSES (CRIMES): </strong>False pretenses is the crime of <u>obtaining title</u> to the <u>property of another</u> with an <u>intent to permanently deprive</u> by means of <u>intentionally misrepresenting facts.</u> Modernly defined by statute as THEFT. (see ROBBERY, EMBEZZLEMENT, LARCENY.)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>FELONY (CRIMES): </strong>A felony is a crime for which the maximum possible penalty could exceed one year in prison. Under the common law the recognized felonies were murder, rape, manslaughter, robbery, sodomy, larceny, arson, mayhem and burglary <strong>[MR &amp; </strong><strong>MRS</strong> <strong>LAMB]</strong>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong> FELONY MURDER RULE (CRIMES): </strong>The Felony Murder Rule holds that the intent to commit an <u>inherently dangerous felony</u> is sufficient <u>malice aforethought</u> that any <u>unlawful homicide</u> that occurs <u>as a result</u> may be charged as a MURDER. Under the REDLINE RULE many states hold that the killing of a <u>criminal accomplice</u>  by any party other than another criminal accomplice is not chargeable as murder under the Felony Murder Rule. For the Felony Murder Rule to apply a death must result from acts done within the RES GESTAE of the inherently dangerous felony, the sequence of events beginning with the first substantial step toward commission and ending when the defendants have left the scene of the crime and reached a place of relative safety. (see MURDER, REDLINE RULE.)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong> GENERAL INTENT (CRIMES): </strong>Crimes are divided into two groups, GENERAL INTENT and SPECIFIC INTENT. General intent  crimes require the prosecution to prove the defendant 1) <u>intentionally committed a criminal act</u> that 2) <u>caused a criminal result</u>. There must be an intentional criminal act and a criminal result, but there is no requirement to prove that the defendant intended to cause the criminal result. VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION  is <u>never</u> a defense to a general intent crime, and for MISTAKE OF FACT to be a defense, it must be a <u>reasonable</u> mistake. The general intent crimes are BATTERY , RAPE, ARSON, INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER and MURDERS other than those based solely on intent to kill. All others are specific intent  crimes. (See VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION, MISTAKE OF FACT , SPECIFIC INTENT.)</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>GROSS (CRIMINAL) NEGLIGENCE (CRIMES):</strong> A deliberate act creating extreme risks to others but without complete awareness of the risks or conscious disregard for the risks</li>
    <li><strong>HOMICIDE (CRIMES): </strong>A homicide is the killing of one human being by another. Homicide is an element of the crimes of murder and manslaughter but is not a crime in and of itself. At both common law and modernly a "human being" is a person who has been born alive and has not yet died. About half the states have adopted "fetal murder" statutes. Those vary widely but generally make the killing of a fetus with malice aforethought a murder, but do not recognize the fetus as a "human being" for other purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>INFANCY DEFENSE (CRIMES): </strong>Under the common law there was a CONCLUSIVE PRESUMPTION that a child <u>under seven</u> years of age could not form criminal intent, a REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION that a child <u>between seven and fourteen</u> could not form criminal intent, and that a child <u>over fourteen</u> was able to form criminal intent.</li>
    <li><strong>IN</strong><strong>VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION</strong> <strong>DEFENSE </strong><strong>(CRIMES): </strong> Involuntary intoxication is a complete defense to all crimes if it caused the defendants to commit criminal acts.</li>
    <li><strong>INSANITY </strong><strong>DEFENSE </strong><strong>(CRIMES): </strong>Under the M'NAUGHTEN RULE insanity is a complete defense if a defendant suffered from a <u>disease of the mind</u> such that <u>at the time of the crime</u> he was unable to <u>know the nature and quality of his acts</u> (didn't know what he was doing) or else <u>that they were wrong</u> (didn't know he was doing a wrongful thing.)  Subsequently, under the IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE RULE the insanity defense  was extended to those that knew what they were doing, and that it was wrong, but <u>could not control themselves</u>.</li>
    <li><strong>INTENTIONAL ACT (CRIMES): </strong>A volitional act done <u>for the purpose</u> or <u>with knowledge</u> with reasonable certainty that <u>the result will occur</u>. For a GENERAL INTENT crime the prosecution must prove the defendant intended a <u>criminal act</u>, but does not have to prove that the <u>criminal result</u> was intended. For a SPECIFIC INTENT crime the prosecution must prove the defendant acted with an intent to produce the <u>criminal result</u>. (e.g. If defendant intentionally threw a bomb into a crowded theater, prosecution for a general intent crime -- battery, second degree murder, involuntary manslaughter -- only has to prove that the throwing of the bomb was <u>an intentional act</u>that the defendant knew with reasonable certainty would hurt someone. For the prosecution of a specific intent crime -- first degree murder, voluntary manslaughter -- the prosecution must show that the defendant <u>expressly intended to kill</u> someone.) (see GENERAL INTENT, SPECIFIC INTENT.)</li>
    <li><strong>INTENT TO KILL (CRIMES):</strong> Willful, deliberate acts to kill a human being. Only rwo crimes require the prosecution to prove intent to kill, ATTEMPTED MURDER and VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER. No other crimes require proof of intent to kill.</li>
    <li><strong>INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER (CRIMES):</strong> Involuntary manslaughter is an <u>unintentional homicide</u> caused by <u>criminal negligence</u><u> </u> (CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE), <u>recklessness</u>  (RECKLESS HOMICIDE) or the <u>commission of a malum in se crime</u>(MISDEMEANOR MANSLAUGHTER) insufficient to support a charge of murder under the FELONY MURDER RULE. Often this is said to be “without malice aforethought” but the crime does imply malice aforethought, but different from malice for murder. Involuntary manslaughter is a GENERAL INTENT crime. (See RECKLESS HOMICIDE, MISDEMEANOR MANSLAUGHTER, MURDER, HOMICIDE, FELONY MURDER RULE.) </li>
    <li><strong> </strong><strong>KIDNAPPING (CRIMES): </strong>Kidnapping is the crime of <u>unlawfully taking</u> or <u>confining people against their will</u>. At common law the victim had to be taken out of the country or across a state line. Modernly this requirement has been dropped. Kidnapping is not one of the “inherently dangerous felonies” for the Felony Murder Rule but modernly is often an “enumerated felony” for first degree murder. </li>
    <li><strong>LARCENY (CRIMES): </strong>The crime of <u>trespassory taking</u> and <u>carrying away</u> the <u>personal property</u> of <u>another</u> with an <u>intent to permanently deprive</u>. Where possession is gained by misrepresentation it is LARCENY BY TRICK. Modernly larceny is defined by statute under the label of THEFT. (see ROBBERY, EMBEZZLEMENT, FALSE PRETENSES.)  </li>
    <li><strong>LEGAL IMPOSSIBILITY DEFENSE (CRIMES):</strong> Legal impossibility is a defense argument that an act done by the defendant was <u>not a substantial step</u> toward commission of an attempted crime because it never could have produced the criminal result that is a required element of the intended crime under any circumstance (e.g. Bevis tried to murder Butthead by sticking pins in a voodoo doll.) This often involves an attempt to kill a person who is already dead or an attempt to steal property that has been abandoned.</li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>MALICE (CRIMES): </strong>Malice in criminal law is the requisite “mens rea” or “criminal intent” required to be found for a defendant to be guilty of a crime. Malice for <u>murder</u> may be shown by express <u>intent to kill</u>, intent to commit <u>great bodily injury</u>, intent to commit an <u>inherently dangerous felony</u> (see FELONY MURDER RULE) or intent to commit an act with an <u>awareness of and conscious disregard</u> for unreasonable risks to life (see DEPRAVED HEART MURDER.)  Malice for <u>arson</u> requires intent to <u>cause a burning</u> for any <u>unlawful or wrongful purpose.</u></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>MALUM IN SE CRIMES (CRIMES): </strong>Crimes that involve <u>immoral and wrongful behavior</u> rather than merely regulatory and procedural rules such as traffic laws (which are by contrast called malum prohibitum crimes). </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>MANSLAUGHTER (CRIMES):</strong> The crime of <u>unlawful </u>homicide either with intent to kill but without malice aforethought (VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER) or without intent to kill but with malice aforethought insufficient to find MURDER (INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER.) </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>MERGER (CRIMES):</strong> A defendant can be CHARGED with crimes and the LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES implied by that same crime. But the defendant cannot be CONVICTED of both a crime and the lesser included offenses implied by that same crime because the lesser included offenses MERGE into the conviction for the larger crime.</p>

      <p><strong>MISDEMEANOR MANSLAUGHTER (CRIMES): </strong>The crime of INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER <u>resulting from the commission of a crime</u> insufficient to support a charge of murder under the FELONY-MURDER RULE. Involuntary manslaughter is a GENERAL INTENT crime. (see FELONY-MURDER RULE, MURDER, INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER.) </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>MISPRISION (CRIMES): </strong>Under the common law MISPRISION was the crime of knowingly failing to report a crime committed by another person to the police. Modernly there is no generally duty to report crimes to the police and misprision no longer is recognized as a crime.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>MISTAKE OF </strong><strong>FACT</strong><strong></strong><strong> DEFENSE </strong><strong>(CRIMES):</strong> A mistake of fact is a defense argument that the defendant <u>did not have the criminal intent</u> necessary to be guilty of the crime charged. It is only a valid defense argument if it negates <u>implied</u> criminal intent, and is not a valid argument if criminal intent is <u>expressly</u> shown by the facts.. It is a defense to both GENERAL and SPECIFIC INTENT crimes. It is a valid defense if it negates the implied intent to either <u>commit the criminal act</u> charged (GENERAL INTENT crimes) or to <u>cause the criminal result</u>charged (SPECIFIC INTENT crimes). For a GENERAL INTENT crime the mistake must be <u>reasonable,</u> but for SPECIFIC INTENT crimes the mistake must only be actual. A reasonable mistake is one that a reasonable person would have made in the same situation.  <u>VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION</u> <u> never justifies</u> an otherwise unreasonable mistake. (see SPECIFIC INTENT, GENERAL INTENT, FACTUAL IMPOSSIBILITY, LEGAL IMPOSSIBILITY , MISTAKE OF LAW.)</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>MISTAKE OF LAW DEFENSE (CRIMES): </strong><u>A mistake about the legality of an intended act does not alter the legality of the attempted or committed act</u>. If the defendant intends an act believing it to be legal, and it is illegal at the time attempted or committed, it is still illegal despite his intent. If the defendant intends an act believing it to be illegal, and it is not illegal at the time attempted or committed, it is legal despite his belief. (e.g. If the defendant intends to murder the victim, but at the time of action the victim has already died from other causes, the act taken by defendant is not illegal.)</li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>MURDER (CRIMES): </strong>Murder is an <u>unlawful homicide</u>, the <u>killing</u> of one <u>human being</u> <u>by another,</u> with <u>malice</u> aforethought. Malice for murder may be 1) express <u>intent to kill</u>, or implied by 2) <u>intentionally causing great bodily injury</u>, 3) intentionally committing an <u>inherently dangerous felony</u>, the FELONY MURDER RULE, or 4) intentionally acting with an <u>awareness of and conscious disregard for unreasonable risks to human life</u>, the DEPRAVED HEART THEORY. At common law there were no degrees of murder but modernly statutes define first degree murder as those that are 1) <u>willful, deliberate and premeditated</u>, 2) by <u>enumerated means</u>, or 3) caused by the commission of <u>enumerated dangerous felonies.</u> All other murders are in the second degree. Murder is a SPECIFIC INTENT crime when it is based solely on intent to kill. Murder otherwise is a GENERAL INTENT crime. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>NEGLIGENT HOMICIDE (CRIMES): </strong>The crime of INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER caused by CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE, the deliberate breach of a duty to act to protect others from extreme risks . (see INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER, MURDER.)</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>PROXIMATE CAUSE (CRIMES):</strong> Proximate (legal) cause means that the criminal result required for a crime was the direct and natural result of the act the defendant did with criminal intent. But when independent acts by two or more people are all ACTUAL CAUSES of the criminal result, the <u>last, unforeseeable, intentional act</u> is generally held to be the only proximate (legal) cause of the result and proximate causation and criminal liability for all prior acts is terminated. And at common law an act was not deemed to be the cause of a <u>homicide</u> if the death occurred more than a year and a day after the act took place.</li>
    <li><strong>RAPE (CRIMES): </strong>The crime of <u>intentional sexual intercourse</u> with the slightest penetration <u>without consent</u>. Under the common law RAPE required the victim to be a <u>female</u> and <u>not the wife</u> of the defendant. Modernly RAPE is defined by statute. Rape is a GENERAL INTENT crime, meaning that VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION is <u>never</u> a defense and MISTAKE OF FACT is only a defense if it was <u>reasonable.</u> (see GENERAL INTENT, VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION, MISTAKE OF FACT.)</li>
    <li><strong>RECKLESSNESS (TORTS, CRIMES):</strong>Reckless acts are those done <u>deliberately</u> to create <u>extreme risks</u> to others. (See RECKLESS HOMICIDE, ACTUAL MALICE.)</li>
    <li>
      <p><strong> RECKLESS HOMICIDE (CRIMES):</strong> The crime of INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER, an unintended homicide caused by <u>deliberate</u> acts that created <u>extreme risks</u> to others, but insufficient to charge murder on depraved heart  theory, perhaps because of a <u>lack of awareness</u>or <u>lack of conscious disregard</u> of the risks to human life. “Deliberateness” in creating <u>extreme and obvious dangers</u> distinguishes recklessness  from risks created by “ordinary” negligence. For example, street racing is reckless behavior while the inadvertent running of a red light is not. (See INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER, CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE, MURDER.) </p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>REDLINE RULE (CRIMES): </strong>A defense to murder recognized in California and some other states that the killing of a <u>criminal accomplice</u> by any party <u>other than another criminal accomplice</u> during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony is a lawful act and NOT UNLAWFUL HOMICIDE so it cannot be used as a basis for charging the surviving accomplice with murder under the FELONY-MURDER RULE. (see MURDER, FELONY-MURDER RULE.)</li>
    <li><strong>RES GESTAE (CRIMES): </strong>The acts that give rise to a charge of murder based solely on the FELONY-MURDER RULE, beginning with the first substantial steps to commit an inherently dangerous felony and ending when the defendants reach a place of relative safety. (see FELONY-MURDER RULE.)</li>
    <li><strong>ROBBERY (CRIMES): </strong>The crime of <u>larceny</u>, the <u>trespassory taking and carrying away of personal property of another</u>, <u>from the person</u> by use of <u>force</u> or <u>fear</u>. (see LARCENY.)</li>
    <li><strong>SELF-DEFENSE (CRIMES): </strong>A person who is <u>not the aggressor</u> in a fracas is privileged to act as <u>reasonably necessary</u> to protect his or her own safety. This is NOT a defense if the party was the <u>aggressor</u> unless they are no longer the aggressor because they <u>attempted withdrawal</u>from the fracas or the other party <u>escalated the level of violence</u>. (see AGGRESSOR, NECESSITY.)</li>
    <li> <strong>SOLICITATION (CRIMES): </strong>A solicitation is the crime of <u>urging another person</u> to commit a <u>crime</u>. If the person urged commits the crime, the solicitation <u>merges</u> into the criminal result and cannot be convicted as a separate crime (see CONSPIRACY.)</li>
    <li><strong>SPECIFIC INTENT (CRIMES): </strong>Crimes are divided into two groups, GENERAL INTENT and SPECIFIC INTENT. Specific intent  means that the defendant must act with the intent of producing a SPECIFIC criminal result. VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION  and <u>any</u> MISTAKE OF FACT is a possible defense to a specific intent crime if it negates the intent to cause the specific criminal result. All crimes are specific intent except for BATTERY , RAPE, ARSON, INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER and MURDERS which do not involve allegations of intent to kill. All other crimes are specific intent crimes. (see GENERAL INTENT, MISTAKE OF FACT , VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.)</li>
    <li><strong>STATUTORY RAPE (CRIMES): </strong>Statutory rape is the statutory crime of having sexual intercourse with a minor below the statutory ‘age of consent’. It is a strict liability crime and a MISTAKE OF FACT , whether reasonable or unreasonable, is generally not a defense. (see MISTAKE OF FACT .)</li>
    <li><strong>UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENTS (TORTS/CRIMES):</strong> If a subsequent act by a third party, or natural event (“act of God”) is also an actual cause of the injury suffered by a plaintiff or victim, if will generally be viewed as an “unforeseeable intervening event” that terminates proximate cause and ends the liability of defendants that acted earlier. But negligence by a third party is presumed to be foreseeable and will not terminate proximate causation or liability. Criminal acts and intentional torts by third parties are presumed to be unforeseeable and will terminate all liability of defendants that acted earlier UNLESS the defendant knew the subsequent criminal act or intentional tort by the third party was likely to occur. (see PROXIMATE CAUSE.)</li>
    <li><strong>VICARIOUS LIABILITY (CRIMES): </strong>A defendant may be vicariously liable for the crimes of other defendants based on either ACCOMPLICE or CONSPIRACY theory.</li>
    <li><strong>VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION</strong><strong> DEFENSE</strong><strong> (CRIMES): </strong> Defendants may claim a lack of criminal intent if they were so intoxicated, through their own knowing acts, they were unable to form the SPECIFIC INTENT necessary for a specific intent  crime charged. But voluntary intoxication  is never a defense to a GENERAL INTENT crime (see SPECIFIC INTENT, GENERAL INTENT.)  </li>
    <li><strong>VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER (CRIMES):</strong> Voluntary manslaughter is an <u>intentional homicide without malice aforethought</u>. Generally that is because of <u>adequate provocation</u>sufficient to raise a reasonable person to a fit of rage which could and actually did cause the homicide. Intent to kill must be proven. Voluntary manslaughter is a SPECIFIC INTENT crime. (See MURDER, HOMICIDE.)</li>
    <li><strong>WITHDRAWAL</strong><strong> DEFENSE</strong><strong> (CRIMES): </strong>Members of CONSPIRACIES who WITHDRAW from the conspiracy by 1) giving <u>notice</u> that they will no longer help to further the conspiracy goal and 2) <u>acting to thwart</u> the remaining conspirators from attaining the conspiracy goal generally cannot be charged with subsequent crimes committed by other conspirators based on CONSPIRACY LIABILITY. Courts vary widely with regard to the requirements and extent of this defense. Some cases have allowed withdrawal to be a defense to both conspiracy liability and ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY. In some Courts the defense of withdrawal requires the defendant to report the conspiracy to the police. And some Courts view withdrawal as a defense to the crime of conspiracy itself rather than just a defense to subsequent crimes by co-conspirators. (see CONSPIRACY LIABILITY, ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY.)</li>
