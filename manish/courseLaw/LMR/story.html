<h1>This is my Story of First Year.</h1>
<hr>
<p>Daniel and Paul were involved in an automobile accident. Paul sued Daniel for $10,000 alleging that Daniel was negligent. Daniel’s liability depends on whether he had the green light at the time of the accident. Each party claims to have had the green light. Of the two other witnesses, one says that Paul had the green light. Before trial, Daniel offered Paul $5,000 to settle all claims arising from the accident. Paul accepted the offer.</p>
<p><strong>1. Question</strong> (Breach)<br>
  Assume that before payment of the $5,000 and before dismissal of the suit, Daniel repudiates his promise to pay Paul $5,000. Paul sues for $5,000. What result?<br>
  <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
Paul wins because the agreement was an enforceable compromise of a disputed claim.</p>
<p><strong>2. Question</strong> (Breach)<br>
Assume the same facts as in question above except that, instead of suing for $5,000, Paul prosecuted his $10,000 negligence action. Daniel defended on the ground that his liability, if any, has been replaced by his obligation on his $5,000 promise. What result on this defense?<br>
<strong>Answer:</strong><br>
Paul wins because, after Daniel repudiated his promise, Paul had the option to sue on that promise or on the original claim.</p>
<p><strong>3. Question</strong> (Breach)<br>
Assume that after Daniel promised to pay $5,000, Paul dismissed the negligence suit. Paul&rsquo;s witness then admits to Daniel that he lied, and that the traffic light was green in Daniells favor. Paul did not know that the witness had lied- Daniel refused to pay Paul and Paul sued Daniel for $5,000. What result?<br>
<strong>Answer:</strong><br>
Paul wins because he did not know the witness was lying when he accepted Daniel&rsquo;s offer.</p>
<p><strong>4. Question</strong> (Breach)<br>
  Assume that after Daniel promised to pay the $5,000, Paul dismissed the negligence suit- Daniel was unable to pay the $5 ,000 and Paul threatened to sue Daniel. Upon learning these facts, Ted told Paul: &ldquo;Daniel is an old friend of mine. If you will not sue him, I will pay you $5,000.&rdquo; Paul said: &ldquo;Okay," and did not file suit against Daniel. A week later, Ted repudiated his promise to Paul. Paul sued Ted for $5,000. What result?  <br>
  <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
Paul wins because his agreement to forebear suing Daniel is sufficient consideration for Ted's promise.  </p>
<p><strong>5. Question</strong> (Statute of Frauds)<br>
  Assume the same facts as in above, except that Ted defended on the ground of the Statute of Frauds. What result on this defense?  <br>
  <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
Paul wins because Ted's promise was not one required to be evidenced by a writing signed by Ted.  </p>
