<h1>Defamation</h1>
<p>Under tort law <strong>DEFAMATION</strong> is a <strong>FALSE</strong> statement of material fact <strong>PUBLISHED</strong> to others about the plaintiff <strong>CAUSING DAMAGE</strong> to <strong>REPUTATION</strong>. Defamation may be <strong>SLANDER</strong>, an <strong>oral</strong> statement, or <strong>LIBEL</strong>, a <strong>written</strong> statement. </p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>It is usually a mistake to discuss both defamation and false light concerning the same statement because if it is a statement that would damage one&rsquo;s reputation the issue is clearly defamation, not false light. If the statement does not damage the plaintiff&rsquo;s reputation but only causes embarrassment otherwise, it is not defamation and can only be false light.</p>
<p>But many false statements are <strong>PRIVILEGED</strong> where the defendant speaks to defend a private interest, group interest or the public interest and does so without malice and in a reasonable manner calculated to defend that interest without unnecessarily harming the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Injury to reputation will be presumed where there is LIBEL or SLANDER PER SE. SLANDER PER SE is found where the false statement alleges CRIMINAL behavior, LOATHSOME disease, UNCHASTE behavior or improper BUSINESS practices.</p>
<p>Under NEW YORK TIMES and its progeny, a PUBLIC FIGURE PLAINTIFF must prove ACTUAL MALICE, that the false statement was made with knowledge or reckless disregard of its falseness, in order to recover in a defamation action. A PUBLIC FIGURE is a person who has acted to put themselves in the public spotlight. Further, where a matter of PUBLIC CONCERN is at issue, or where the plaintiff seeks punitive damages, the plaintiff must at least prove NEGLIGENCE.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>More Explanation about per se and per quod:</strong><br />
Certain types of defamatory statements were damaging to reputation. Those are called defamation per se. If a statement is defamation per se, the Court may award a money judgment to plaintiffs without requiring any further evidence they suffered injury.</p>
<p>Other defamatory statements that were are not so clearly damaging to reputation were called defamation per quod. If a statement was defamation per quod, the Court could not award a money judgment to the plaintiffs unless they presented convincing evidence they suffered monetary losses as a result of the statements.</p>
<p>Whether statements are defamation per se or defamation pre quod depends on three factors:<br />
    1. Whether statements are insinuations that have to be interpreted by the listener or clearly defamatory statements about the plaintiff;<br />
    2. Whether the statements are written or oral; and<br />
    3. The subject matter of the statements.</p>
<p>Insinuations<br />
    Under the common law insinuations that might harm the reputation of the plaintiff were always defamation per quod whether they are oral or written, and no matter what the subject matter might be.<br />
    Three types of &ldquo;insinuations&rdquo; were recognized by the common law: innuendo, colloquium, and inducement. </p>
<p>The important point is that if defendants do not clearly identify the plaintiffs as the subject of their statements, or the statements do not clearly make factual assertions about the plaintiffs that would damage their reputations, they are &ldquo;insinuations&rdquo; and defamations per quod in all cases.</p>
<p>If defendants make statements that clearly identify the plaintiff and allege facts that would injure the plaintiff&rsquo;s reputation, they are clearly defamatory. But whether they were defamation per se or defamation per quod depended on whether the statements are libel or slander.</p>
<p>A. Libel:<br />
    A defamatory statement is libel if it is written or recorded in a manner that gives its damaging effects longevity. Under the common law a written defamatory statement about the plaintiff was libel and libel was always defamation per se, regardless of the subject matter.</p>
<p>B. Slander<br />
    A defamatory statement is slander if it is oral or transitory in nature so that the damaging effect soon dissipates. Under common law an oral defamatory statement about the plaintiff was slander but it was only defamation per se if it accused the plaintiff of one of the following four things:<br />
    &bull; Having committed a serious crime; <br />
    &bull; Having a loathsome disease; <br />
    &bull; Engaging in sexual misconduct. (Unchaste Behavior) OR <br />
    &bull; Engaging in business or professional misconduct; </p>
<p>Remember: <strong>CLUB</strong></p>
<p>Any slander regarding any other subject matter was always defamation per quod.</p>
<p>If plaintiffs prove the elements of defamation per se the Court can award money judgments without any proof the plaintiffs suffered monetary losses. These are general damages. If the plaintiff also proves the statements caused monetary losses those are special damages and they can be awarded in addition. This is often phrased, &ldquo;The plaintiff can get generals without proving specials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If plaintiffs only prove the elements of defamation per quod the Court cannot award any damages at all until unless the plaintiffs prove the defamations caused monetary losses. Those are special damages. If plaintiffs do prove special damages, the Court can award general damages in addition to the special damages. But if plaintiffs fail to prove defamations per quod caused monetary losses the plaintiffs get nothing. This is often phrased, &ldquo;The plaintiff must prove specials to get generals&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Essay</strong></p>
<p>Barbara, the famous TV news lady, was assigned to do a story on former governor, Pat Wilson, to find out why Wilson had become almost a recluse in the years since he left office.</p>
<p>Barbara interviewed Wilson at his home. Wilson's speech was slurred, his eyes were bloodshot and he was unsteady. Barbara asked him about his health, and he declined to comment. Barbara knew Wilson had once been an alcoholic, and she suspected he had begun drinking heavily again. But she did not ask him about this because she knew he would deny it.</p>
<p>On TV Barbara accurately described Wilson's slurred speech, bloodshot eyes and unsteady gait. Then she stated, &quot;It appears that someone we once knew and respected has gone back to his old ways.&quot; She did not state who the &quot;someone&quot; was, and she did not explain what she meant by &quot;his old ways.&quot;</p>
<p>Because of the news broadcast, rumors rapidly spread that Wilson had again developed a drinking habit. Wilson's approval in polls fell dramatically, and he was passed over for the post of State Republican Chair, but he had little chance of being selected for that post.</p>
<p>Wilson demanded a retraction and apology, but Barbara refuses. Discuss potential action by Wilson.</p>
<p>[<strong>ANSWER EXPLANATION</strong>: This question requires discussion of defamation actions by public figures. It is an example of defamation using innuendo (When you refer to something indirectly, you point at it without mentioning it, making an innuendo), interpretation (<strong>COLLOQUIUM</strong>) or knowledge of extrinsic facts (<strong>INDUCEMENT</strong>).<br />
    A definition and discussion of actual malice is necessary. Actual malice may be based on recklessness. When it comes to recklessness, this question is a wobbler because Barbara clearly could have asked and then reported &quot;Wilson denies a drinking problem.&quot;<br />
    If Wilson was not a public figure, he would only have to prove the falsity of Barbara&rsquo;s statements and that they were of the sort that would damage his reputation. Barbara might then claim she was PRIVILEGED to make the statements, even if they were false. But she would have to prove she acted in a &lsquo;reasonable manner&rsquo; without malice to protect the public interest. But she would not be able to prove that because it is not clear what &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; she is protecting, and it would not be reasonable to make damning statements of this type on TV about a private individual without at least questioning the person about it first directly.<br />
    PRIVILEGE is frequently tested and poorly taught so be sure to consider it in any defamation question. Did the defendant have a legitimate reason to speak out, and did they do it in a reasonable manner? The 1st Amendment does not protect defamatory statements, but it does protect the right to speak out to protect legitimate interests, as long as the defendant acts reasonably and without malice. Privilege defines the balance between these two conflicting rules of law.]</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p><strong>WILSON v. BARBARA </strong></p>
<p><strong>1) DEFAMATION?</strong></p>
<p>Under the law of torts <strong>DEFAMATION</strong> is a <strong>false statement</strong> of material fact of or <strong>about the plaintiff</strong> published to another party <strong>causing damage</strong> to the plaintiff's <strong>reputation</strong>. If the statement involves <strong>innuendo</strong>, <strong>interpretation</strong>, or <strong>knowledge of extrinsic facts</strong> it is <strong>DEFAMATION PER QUOD</strong>. Oral defamation is <strong>SLANDER</strong> and written or recorded defamation is <strong>LIBEL</strong>.</p>
<p>A false statement may be PRIVILEGED if the defendant speaks to defend a private interest, group interest or the public interest and does so without malice and in a reasonable manner calculated to defend that interest without unnecessarily harming the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Therefore, if Wilson can establish a prima facie case, and that Barbara was not privileged, Barbara can be liable for defamation.</p>
<p><strong>2) Were there FALSE STATEMENTS OF FACT?</strong></p>
<p>To establish a prima facie case, Wilson must show Barbara's objectionable comments were false. Her comments about his physical appearance, the slurred speech and bloodshot eyes, would be true and not defamatory because they do not, by themselves, cause loss of reputation.</p>
<p>Wilson's denial that he had been drinking might not be credible enough to prove the point. He may have difficulty proving factually that he had not been drinking.</p>
<p>Therefore, Wilson may not be able to prove the remarks were false.</p>
<p><strong>3) Were the STATEMENTS ABOUT THE PLAINTIFF?</strong></p>
<p>Here Barbara might say her remarks were not clearly about Wilson because she only said &quot;someone&quot; had done something. But the context within which the remarks were made, comments on an interview with Wilson and his physical appearance, made it clear Barbara's statements were about Wilson.</p>
<p>The statement involved innuendo and required extrinsic facts and interpretation because it referred to &quot;his old ways.&quot; Therefore Barbara would argue this was a defamation PER QUOD, if at all. But Wilson would argue that since the remarks were made along with observations about &quot;slurred speech&quot; and &quot;bloodshot eyes&quot; viewers would interpret this as a reference to prior drinking problems even if they had no prior knowledge of extrinsic facts. Wilson would argue this was defamation PER SE.</p>
<p>Therefore, the remarks would reasonably be interpreted to be about Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>4) Did Barbara PUBLISH her remarks?</strong></p>
<p>Here Barbara clearly published her remarks because they were made &quot;on TV.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>5) Were the statements DAMAGING TO REPUTATION?</strong></p>
<p>A statement that Wilson had become an alcoholic would be damaging to reputation because alcoholism is generally seen as a character flaw and undesirable in a person placed in a position of responsibility.</p>
<p>Therefore, the remarks were damaging to reputation.</p>
<p><strong>6) Did Wilson SUFFER DAMAGE?</strong></p>
<p>Under the law of torts DEFAMATION PER QUOD requires proof of SPECIAL DAMAGES before GENERAL DAMAGES will be presumed. Special damages will be presumed in a slander per se concerning criminal acts, a loathsome disease, unchaste behavior or improper business practices.</p>
<p>Here Wilson might argue that the claim he was alcoholic is equivalent to accusation of a loathsome disease. Barbara would dispute this, but alcoholism often is seen as a disease that might cause others to avoid the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Barbara would argue that her statements were not defamatory on their face (not per se) because they involved innuendo and required interpretation. Wilson would dispute this.<br />
    Wilson would argue he had suffered SPECIAL DAMAGES because his &quot;popularity fell&quot; and he did not get a position he wanted. Barbara would argue that this did not damage Wilson because he was a &quot;former&quot; politician and &quot;almost a recluse.&quot; Further, she would argue that Wilson &quot;had little chance&quot; of getting the post, so her broadcast did not cause his loss.</p>
<p>Therefore, damages may be presumed, or Wilson may be able to prove damages.</p>
<p><strong>7) Is Wilson a PUBLIC FIGURE PLAINTIFF?</strong></p>
<p>Under New York Times v. Sullivan a plaintiff that is a public figure must prove actual malice, statements made with knowledge or reckless disregard for their falsity. A public figure is one who injects themselves into the public arena.</p>
<p>Here Wilson had been inactive in the public arena because he was &quot;almost a recluse&quot; and only a &quot;former governor.&quot; Barbara would argue that Wilson agreed to be &quot;interviewed at his home&quot; for a &quot;TV&quot; show, and hoped to become the &quot;State Republican Chair.&quot;</p>
<p>Therefore, Wilson had been in the public eye, was placing himself in the public arena by willingly being interviewed, and was a public figure.</p>
<p><strong>8) Can Wilson prove ACTUAL MALICE?</strong></p>
<p>Actual malice means statements made with knowledge of or reckless disregard for their falsity. Reckless disregard means<strong> intentionally acting without awareness</strong> and with <strong>negligent disregard</strong> for the <strong>clear and serious risk</strong> to others.</p>
<p>Here Barbara did not act with knowledge her statement was false because she &quot;suspected&quot; it was true. But there was a clear risk of injury to Wilson because she made comments &quot;on TV&quot; that would damage him.</p>
<p>Wilson would argue she acted with a <strong>reckless disregard</strong> of whether her comments were true or not because she had an opportunity to ask Wilson and &quot;did not ask.&quot;<br />
    Barbara would argue it was not reckless disregard because Wilson would only have denied drinking. She would show that no further effort on her part would have clarified the matter any further.</p>
<p>Therefore, Barbara probably would be held to have not acted with actual malice.</p>

<p><strong>June 2012</strong></p>
<p>Superstore is a 24-hour grocery store. For safety reasons, Superstore has installed bright lights in its parking lot that turn on in response to loud noises. The lights turn on several times a week, especially during the night, and have caused neighboring homeowners to complain of loss of sleep and various adverse health consequences.</p>
<p>One night, Ned and Carl exited Superstore, each carrying a heavy bag. Ned is the publisher of a local newspaper and Carl is a business consultant. As they exited, they accidentally bumped into each other, each causing the other to drop his bag and spill its contents. A loud argument ensued. Ned took several steps toward Carl; Carl threw an orange at Ned and grazed his pant leg without injuring him; and Ned punched Carl in the stomach. The loudness of the argument caused the lights in the parking lot to turn on. Soon, a Superstore security guard arrived and restored order.</p>
<p>The next day, Ned published an account of the incident, calling Carl a &ldquo;coward and a liar.&rdquo; Carl experienced a substantial decrease in business consulting thereafter.</p>
<p>1. What tort claim or claims can Ned reasonably bring against Carl, and what defense or defenses can Carl reasonably raise? Discuss.<br />
    2. What tort claim or claims can Carl reasonably bring against Ned, and what defense or defenses can Ned reasonably raise? Discuss.<br />
    3. What tort claim or claims can the neighboring homeowners reasonably bring against Superstore? Discuss. </p>
<p><strong>Solution A</strong></p>
<p><strong>DEFAMATION</strong></p>
<p>DEFAMATION is the publication to a third party of information &quot;of and concerning the plaintiff&quot; that is false and harms the plaintiff's reputation. LIBEL is publishing the defamatory information in a manner that is fairly permanent, e.g., in a newspaper. Normally, special damages do not need to be proved for any form of LIBEL, but they are certainly presumed for LIBEL PER SE. LIBEL PER SE is libelous publication of defamatory information that alleges:</p>
<p>i) Unchastely<br />
    ii) Commission of a crime of moral turpitude<br />
    iii) A person is incompetent in his business or profession OR<br />
    iv) A loathsome disease (traditionally leprosy or a venereal disease)</p>
<p>Here, Ned &quot;published an account of [the altercation between him and Carl]&quot; and in the newspaper publication called Carl a &quot;coward and a liar.&quot; This information was &quot;of and concerning&quot; Carl, and it was published to third parties (the newspaper's readers). Ned had nothing on which to base the allegation that Carl was a liar, and thus the information was false. Since Carl &quot;experienced a substantial decrease in business consulting thereafter,&quot; it is arguable that the decrease was a result of the allegation. The publication clearly harmed Carl's reputation. Since being a &quot;coward and a liar&quot; clearly implies that a person is not competent as a business consultant, Ned's publication constitutes LIBEL PER SE and Carl does not need to prove special damages. Since Carl was not a public personality and this occurrence was not of public concern, there are no constitutional elements to be dealt with.</p>
<p><strong>DEFENSES TO DEFAMATION</strong><br />
    Ned will argue that he had the limited privileges of publishing an opinion, and of publishing a report of a public incident. However, Ned surpassed and thus made ineffective these privileges by showing malice, a reckless indifference to the truth or falsity of the allegations. NED'S DEFENSES TO DEFAMATION WILL FAIL.</p>
<p><strong>Solution B</strong></p>
<p><strong>Defamation</strong></p>
<p>Defamation requires a defamatory statement by D, of or concerning P, published to a third party who understands it to refer to P, and damage to the reputation. A defamatory remark is one that causes a person to be shunned, hated, loathed or avoided or causes injury to a person reputation.</p>
<p><strong>Slander/Libel</strong></p>
<p>A statement is slander if it is spoken and libel if it is printed. A statement is libel on its face or slander per se if it imputes a loathsome disease, a want of chastity, a crime of moral turpitude or is injurious to one's occupation. If the person defamed is a public figure and the matter is of public concern they must prove falsity and fault. If person is private figure and the matter is of private concern the P must prove fault and mere negligence.</p>
<p>Here Carl will bring an action against Ned for defamation. Carl will argue that the statement that he was a liar and a coward was defamatory and damaged his reputation. He will further argue that when he published it in the newspaper that he worked for, it was publicated to a third party and that he used his name and described the incident would cause others to understand that it was referred to him. Carl will argue that his business and reputation was damaged in this publication. Carl will argue that this statement is libel because it was printed and in a permanent form and widely read. He will further assert that this statement was libel on its face because Ned said he was a coward and a liar. Carl will argue that as a business consultant his customers expect honesty and to publicly call him a liar is deliberately injurious to his occupation. The courts may not determine that this is an &quot;on its face&quot; statement because Ned did not specifically state that he could not perform his occupation or was inept directly, therefore Carl will have to prove special damages and will not get presumed damages for a statement being libel on its face.</p>
<p><strong>Fault</strong></p>
<p>Fault requires proving malice. Malice is knowledge of falsity or entertaining serious doubts as to the truthfulness before publishing something.<br />
    Here Carl will argue that Ned was acting with malice as he was maliciously and recklessly printing the incident and calling him injurious names after the altercation. Carl will assert that he was negligent in printing the statement as he had a duty as a professional newsman to accurately report the news and not incidents that he embellished out of spite. Carl will prevail in this argument.</p>
<p><strong>Damages</strong></p>
<p>Carl will show that he was injured in his occupation as a result of Ned's negligent publication. He will show that his business has substantially declined as a result of the remarks made by Ned. Carl will be entitled to general damages that he can show as a result and possibly punitive damages as the statements were made negligently and maliciously. </p>

<p><strong>June 2015</strong></p>
<p>Abe was the head coach of the fifth-grade girls&rsquo; basketball team at Elementary School. Bob, the assistant coach, blamed Abe for the team&rsquo;s poor performance. Seeking to have Abe fired, Bob accused Abe after a game of stealing money from the team fund. Bob made the accusation while standing in a crowd of students and parents. Bob knew the accusation to be untrue.</p>
<p>In retaliation, Abe threw a basketball at Bob, who ducked to avoid being hit. The basketball missed Bob but struck Carl, a parent, in the face. Abe then went up to Bob and told him, &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better watch your back,&rdquo; which subsequently caused Bob to have nightmares.</p>
<p>Abe was thereafter fired from his position as head coach, based on Bob&rsquo;s accusation that Abe had stolen money from the team, and he was unable to obtain a job in his chosen profession.</p>
<p>1. Under what theories, if any, and against whom, might Abe sue for damages? Discuss.<br />
    2. Under what theories, if any, and against whom, might Bob sue for damages? Discuss.<br />
    3. Under what theories, if any, and against whom, might Carl sue for damages? Discuss.</p>
<p><strong>Solution A</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abe v Bob Defamation</strong><br />
    <br />
A defamatory statement made by D concerning of P published to a third party that causes damages to P's reputation. Here Abe was the coach of the basketball team and was being blamed for the team&rsquo;s bad performance. Bob made an accusation in front of the crowd of students and parents. Bob knew the accusation to be false. This would constitute a defamatory statement because it was known to be false.</p>
<p><strong>Concerning of P</strong></p>
<p>Here the statements were about Abe because he was mentioned directly. </p>
<p><strong>Published to a third party</strong></p>
<p>Here Bob made the statements in front of the students and parents who presumably understood.</p>
<p><strong>Damages to P's reputation</strong></p>
<p>Here being accused of stealing money would damage one's reputation because it implies that you are a dishonest person and reflects on your character as a person and morals. The facts indicate that due to the defamation Abe was fired and was not able to obtain a job in his profession.</p>
<p><strong>Slander per se</strong></p>
<p>Slander is spoken defamation. It is per se if it falls within the following categories: business, crime involving moral turpitude, chastity of a woman and loathsome disease. Here the statements were regarding theft and dishonesty. This would constitute moral turpitude crime because it tarnishes the P's reputation as an honorable and honest person and alludes that P is a criminal who stole money from the team fund.</p>
<p>Additionally it also falls within the business and profession category because as a head coach he was held in a trust position to dispose of the team funds and entrust in training the girls. This accusation would reflect badly on his ability to do his job and on his trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Therefore the defamation is slander per se and if there are no damages they would be presumed.</p>
<p><strong>Constitutional Issues</strong></p>
<p>If the P is a public figure you need to prove actual malice which is falsity and fault as to the defamation. If it is a private person you only need to establish a prima facie case.<br />
    A public person is one who gains notoriety or thrust himself into the public eye.</p>
<p>Here Abe seems to be public person amongst his peers because he is the head coach and is known by the students and teachers. Usually all the students and parents know the sport coaches. Not only was he known by his peers from the school he coached since he was the head coach but was also known by other schools that compete against the coach's team. Among the sports community the coaches know of other school coaches thus other schools would know of Abe and his work as a coach, whether he is a good coach and has won games or a bad one and lost championships.</p>
<p>Therefore in this regard Abe will be considered a public person.</p>
<p><strong>Falsity and Fault</strong></p>
<p>There needs to be intentional or reckless disregard for its truth or falsity. If the matter is private then there needs to be at least negligence.<br />
    The facts state that Bob knew the statements to be false nevertheless Bob intentionally made the statements in front of everyone with the purpose to damage Abe's reputation.<br />
    Therefore there is malice and Abe would be entitled to recover actual damages and may recover punitive damages.</p>
<p><strong>Damages</strong></p>
<p>Here the facts state that Abe lost his job due to the defamation and was not able to get other jobs because his reputation was tarnished.<br />
    Therefore Abe will be entitled to recover damages.</p>
<p><strong>Defenses Qualified Privilege</strong></p>
<p>Bob will raise that his statements were privileged because they were for the public interest. Because it was in the interest of the school and the parents to know the type of coach Abe was.</p>
<p>However this defense will not hold because the statements were made intentionally with malice since he knew the statements were not true.</p>
<p><strong>Solution B:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abe v. Bob</strong><br />
    <br />
    <strong>Defamation:</strong> when a defendant makes a false statement about another that he knows to be false or is negligent as to its truth or falsity, and it is communicated to a third party, he is liable to that person for all harm caused thereby.</p>
<p><strong>False Statement:</strong> a statement that is untrue about the plaintiff.</p>
<p>In the current case, the facts tell us that Bob made statement about Abe stealing from the team fund that he knew to be false. Therefore this element is met.</p>
<p><strong>Communicated to a third party: </strong>This is either accomplished by libel (printed matter) or slander (verbally communicated) where the defendant says it directly to a third party or in manner which they are reasonably certain the third person will hear or read it.</p>
<p>In the current case, Bob made the false statement while standing in a crowd of students and parents. Bob was reasonably certain that this false statement would be heard by third parties. Therefore the element of communication is met.</p>
<p><strong>Plaintiff is harmed thereby:</strong> In the current case the facts tell us that Abe was fired as a result of the false statement made by Bob and was not able to find another job. Clearly Abe was harmed thereby.</p>
<p><strong>Slander per se: </strong>When the false statement made was such that would shock the conscience and hold the subject of the statement up to ridicule, scorn, hate and contempt, especially one that impacts one&rsquo;s work and job, this can be slander per se.<br />
    In the current case, the type of slander made by Bob was one that accused him of being a thief, something that would shock the conscience of a regular person. It clearly caused Abe to be scorned and hated as he was fired as a result of it and could not find another job in his chosen profession. </p>
<p>Therefore Bob would clearly be liable to Abe for Defamation.</p>
<p><strong>Defenses: </strong>There do not appear to be any good defenses for Bob to use.  </p>

<p><strong>June 2016</strong></p>
<p>Cindy and Shelly Smith, 35-year-old identical twins, look exactly alike.</p>
<p>Cindy was a straight-A student in high school, went to college, and then to law school. She is presently campaigning for election to the State Senate. Shelly got into the wrong crowd in high school, became addicted to cocaine, and moved to Europe without graduating from high school. </p>
<p>Cindy and Shelly have not spoken for years, and very few people know that Cindy has a twin. Debbie, a high school classmate of Cindy and Shelly, dislikes Cindy and does not want Cindy to win her election. Debbie obtained an old photograph of Shelly snorting a line of cocaine and sent it to Newspaper the day before the election, with an anonymous note that read, &ldquo;Ms. Smith is a cokehead.&rdquo; The photograph was very clear and looked exactly like Cindy.</p>
<p>Newspaper, unaware that Cindy had an identical twin sister, published the photograph of Shelly the same day, with a caption that read, &ldquo;Cokehead for State Senate?&rdquo; Newspaper reported that it had received the photograph of &ldquo;Cindy Smith&rdquo; anonymously earlier that day. Cindy was very distressed about Newspaper&rsquo;s publication and subsequently lost the election.</p>
<p>Thereafter, Cindy filed defamation claims against both Debbie and Newspaper.</p>
<p>1. What is the likely outcome of Cindy&rsquo;s defamation claim against Debbie? Discuss.<br />
    2. What is the likely outcome of Cindy&rsquo;s defamation claim against Newspaper? Discuss.<br /> 
 </p>
<p>Solution A</p>
<p>Defamation is a defamatory statement of or concerning the plaintiff published to a third party that results in damages.<br />
    Defamatory statement<br />
    A defamatory statement is a false statement that when published might tend to harm one&rsquo;s reputation or standing in the community.<br />
    Here, Debbie claimed that Cindy was a cokehead. Doing cocaine is looked down upon and the statement made about Cindy will surely make people look down upon her. This is injurious to one's reputation and could affect Cindy's relationships, and business advantages. The statement is also false. This will be considered a defamatory statement.<br />
    Of or concerning plaintiff<br />
    In order for a cause of action for defamation to be upheld, the defamatory statement must be about the plaintiff, and the receiving party of the statement must realize that the statement is about the plaintiff.<br />
    Here, Cindy is running for the State Senate and is currently campaigning. Therefore, people in the community know who Cindy is, and recognize her face. When Debbie sent the note to Newspaper, it said &quot;Ms. Smith is a cokehead.&quot; This, in itself, might not be enough to satisfy this requirement of the defamation claim. Newspaper might not have known who Ms. Smith was. Coupled with the picture of Cindy's twin sister, who<br />
    looks exactly like Cindy, makes it clear that Debbie was intending to tell Newspaper that Cindy was a cokehead. The newspaper interpreted the statement as being about Cindy. This is evidenced by the fact that they published an article about it later on.<br />
    Published to a third party<br />
    The defamatory statement must be published to a third party to support a defamation claim. Publication requires that the intended recipient be able to hear, read, or understand the statement.<br />
    Here, Debbie sent the note containing the statement to Newspaper, a third party. They were able to read the note written by Debbie, and understand that Debbie was calling Cindy a cokehead, by reference to the picture.<br />
    Damages<br />
    The type of damages Cindy is entitled to is dependent on the type of defamation that occurred here.<br />
    Libel<br />
    Libel is defamation that is written.<br />
    In a case for libel, general damages are presumed, and plaintiff will recover those general damages. Plaintiff can also produce evidence of other damages, such as pecuniary loss, to increase his or her damage award.<br />
Here, Debbie wrote the note to Newspaper, which qualifies as libel. Because the defamatory statement was in the form of libel, Cindy will be able to recover general damages for past, present, and future pain and suffering. If Cindy offers evidence of her pecuniary loss she may be able to recover lost wages as well.</p>
<p>Slander<br />
    Slander is defamation that is spoken. In a case for slander, the plaintiff will have to prove actual pecuniary loss to recover any damages, unless the slander is slander per se. Slander per se is a defamatory statement referencing the plaintiff in a professional capacity, accuses him or her of a crime of moral turpitude, accuses a woman of being unchaste, or of having a loathsome disease.<br />
    Debbie will argue that although her statement was in the form of a note, it was not something that would be permanent. The note was later just going to be tossed in the trash, and thus wouldn't have the same effects as libel. Libel is written and damages are measured differently because it is assumed that a written statement will reach a wider audience. This little note would not reach that wide audience. Debbie would argue that this is simple slander, and that Cindy would need to offer evidence of actual damages. Debbie will not prevail in that argument because she wrote the note to the Newspaper, who she was sure would publish an article about it.<br />
    Even if Debbie prevailed in her argument, this would be considered slander per se because Debbie is accusing Cindy of committing a crime. Cindy would still be able to recover presumed general damages.<br />
    Will Debbie be liable for the republishing of the defamatory statement by Newspaper?<br />
    Debbie's liability will not stop at her note that she wrote to Newspaper: she will be liable for the information published by Newspaper, because she was the actual and proximate cause of Newspaper publishing the defamatory statement.<br />
    Actual cause<br />
    Actual cause is measured by the but-for test. But for Debbie writing the note to Newspaper with the picture, Newspaper would not have published an article about it.</p>
<p>Proximate cause<br />
    Proximate cause is measured by foreseeability. It was foreseeable that if Debbie supplied the Newspaper with information about a person running for the Senate, that they would publish it.<br />
    Debbie will therefore be liable to Cindy for the Newspaper publishing the information. Defenses<br />
    Qualified privilege<br />
    Debbie might argue that she had a qualified privilege to publish the information about someone who was running for the Senate because it is in the public&rsquo;s interest to know if the person that they are voting in to office to represent them is a &quot;cokehead&quot;. While this might be of interest to the public if the fact were true, the statement was not true, so Debbie exceeded the scope of her privilege.<br />
    Truth<br />
    If the defamatory statement is true, it will act as a defense to a defamation claim.<br />
    Debbie will argue that the statement she published to Newspaper was, in fact, true. She stated that &quot;Ms. Smith&quot; was a cokehead. She included a picture of Cindy's twin sister Shelly. Debbie might contend that she was actually talking about Shelly Smith when she sent the letter. Her argument will fail. The facts tell us that Debbie does not like Cindy, and that she did not want Cindy to win her election. She sent the note to the Newspaper intending that they interpret the information as being about Cindy Smith, which they did. The statement as represented was therefore not truthful.</p>
<p>Constitutional privileges<br />
    The First Amendment protects freedom of speech. The amendment protects people who are speaking fact or opinion, but does not permit people to publish false, injurious statements about others freely. Due to constitutional requirements, there may be additional factors in a defamation claim if the statement was made about a public concern.<br />
    Public Concern<br />
    Here, the defamatory statement is a matter of public concern because the public has a right to know whether the person they are electing into office is a cokehead. Because this is a matter of public concern, the plaintiff must prove fault with respect to the defendant. If the plaintiff is a public figure, he or she must prove that the defendant acted with malice.<br />
    Public figure<br />
    Here, Cindy is a public figure as she is within the public eye. The public knows who she is, as she has interjected herself into public view with her campaigning efforts. Because she is a public figure, Cindy will have to show that Debbie acted with malice to recover.<br />
    Malice<br />
    A defendant acts with malice if he or she intentionally publishes a defamatory statement, knowing it is false, or published it with reckless disregard as to its truth.<br />
    Here, Debbie published the statement to Newspaper with the intent that they construe it to be about Cindy Smith, and they did. She knew that the information was false when construed that way, and sent it anyway. Debbie therefore acted with malice, and Cindy can recover damages as discussed supra.</p>
<p>Cindy V. Newspaper Defamation<br />
    defined supra Defamatory statement defined supra<br />
    As to the statement &quot;Ms. Smith is a cokehead&quot;, coupled with the picture, discussed supra. The Newspaper published a similar statement, &quot;Cokehead for State Senate?&quot; This statement is defamatory in that it would be harmful to one&rsquo;s reputation who is running for State Senate to be considered a cokehead. People will most likely not vote for one who is a cokehead, and it would injure Cindy's reputation in the community.<br />
    Of or concerning plaintiff<br />
    defined supra<br />
    Here, the Newspaper published the article containing the picture of Shelly Smith, who the Newspaper believed to be Cindy Smith. The two look exactly alike, and hardly anyone was aware that Cindy had a twin sister. They included the caption &quot;Cokehead for State Senate?&quot; Although the Newspaper does not include Cindy's name, it can be implied that they are referring to Cindy, when the caption is coupled with the picture. The public would interpret the caption to be about Cindy, as Cindy has been campaigning for election and her face is known.<br />
    Published to a third party defined supra</p>
<p>Here, the statement by Newspaper was published in the newspaper, and possibly distributed, and available for purchase by the public. As discussed supra, the public would understand that the statement was about Cindy, and anyone who can read would understand the statement as saying that Cindy was a cokehead.<br />
    Damages defined supra Libel<br />
    defined supra<br />
    Here, the statement was written in the Newspaper and published to a third party, the public. The Newspaper is a fairly permanent form of publication. Damages here will be presumed, and as discussed supra.<br />
    Constitutional privileges discussed supra<br />
    Public concern discussed supra<br />
    Public figure discussed supra</p>
<p>Malice<br />
    defined supra<br />
    Here, the Newspaper did not intentionally publish a statement that they knew was false. They had no reason to believe the statement to be false, as there was a picture with Ms. Smith snorting cocaine. They did not know, or have reason to know, that Cindy had a twin sister. Because Cindy cannot show that the Newspaper acted with reckless disregard, she cannot prove malice. She can at best prove negligence, which is not the standard here. She will not recover from Newspaper.<br />
    Qualified privileges<br />
    Same as Debbie discussed supra<br />
    Cindy will not recover from Newspaper, but will recover from Debbie, who will also be liable for the republishing done by Newspaper.</p>
<p>Solution B</p>
<p>Defamation<br />
    A defamatory statement of or concerning plaintiff published to a third party who understood it and caused damages to plaintiff.<br />
    Defamatory Statement<br />
    A defamatory statement is one that causes plaintiff to lose creditability in the community and thus causes damages to her reputation.<br />
    Here, Debbie sent Newspaper an old photograph of Shelly (Cindy's identical twin sister) wherein Shelly was snorting a line of cocaine. The fact pattern states that Debbie went to high school with Cindy and Shelly and dislikes Cindy and does not want her to win her election. Here the statement is defamatory because a published photo of a person doing drugs would be disgraceful and make the person in the photo lose creditability in the community.<br />
    Therefore the statement was defamatory.<br />
    Of or Concerning Plaintiff<br />
    The defamatory statement must be of or concerning plaintiff.<br />
    Here the statement is concerning plaintiff as she was running for election and Debbie purposefully sent a photo to Newspaper of Shelly who is Cindy's identical sister for the purposes of making Cindy lose her election. Thus the statement is concerning plaintiff.<br />
Therefore the statement is concerning plaintiff.</p>
<p>Published to a third party who understood it<br />
    Here the statement was sent to Newspaper who did not know that Cindy had an identical twin sister named Shelly but rather understood it to be Cindy on the photograph because Debbie submitted the photograph the day before the election with a note that read &quot;Ms. Smith is a cokehead.&quot; Here the facts indicate that Newspaper was &quot;unaware that Cindy had an identical twin sister&quot;; thus it understood that the picture was Cindy.<br />
    Therefore it was published to a third party who understood it.<br />
    Damages<br />
    Plaintiff must prove actual damages or pecuniary damages to prevail in a defamation suit unless Libel or Slander Per Se can be proven.<br />
    Libel<br />
    Libel is written defamation and damages are presumed under this type of suit because they are in written form and published to third parties and are presumed to damage plaintiff&rsquo;s reputation.<br />
    Here, Debbie anonymously sent Newspaper the photo of Shelly and wrote &quot;Ms. Smith is a cokehead&quot;; thus constitutes libel defamation. Cindy was running for State Senate; thus this type of publication would demolish Cindy's reputation in her community. She may be entitled to recover actual damages as well as any pecuniary damages she suffered from the defamatory statement.<br />
    Constitutional Limitations<br />
    When a matter is of public concern or the plaintiff is a public figure two additional elements must be proved: 1) fault of defendant and 2) falsity of statement.</p>
<p>Here, the defamatory statement is one of public concern as Cindy is running for State Senate and is newsworthy to the public. Second Cindy would likely be considered a Public Figure.<br />
    Public Figure<br />
    A public figure is a person who has gained recognition in the community through fame or public interest or is a central person in a political movement.<br />
    Here Cindy is running for a State Senate position and is likely a famous figure in the community as she has campaigned and traveled throughout her community for election purposes. Further the newspaper knows of her status; thus she is likely a public figure.<br />
    Therefore Cindy is a public figure.<br />
    Fault<br />
    Plaintiff must prove that defendant was at fault for the defamatory publication.<br />
    Here, Cindy can show that Debbie was at fault for publishing a false picture of her to the Newspaper. Further she can argue that Debbie knew that the picture was of her twin sister Shelly and not her.<br />
    Therefore Debbie was at fault.<br />
    Falsity<br />
    Plaintiff must prove that the defamatory statement was false. A public figure must prove that defendant acted with malice, which is the reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the defamatory statement.<br />
    Here, Debbie knew that the photo she published to Newspaper was false because the picture was in fact of Shelly, who is Cindy's identical twin sister. Therefore Cindy may</p>
<p>prove that Debbie acted with malice as it relates to the truth or falsity of the defamatory statement published to Newspaper.<br />
    Damages<br />
    Cindy may recover from Debbie any lost earnings that she may have encountered as a result of the defamatory statement published by Debbie.<br />
    Defenses<br />
    Qualified Privilege<br />
    A qualified privilege is not a complete defense and may be used if the defamatory statement is in the interest of the public and publisher or it regards a public concern that the public considers newsworthy.<br />
    Here, Debbie may argue that this picture is newsworthy because it concerns the State Senate position; thus the public would likely find it newsworthy and thus the statement was a qualified privilege. This argument is not likely to prevail as the picture was not in fact of Cindy but rather her twin sister who was understood as Cindy, thus not valid. Although publicly newsworthy, it lowered Cindy's reputation and more importantly it was a false statement and done with malice on Debbie's part.<br />
    Therefore this defense will not prevail.<br />
    Therefore Cindy may succeed in a defamation claim against Debbie.<br />
    2. What is the likely outcome of Cindy's defamation claim against Newspaper?<br />
    Defamation<br />
    A defamatory statement of and concerning plaintiff published to a third party who understood it and caused damages to plaintiff.</p>
<p>Defamatory Statement (defined above)<br />
    Here, as noted above Newspaper republished the photo which it received anonymously from Debbie of Cindy's twin sister snorting coke. This picture is defamatory as it would lower the reputation of any reasonable person in their respective community if published to a third party.<br />
    Republishing Party<br />
    A party who republishes a defamatory statement may be held liable for defamation for republishing such defamatory statement; this includes newspapers and retailers.<br />
    Here, Newspaper will remain liable to Cindy for republishing the photo that Debbie sent them.<br />
    Opinion<br />
    A defense to a defamatory statement is that the defendant made the statement as an opinion rather than a defamatory remark.<br />
    Here, Newspaper may argue that it was making an opinion of Cindy rather than a defamatory remark as the written language illustrates &quot;Cokehead for State Senate?&quot; This argument is not likely to prevail as the picture is self-explanatory and the third parties would likely understand that Newspaper is saying that Cindy is a cokehead rather than giving a biased opinion.<br />
    Therefore the statement was defamatory.<br />
    Of or Concerning Plaintiff (defined above)<br />
    Here, as mentioned above the statement was concerning plaintiff as Debbie intentionally published the statement to Newspaper and Newspaper republished the</p>
<p>statement by publishing the photo of Shelly with the caption that read &quot;Cokehead for State Senate&quot;.<br />
    Therefore the defamatory statement was concerning plaintiff.<br />
    Published to a third party who understood it (defined above)<br />
    As mentioned Newspaper will remain liable for the photo it published of Shelly with reference to Cindy. The people who read their newspaper article understood the photo to be of Cindy and not Shelly; thus it was understood that the photo which Newspaper republished was of Cindy, who was running for State Senate.<br />
    Therefore the third party did understand the photo was in reference of Cindy. Damages (defined above)<br />
    Libel (defined above)<br />
    Here, damages are presumed as the defamatory statement damaged Cindy's reputation in her community because a photo of a person doing drugs would lower the creditability of an individual in the community; thus the defamatory statement caused Cindy damages. Cindy may be able to recover actual damages as well as pecuniary damages sustained as a result of the defamatory statement. Lastly the loss of her election.<br />
    Constitutional Limits (defined above)<br />
    Public Figure (defined above)<br />
    As mentioned above Cindy would be considered a Public Figure because of her campaign and fame in the community. Further this is a matter of public concern; thus it</p>
<p>is newsworthy to the public. Cindy must prove malice on the part of Newspaper to prevail.<br />
    Fault (defined above)<br />
    Here, Cindy may prove that Newspaper was at fault in republishing the photo without taking adequate care of informing itself as to the truth of the photo. Newspaper may argue that they published the photo immediately the same day as they received it because the election day was the following day and they could not wait to clarify its truth and they were not aware of the twin sister. This argument may not suffice as Newspaper has a duty to reasonably report prompt news.<br />
    Fault is proven here.<br />
    Falsity (defined above)<br />
    Cindy must prove Newspaper acted with malice.<br />
    Here, it will be difficult for Cindy to prove that Newspaper acted with a reckless disregard to the truth or falsity of its statements because Newspaper did not know that Cindy had an identical twin sister, unlike Debbie who went to high school with them. Further Newspaper could not make a reasonable inference to its truth as the election was the next day and was in the interest of the public to know of this photo because Cindy was running for State Senate.<br />
    Falsity not present here.<br />
    Therefore Cindy may not prevail against Newspaper.</p>
<p>Defenses<br />
    Qualified Privilege (defined above)<br />
    As mentioned above, Newspaper may too argue that it was in the interest of the public to know of this photo as Cindy was running for State Senate and was in the interest of the public as well as the publisher; thus they had a qualified privilege. Lastly, Newspaper may argue that it did not act with malice, which is the standard of falsity Cindy must prove; thus it cannot be liable to Cindy under a defamation claim.<br />

<p><strong>October 2009</strong></p>
<p>Darby organized a political rally attended by approximately 1,000 people in support of a candidate challenging the incumbent in the upcoming mayoral election. Sheila, the wife of the challenging candidate, was the main speaker. When Darby introduced Sheila, he described her as a &ldquo;. . .kind woman of the people.&rdquo; In his introduction he also referred to Patty, the wife of the current mayor, as &ldquo;. . . a snob, who is so cutthroat that she said very nasty things about her closest friend when that friend applied for membership to an exclusive private women&rsquo;s club of which Patty is a member.&rdquo; Darby&rsquo;s statements were reported in the print and television media.</p>
<p>Darby had heard this information about Patty from a notorious local gossip and the information was largely false. In fact, when Patty&rsquo;s friend was rejected for club membership, Patty was one of her staunchest supporters in the application process. Darby&rsquo;s statement put a strain on Patty&rsquo;s relationship with her friend who, upon hearing of</p>
<p>Darby&rsquo;s comments, cancelled an upcoming lunch she and Patty had scheduled several weeks before the rally.</p>
<p>At the time Darby spoke at the rally, Patty had not been involved publicly in her husband&rsquo;s campaign or political activities. Two days before the rally, Patty appeared with her husband in public for the first time when she learned that Sheila was going to speak at the rally.</p>
<p>1. Under what theory, or theories, if any, might Patty bring an action against Darby? Discuss.<br />
    2. What defense or defenses, if any, might Darby assert, and what is the likely result? Discuss.</p>
<p><strong>Solution A</strong></p>
<p>DEFAMATION<br />
    <br />
    PATTY V. DARBY<br />
    Defamation is a false and defamatory statement published to third persons, understood by those third persons as relating to Plaintiff, which actually and proximately causes damage to Plaintiff&rsquo;s reputation.<br />
    FALSITY: Darby stated that Patty was a &ldquo;snob,&rdquo; that she said &ldquo;nasty things&rdquo; about her friend when her friend applied for membership in a club.<br />
    OPINION: Darby&rsquo;s statement that Patty was a snob was his own opinion. It does not relate to a factual matter.<br />
    FACT: Darby&rsquo;s statement about Patty&rsquo;s interfering with her friend&rsquo;s application for the club is false because it relates to an event that did not actually occur.<br />
    Darby may state that he heard the information from someone else and was merely republishing it. However, because the person he heard this information from was a &ldquo;notorious gossip,&rdquo; Darby will be found to have known that it was at least highly possible that the information was not accurate.<br />
    DEFAMATORY: Darby stated that Patty had actively interfered with a friend&rsquo;s club membership by saying &ldquo;nasty things&rdquo; and was snobby. These statements would be understood by anyone to be tending to lower the reputation of the one to whom they referred. Therefore the statements are defamatory.<br />
    PUBLISHED TO THIRD PERSONS: Darby&rsquo;s statements were made in front of an audience of 1,000 people. Therefore they were published.<br />
</p>
<p>UNDERSTOOD TO BE ABOUT PLAINTIFF: The people at the rally understood that Darby was speaking of Patty the Mayor&rsquo;s wife. Therefore his comments could not be understood to be about another woman named Patty, but only about this particular woman.<br />
    CAUSATION: But for Darby&rsquo;s statements to the people at the rally, Patty would not have suffered the loss in reputation that she suffered. Furthermore, it was foreseeable that making these defamatory statements in the public arena would cause a substantial number of people to believe the statements and therefore that the Plaintiff&rsquo;s reputation would be lowered in the estimation of a sizable portion of the attendees.<br />
    DAMAGE TO REPUTATION: Patty&rsquo;s reputation was at least lowered in the estimation of the friend whose club membership she had actually supported. Because this friend had been rejected for membership and because she now believed that Patty was the result of that rejection, Friend cancelled her lunch with Patty.<br />
    The courts will see even the loss of a gratuity, such as a lunch, as damages in relation to defamation. Therefore Patty has suffered sufficient loss of reputation for defamation to lie.<br />
    LIABILITY FOR REPUBLICATION<br />
    The original tortfeasor will be liable for all the damage caused by republishers.<br />
    Here, Darby&rsquo;s statements were republished by the print and television media. Because these media have substantial viewers and readers, Patty&rsquo;s damages will be seen to have been aggravated by the republication. Patty&rsquo;s damages can be assessed by means of polls or other measures.<br />
    Darby will be liable for all damages subsequently proven by Patty to have been sustained by her as a result of the republications.<br />
</p>
<p>DEFENSES TO DEFAMATION<br />
    Constitutional Defenses<br />
    Public Figure:<br />
    Darby will argue that Patty was a public figure because she was the mayor&rsquo;s wife and this was an election year. Darby will state that because Patty was a public figure, he should only be held liable if his statements were made with actual malice, that is, intentionally or in reckless disregard of the truth.<br />
    The court may determine that Patty&rsquo;s status as the mayor&rsquo;s wife is one of public figure. However, because Darby&rsquo;s information came from a &ldquo;notorious gossip,&rdquo; the court will likely find that Darby should have known that the information was probably false. It is likely that he will be found to have acted at least recklessly in relation to the truth of the statements he made. Therefore, this defense will not be applicable.<br />
    Private Figure in Public Matter<br />
    Patty will argue that she was not a public figure, that her husband handled the mayoral duties without her, and that she led a quiet life unrelated to her husband&rsquo;s job. However, because she had joined her husband at a political rally two days before the rally at which Darby spoke, the court may find that she had assumed the status of a private figure in a public matter in relation to the current election.<br />
    If the court finds that Patty is a private figure in a public matter, Darby will state that his statements relating to Patty&rsquo;s alleged treatment of her friend are within the scope of public interest in the election of a mayor. Patty will argue that Darby exceeded the limits of Gertz in that his false, defamatory statements were made at least negligently, most likely recklessly, and perhaps even intentionally.<br />
    This defense will not work.<br />
</p>
<p>Darby will be liable for defamation.<br />
    Damages:<br />
    Special Damages: Patty lost the lunch she was going to have with her friend.<br />
    General Damages: Because Patty can prove special damages, she can recover for mental suffering and loss of reputation in the community. She will recover from Darby for all losses sustained through the subsequent republication by the print and television media as well.<br />
    Punitive Damages: Patty will probably be able to prove that Darby&rsquo;s statements were made maliciously. Therefore punitive damages will be available.</p>
<p><strong>Solution B</strong></p>
<p>I. Patty v. Darby<br />
    Answer B to Question 1<br />
    Defamation. Patty may assert a claim against Darby for defamation.<br />
    Defamation is a defamatory statement concerning the plaintiff, published to a third party, causing reputational harm.<br />
    Defamatory Statement. A defamatory statement is a false statement adversely affecting the reputation of the plaintiff in the eyes of a respectable minority of the community. Here, Darby referred to Patty as &ldquo;a snob, who is so cutthroat that she said very nasty things about her closest friend when that friend applied for membership to an exclusive private women&rsquo;s club of which Patty is a member.&rdquo; This statement was &ldquo;largely false,&ldquo; as Patty had been one of her friend&rsquo;s staunchest supporters in the application process. It adversely affected Patty&rsquo;s reputation because it put a strain on her relationship with her friend, who believed the false statement upon hearing Darby&rsquo;s statements. Therefore the statement was defamatory.<br />
    Of and concerning plaintiff. The Plaintiff must be understood to be the subject of the defamatory statement, either by intrinsic or extrinsic evidence. Here, Darby referred to Patty, the wife of the current mayor, in his introduction of Sheila. It clearly identified Patty by name, and it is therefore of and concerning the plaintiff.<br />
    Published to a third party. The defamatory statement must have been communicated to a third party, either intentionally or negligently, and it must have been understood by the third party. Here, Darby made the statement at a political rally attended by approximately 1,000 people, and it was also reported in the print and television media. Darby knew that people would hear his statements, and desired that they hear them, as he was trying to challenge the incumbent during the mayoral election by speaking negatively about the current mayor&rsquo;s wife. He must have also known that the media</p>
<p>would be present, and would report what he said. There was clearly an intentional publication.<br />
    Constitutional Limitations. The level of fault needed to establish defamation depends on the status of the plaintiff and the defendant. Here, Darby is a non-media defendant. If Patty is a public figure, then it must be shown that Darby acted with malice. If Patty is a private figure, and the matter is a public concern, then it must be shown that Darby acted with malice. If Patty is a private figure, and the matter is a private concern, then it must only be shown that Darby was negligent. Here, Patty had not been publicly involved in her husband&rsquo;s campaign or public activities. This would make her a private figure. However, she had appeared in public for the first time two days before the rally. As she made her appearance when she learned that the wife of the challenging candidate would appear, then Patty&rsquo;s appearance was made in connection with her husband&rsquo;s campaign, making it a matter of public concern. Therefore, Darby would need to have acted with malice.<br />
    Malice. Malice is knowledge of the falsity of the statement or reckless disregard to the truth. Here, Darby heard the information about Patty&rsquo;s nasty statements about her friend from a notorious local gossip. This was not a reliable source of information, and the probability that the information was false was very high. Darby would have needed to verify the truth of the information. The facts don&rsquo;t indicate that he did, and therefore he acted with reckless disregard for the truth. Therefore, Darby acted with the requisite malice.<br />
    Damages.<br />
    Slander. Slander is a defamatory statement which is spoken. Here, as stated above, Darby&rsquo;s statements were spoken. Where there is slander, then the plaintiff needs to prove special damages, or pecuniary losses. Pecuniary losses are monetary, such as loss of income or loss of an expected gift. Here, Patty&rsquo;s relationship with her friend was strained as a result of the defamation, and her friend cancelled an upcoming lunch</p>
<p>which had been scheduled weeks before the rally. This is not sufficient to establish that Patty suffered any monetary losses. Patty would not be able to recover absent a showing of such losses. However, where a defendant has acted with malice, then special damages are presumed. Here, as established above, Darby acted with malice, and therefore Patty could recover for the harm suffered.<br />
    Defenses. Darby may not be held liable if he can establish a defense.<br />
    Absolute privilege. One who makes a defamatory statement during the course of a political campaign is privileged as long as they did not act with intent. Here, Darby acted with intent, and therefore would not avail of the privilege.</p>

<p><strong>June 2007</strong></p>
<p>Eight-year-old Hannah attended Camp, a children&rsquo;s summer camp. Some of the children at Camp were resident campers who spent each night in cabins, and others, such as Hannah, were day campers who attended Camp between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. and rode bicycles to and from their nearby suburban homes daily. The bicycles were locked outside each day camper&rsquo;s cabin, with the camper keeping the key to the bicycle.</p>
<p>Rick, a Camp counselor, owned a baseball autographed by Babe Ruth that he had brought with him to Camp to show the campers. One day at 3:00 p.m. after a baseball game at Camp, Rick discovered that his autographed baseball had been put into the ball bag and used in the game. He was very upset to find that Babe Ruth&rsquo;s autograph had been all but worn off as a result.</p>
<p>Rick learned that Hannah had been seen coming out of Rick&rsquo;s cabin a few minutes before the baseball game and that she had sat near the ball bag before the start of the game. He told Hannah that he would not let her ride home until she admitted what she had done. Very upset, Hannah continually protested her innocence until Rick finally told her at 6:30 p.m. that she could get her bike and ride home. She lived approximately one-half mile from Camp.</p>
<p>When Hannah&rsquo;s parents asked the Camp Director why their daughter had been so late in getting home, the Director told them what had happened. The Director added that he would never have allowed Rick to keep Hannah so late had he been aware of it. He also told Hannah&rsquo;s parents that Hannah had not taken Rick&rsquo;s ball. In fact, her eight-year-old campmate, Jessie, confessed that she had placed Rick&rsquo;s autographed baseball in the ball bag.</p>
<p>1. On what theory or theories, if any, might an action be brought on Hannah&rsquo;s behalf against Rick, what defenses might Rick assert, and what is the likely outcome? Discuss fully.</p>
<p>2. On what theory or theories, if any, might an action be brought on Hannah&rsquo;s behalf against Camp, what defense might Camp assert, and what is the likely outcome? Discuss fully. </p>
<p>Solution A</p>
<p>Defamation?<br />
    Defamation is a defamatory statement made of and about the plaintiff which caused harm.<br />
    Defamatory Statement?<br />
    Rick accused Hannah of stealing without sufficient facts to prove the statement was true. Since both parties are private and this didn&rsquo;t concern a public matter, there is no malice or negligence requirement and falsity is presumed. The falseness was also later shown when Jessie confessed. Rick should have done more investigation before accusing Hannah because he based his accusation on the fact Hannah had been coming out of his cabin and near the ball bag. Here, the statement was of and about Hannah and defamatory.<br />
    Published?<br />
    It is not clear if this statement was published, but possibly others overheard Rick&rsquo;s accusations due to his negligence in having loud conversations. Since a statement that Hannah steals is a crime, the slanderous statement would have presumed damages.<br />
Here, Rick will be liable for defamation for any negligent publishing that Hannah had stolen the ball. Since Rick believed the statement was true, he can defend that he based his accusation of overhearing Hannah had been in his tent and near the ball bag.</p>

<p>June 2009</p>
<p>Al, Bob, Carl, and Dolly were coworkers at Zco. Al, Bob, and Carl did not like Dolly and wanted her fired from Zco.<br />
    On Monday, all employees of Zco were required to attend a mandatory meeting. Prior to the meeting, Al entered Dolly&rsquo;s office and told her not to leave her office until the meeting was over. He then said to her, &ldquo;If you leave this office before the meeting is over, some of my friends and I will come to your home and beat you up.&rdquo; Al then left for the meeting. Dolly, scared for her safety, remained in her office, missed the meeting, and was reprimanded by Carl, her supervisor.<br />
    On Tuesday, Bob placed a sleeping pill in Dolly&rsquo;s coffee when Dolly was not looking. Dolly drank the coffee and fell asleep at her desk twenty minutes later. She slept for four hours, and was again reprimanded by Carl for sleeping on the job.<br />
    On Wednesday, the Human Resources Manager for Zco asked Carl if he knew why Dolly had missed the meeting on Monday and fell asleep at her desk on Tuesday. Carl responded that Dolly had a serious drinking problem that interfered with her job performance. Carl was aware of the actual reasons why Dolly had missed the meeting on Monday and fell asleep on Tuesday, and he had no reason to believe that she had a drinking problem. On Thursday, Dolly was fired from Zco.<br />
    Under what intentional tort theories might an action for damages be brought by Dolly against Al, Bob, and Carl, and what defenses, if any, might Al, Bob, or Carl assert, and what are the likely results?<br />
Discuss.</p>
<p>Solution A</p>
<p>Dolly v. Carl &ndash; Defamation<br />
    Dolly may have a cause of action against Carl for defamation.<br />
    Defamation is a defamatory statement of and concerning the plaintiff that is published and causes damages to plaintiff&rsquo;s reputation.<br />
    Defamatory Statement &ndash; A statement is defamatory if it holds the plaintiff up to scorn or ridicule or lowers plaintiff&rsquo;s esteem in a minority of respectable community. Here, Carl&rsquo;s statement that Dolly has a serious drinking problem would be defamatory in that it would lower her esteem among her coworkers.<br />
    Of and concerning the plaintiff<br />
    The defamatory statement must be understood as to be about the plaintiff. Here, Carl&rsquo;s statement was defamatory on its face in that it was made to the Human Resources Manager in response to her question about Dolly missing the meeting and falling asleep<br />
&#65532;&#65532;&#65532;&#65532;&#65532;&#65532;7</p>
<p>at her desk. Therefore, Dolly will not have to provide any extrinsic facts to show the statement was made about her.<br />
    Published to &ndash; The defamatory statement must be intentionally or negligently published to a third person. Here, Carl intentionally made the statement to the Human Resources Manager; therefore it was published.<br />
    Damages to the Plaintiff<br />
    Slander per se is slander in which damages are presumed and the plaintiff will not have to prove special damages. (Slander is any form of oral defamation.) One way to establish slander per se is if the defamatory statement implies misconduct of one&rsquo;s business trade or profession. Here, Carl&rsquo;s statement that Dolly had a drinking problem that interfered with her job performance would impute that Dolly&rsquo;s drinking problem caused professional misconduct.<br />
    Therefore, Dolly will be entitled to damages.<br />
    Defenses<br />
    Conditional privilege<br />
    Carl will assert that he was privileged to make the defamatory statement about Dolly since he was her supervisor and the statement was made to the Human Resources Manager regarding her work. However, Carl will lose this privilege because he acted intentionally by making the statement he knew was false because the facts show that he was aware of the real reason Dolly missed the meeting. Therefore, Carl will be liable to Dolly for percuniary and nonpecuniary damages for defamation.</p>
<p>Solution B</p>
<p>Dolly v. Carl:<br />
    Defamation:<br />
    Slander Per Se (as to Business)<br />
    Defamation is the false defamatory statement publicated [sic] to a 3rd party, wherein the 3rd party knows and understands the statement to be of and concerning the plaintiff in which the plaintiff suffers damages.<br />
    Carl told the Human Resources Manager that Dolly had a serious drinking problem that interfered with her work.<br />
    Carl knew this to be false because he knew that Bob had given her sleeping pills. By the H.R. Manager believing Dolly to be a drinker, this could lower her esteem within her workplace and, therefore, the statement was defamatory.<br />
    Carl spoke this to the H.R. Manager, which [sic] was a 3rd person, and it was directly related to Dolly and the H.R. Manager understood it to be of and concerning Dolly since that is who he inquired about.<br />
    Dolly lost her job as a result of Carl&rsquo;s words about her performance. Because the slander was directed to her business involvement, damages are presumed.<br />
    Carl will be liable for defamation absent any defense.<br />
    Defenses to Defamation:<br />
    Truth:<br />
    The facts state Carl &ldquo;was aware of the actual reason.&rdquo; This is not a valid defense.<br />
&#65532;&#65532;&#65532;&#65532;&#65532;12</p>
<p>Qualified Privilege:<br />
    The facts state that Carl was aware of the actual reason and had &ldquo;no&rdquo; reason to believe that she had a drinking problem. This means that the statement made by Carl was not in good faith, which extinguishes his privilege to the employer.<br />
    Injurious Falsehood:<br />
    An act by Carl which purposefully interferes and causes another not to deal with Dolly. Carl told the H.R. Manager that Dolly had a &ldquo;drinking problem.&rdquo; This statement was intended to cause the H.R. Manager not to deal with Dolly any further.<br />
    Dolly was fired as a result, which she suffered damages.<br />
    Carl will be liable for injurious falsehood, absent any applicable defenses.<br />
    Interference with Expectancy of a Contract:<br />
    One is liable if he intentionally interferes with the expectancy of another in dealings in a contract.<br />
    The facts indicate that Dolly was fired for her &ldquo;alcohol use,&rdquo; which was false. Carl told this purposely to get Dolly into trouble. This was an intentional interference between his corporation and her. She suffered damages by being fired.<br />
    Carl will be liable absent any valid defense.</p>
