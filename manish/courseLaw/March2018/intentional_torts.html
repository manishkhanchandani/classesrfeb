<p>Intentional Torts</p>
<p>Definition 1. ASSAULT?</p>
<p>Under tort law ASSAULT is an intentional act done to cause and that does cause reasonable<br />
    apprehension of a battery, a harmful or offensive touching of the person. </p>
<p>An act is intentional if it is for the purpose or with knowledge with reasonable certainty a result will occur. </p>
<p>Definition 2. BATTERY?</p>
<p>Under tort law a battery is an intentional act done to cause a harmful or offensive touching. </p>
<p>Definition 3. CONVERSION?</p>
<p>Under tort law CONVERSION is an intentional act to cause and that does cause interference with the chattel of the plaintiff resulting in substantial deprivation of possession. The proscribed legal remedy is forced purchase by the defendant, but the plaintiff may &ldquo;waive the tort&rdquo; and seek restitution instead. </p>
<p>Definition 4. FALSE IMPRISONMENT?<br />
Under tort law a false imprisonment is an intentional act causing the plaintiff to be confined to a defined space against their will with no reasonably apparent means of reasonable exit. The plaintiff must be aware of the confinement. </p>
<p>Definition 5. INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS?<br />
Under tort law intentional infliction is an intentional, outrageous act causing the plaintiff severe emotional distress. Generally emotional distress will not be assumed, and the plaintiff must present evidence showing that they did, in fact, suffer severe emotional distress. Evidence of mere humiliation and embarrassment is generally not enough. </p>
<p>Definition 6. TRESPASS TO LAND?</p>
<p>Under tort law a trespass to land is an intentional act causing unauthorized entry onto, under or over the land of another. The entry may be by the defendant personally or by some person or object directed or placed on the land by the defendant. When an object is placed on the land it constitutes a &ldquo;continuing trespass.&rdquo; No damage is necessary, but the defendant is liable for all damage actually caused. And if malice can be shown the defendant may be liable for punitive damages. </p>
<p>Definition 7. TRESPASS TO CHATTELS?</p>
<p>Under tort law TRESPASS TO CHATTEL is an intentional act by the defendant causing unauthorized interference with or damage to the chattel of the plaintiff. </p>
<p>Definition 8. TRANSFERRED INTENT?<br />
    Under tort law transferred intent means that a defendant that acts with intent to commit any tort injury on anyone will be liable for every injury inflicted on everyone, even if the person injured or the injury suffered is not what was originally intended. </p>
<p>An exception is that Courts generally will not find IIED based on transferred intent, and Courts may find only negligence and not an intentional tort by transferred intent if the original intent of the defendant was not malicious.</p>
<p>Definition 9. DAMAGES for TORTS?<br />
    Every defendant that commits any tort is liable for all actual damages actually and proximately caused. Damages consist of SPECIAL DAMAGES, compensation for monetary losses, and GENERAL DAMAGES, compensation for pain, suffering, anxiety, emotional distress, inconvenience, etc. Defendants who commit intentional torts, including gross negligence (deliberate breach of duty) and recklessness (deliberate creation of unreasonable risks) may also be liable for PUNITIVE DAMAGES if the Court finds they acted with FRAUD, OPPRESSION or MALICE, an evil or wrongful intent to cause harm. Defendants who commit accidentally negligent torts are not liable for punitive damages. Tort plaintiffs have a right to &ldquo;waive the tort&rdquo; and demand RESTITUTION instead of compensation for damages.</p>

    Practice Question 1<br />
    Clark Kent, star reporter for the Daily Planet was approached by panhandler Bill Gates and asked for a quarter. As a prank, Kent (who was secretly Superman) lifted and very gently flew Gates hundreds of feet up to the top of the World Tribune building and left Gates there on a ledge.<br />
    Kent hovered over the World Tribune building and never touched the surface of the building. During the flight Gates was apprehensive he might fall, but Kent had a strong grip.<br />
    Gates was embarrassed and the crowd below taunted him for hours as the fire department tried to devise a means of rescue. Gates was humiliated.<br />
    As he stood on the ledge Gates accidentally knocked a decorative panel loose. It fell to the ground and injured fireman Frank.<br />
    Suddenly Gates discovered that there was an unlocked window next to him all the time. He opened the window and escaped immediately.<br />
Discuss Kent's liability to Gates, the World Tribune and fireman Frank.</p>
<p>[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This question has all of the common law intentional torts except for conversion and trespass to chattels. Why did Kent act? Because he intended to pull a &ldquo;prank.&rdquo; That fact expressly proves his acts were intentional. His physical acts imply intent, but the fact he wanted to pull a &ldquo;prank&rdquo; expressly proves intent. That saves you time.<br />
    Be prepared for batteries that cause &ldquo;offense&rdquo; but not harm. Being pushed around by a stranger is offensive to a reasonable person, and be prepared to state that.<br />
    The whole purpose of having fireman Frank hurt is to raise the issue of transferred intent. Did you spot the issue? Don&rsquo;t turn to &ldquo;negligence&rdquo; when the acts causing harm are intentional.<br />
    If Frank was injured as the result of negligence by Kent or Gates, he might have no case because of the &ldquo;Fireman&rsquo;s Rule&rdquo; that rescue personnel cannot sue for injuries suffered as a result of the negligence of others that creates the emergency situation to which they have responded. That is often codified in statute, and it expressly recognizes the issue that emergency personnel, by occupation, have assumed the risks of their employment.<br />
    But the Fireman&rsquo;s Rule does not generally extend to injury caused by intentional torts.<br />
    Some professors insist that students &ldquo;always discuss defenses&rdquo;, and if your professor insists on that humor the prof and discuss defenses, even when there are no facts to suggest any. Often this sort of professor also wants the defenses discussed at the end of the essay in a &ldquo;Defenses&rdquo; section.<br />
    But generally the writers of law exam and bar exam questions will guide you by giving you facts to suggest the issues you are to discuss, and if you are not given any facts that suggest an issue it means they don&rsquo;t want you to discuss that issue.<br />
    And generally question writers want and expect you to discuss the issues in the order in which they arise in the fact pattern.<br />
    If no facts are presented to suggest any plausible defense the writer is effectively saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to discuss defenses!&rdquo; Here there are absolutely no facts to suggest that Kent has any plausible defense claims, so I didn&rsquo;t waste my time discussing it.]</p>
<p>Sample Answer 16-1: Intentional Torts<br />
    GATES V. KENT<br />
    1) TORTIOUS ASSAULT?<br />
    Under tort law an assault is an intentional act to cause, and which does cause, reasonable apprehension of an immediate battery, a harmful or offensive touching. An act is intentional if it is for the purpose or with knowledge with reasonable certainty a result will occur.<br />
    Here Kent acted intentionally because he intended to pull a &quot;prank&quot; on Gates. His intent because it was a &quot;prank&quot; was to cause Gates to be &quot;apprehensive&quot;. Gates was &ldquo;apprehensive&rdquo; and that was reasonable because he was held &ldquo;hundreds of feet in the air&rdquo;.<br />
    Therefore, Kent can be liable for assault.<br />
    2) TORTIOUS BATTERY on Gates?<br />
    Under tort law a battery is an intentional act done to cause a harmful or offensive touching.<br />
    Here Kent acted intentionally because he intended to pull a &quot; prank&quot;, and he caused a touching because he &ldquo;lifted and flew&rdquo; Gates into the air. This would be an offensive touching to a reasonable person because it is socially offensive to be grabbed in this manner by a stranger.<br />
    Therefore, Kent can be liable for battery.<br />
    3) FALSE IMPRISONMENT?<br />
    Under tort law a false imprisonment is an intentional act causing the plaintiff to be confined to a defined space against their will with no reasonably apparent means of reasonable exit. The plaintiff must be aware of the confinement.<br />
    Here Kent intentionally acted because it was a &ldquo;prank&rdquo;, and he confined Gates with no reasonably apparent means of reasonable exit because he put him on a &ldquo;ledge&rdquo;. And Gates was aware of his confinement because he was &quot;apprehensive&quot; of falling and &quot;taunted&quot; by the crowd.<br />
    Kent may argue that Gates was not actually confined because all he had to do was go through the &ldquo;window&rdquo;. But that means of exit was not reasonably apparent because even the &ldquo;firemen&rdquo; who tried to get Gates down for &ldquo;hours&rdquo; did not realize discover it.<br />
    Therefore, Kent can be liable for false imprisonment.<br />
    4) INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS?<br />
    <br />
    Under tort law intentional infliction is an intentional, outrageous act causing the plaintiff severe emotional distress. Generally emotional distress will not be assumed, and the plaintiff must present evidence showing that they did, in fact, suffer severe emotional distress. Evidence of mere humiliation and embarrassment is generally not enough.<br />
    Here there was an intentional, outrageous act because Kent &quot;flew&quot; Gates to the top of a building and strand him there in front of a crowd where he was &ldquo;taunted for hours&rdquo;.<br />
    However there is no evidence Gates suffered severe emotional distress because the facts only state that he was &quot;humiliated&quot; and &ldquo;embarrassed&rdquo;.<br />
    Therefore, Kent can only be liable for IIED if Gates presents additional evidence of emotional distress.<br />
    WORLD TRIBUNE V. KENT 5) TRESPASS TO LAND?<br />
    Under tort law a trespass to land is an intentional act causing unauthorized entry onto, under or over the land of another. The entry may be by the defendant personally or by some person or object directed or placed on the land by the defendant. When an object is placed on the land it constitutes a &ldquo;continuing trespass.&rdquo; No damage is necessary, but the defendant is liable for all damage actually caused. And if malice can be shown the defendant may be liable for punitive damages.<br />
    Here Kent was over the land of the World Tribune because he &quot;hovered&quot; over the &quot;building.&quot; And he caused Gates to go onto the land because he put Gates on the &quot;ledge.&quot; This caused actual damage because Gates accidentally caused a &quot;panel to fall.&quot; Additional damages are implied by the fact &ldquo;firemen&rdquo; worked in the building &ldquo;for hours&rdquo; trying to rescue Gates. This disruption probably caused Tribune to suffer lost wages and lost profits.<br />
    Further, the possibility of malice is implied by the fact that Kent worked for one newspaper, the Daily Planet, and he disrupted business activities at what appears to be a competing newspaper, the World Tribune.<br />
    Therefore Kent would be liable for all damages he actually caused Tribune based on trespass to land, and may also be liable for punitive damages if implied malice could be proven.<br />
    FIREMAN FRANK V. KENT<br />
    6) BATTERY by TRANSFERRED INTENT?<br />
    Battery is defined above. Under tort law transferred intent means that a defendant that acts with intent to commit any tort injury on anyone will be liable for every injury inflicted on everyone, even if the person injured or the injury suffered is not what was originally intended. Some Courts limit the application of transferred intent, but it is more likely to be applied when the original tortious act was intended to inflict harm.</p>
<p>Here Kent intentionally acted to cause Gates to suffer assault, battery, false imprisonment and possibly intentional infliction of emotional distress, and he intended to cause a trespass to the land of the World Tribune. In turn, that caused Frank to suffer a &ldquo;harmful touching&rdquo;.<br />
    Therefore, Kent would be liable to Frank for battery by transferred intent.</p>
