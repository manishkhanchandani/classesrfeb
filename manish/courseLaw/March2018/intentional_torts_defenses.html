Aggressors are people who have unreasonably created or increased dangers to others. Courts are split when a defendant unknowingly acts to defend an AGGRESSOR. Under one view the defendant STEPS INTO THE SHOES of the aggressor and has no privilege because the aggressor could not claim self-defense. In other Courts the defendant is privileged to defend the aggressor in a fracas if they act with a REASONABLE BELIEF they are acting to defend an innocent victim of aggression.</p>

<p>Definition 17. SELF-DEFENSE?<br />
    Under tort law a person who is NOT AN AGGRESSOR may act reasonably if NECESSARY to protect their own safety. Modernly the person can &ldquo;hold her ground&rdquo; and has is no duty to retreat in most jurisdictions. Aggressors are people who have unreasonably created or increased dangers to others.<br />
