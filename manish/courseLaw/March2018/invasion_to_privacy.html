<p>Sample Essay</p>
<p>The National Inkwire focused on sensational articles about celebrities, complete with candid pictures taken during private moments. Actress Ellen D. Generate was pursued relentlessly.</p>
<p>One time The National Inkwire reported that Ellen was secretly a generous philanthropist. In fact, Ellen was a tightwad. As a result of the Inkwire article, Ellen was besieged by requests for donations, and it was professionally impossible for her to turn them all down.</p>
<p>Then the Inkwire photographer, Dick took pictures of Ellen sunbathing topless on her sailboat. At the time the photo was taken Ellen was anchored four miles from land in international waters, and she had her friend Anne posted as a lookout to warn of any approaching boats or airplanes. The way Dick got the photo was by using a remote controlled, miniature submarine with a powerful telephoto lens.</p>
<p>Ellen was so embarrassed by the nude photo that she remained secluded in her home for weeks.</p>
<p>Ellen decided to sue the Inkwire, so she went to the grocery store and bought a copy of the issue with her photo to show her lawyer. Unfortunately Dick was following her and he took a picture of Ellen buying the Inkwire. Then Inkwire put the picture of Ellen on billboards nationwide with a caption that said &quot;Ellen D. Generate buys Inkwire!&quot;</p>
<p>Before Ellen could file suit the Inkwire ran an interview with Ellen's old boyfriend from college. He said that even though Ellen was now a strong and vocal anti-abortion advocate, she had an abortion herself in college. This was a true fact that Ellen had told her ex-boyfriend in strictest confidence. This disclosure embarrassed Ellen and made her look like a hypocrite.</p>
<p>Discuss the possible actions Ellen might bring against the Inkwire and their defenses.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning:</strong></p>
<p><strong>philanthropist:</strong> a person who seeks to promote the welfare of others, especially by the generous donation of money to good causes.</p>
<p><strong>besieged:</strong> crowd around oppressively; surround and harass.</p>
<p><strong>tightwad:</strong> a mean or miserly person.</p>
<p>[<strong>ANSWER EXPLANATION:</strong> This question calls for discussion of each of the four Invasion of Privacy torts -- False Light, Appropriation of Likeness, Intrusion and Disclosure of Private Facts (LAID).</p>
<p>The focus in intrusion and disclosure is on the unreasonableness of the acts of the defendant. It is not unreasonable to take a picture of a naked lady if she is lying on a public beach, but it is unreasonable to take the same picture by going to great lengths to avoid detection because it violates &ldquo;reasonable expectations of privacy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;money damages&rdquo; generally means an award intended to compensate the plaintiff for losses suffered in terms of property damage, lost income, inconvenience, lost privacy, embarrassment, pain and suffering, etc. But the plaintiff can also request damages measured by the unjust enrichment the defendant would otherwise reap. In that case the plaintiff is said to have, &ldquo;waived the tort and sued in restitution&rdquo;, and the damage award in that case is often referred to as &ldquo;damages in restitution&rdquo;. In most cases of False Light, Intrusion and Disclosure of Private Facts the plaintiff is suing for compensatory damages, and in most cases of Appropriation of Likeness the plaintiff is suing for damages in restitution.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;damages&rdquo; is broadly misused to mean &ldquo;money judgment&rdquo; and students are strongly advised to get (and read) Nailing the Bar&rsquo;s Simple Remedies Outline early in their law school career.]</p>

<p><strong>Invasion of Privacy</strong></p>
<p><strong>ELLEN v. INKWIRE </strong></p>
<p><strong>1) FALSE LIGHT?</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law FALSE LIGHT is the intentional act of publishing a false portrayal of the plaintiff in a manner causing ridicule or embarrassment.</p>
<p>Here Inkwire published a portrayal about Ellen because it &quot;reported she was a secret philanthropist.&quot; This was a false portrayal because she was a &quot;tightwad.&quot; And this caused her embarrassment because she was &quot;besieged with requests&quot; that were &quot;professionally impossible&quot; to reject. Ellen's damages would generally be measured by the amount of embarrassment she was caused.</p>
<p>Therefore, Inkwire may be liable for invasion of privacy under a false light theory.</p>
<p><strong>2) INTRUSION?</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law INTRUSION is an unreasonable intrusion into the peace and solitude of the plaintiff. Damages are measured by the value of lost solitude to the plaintiff.<br />
    Here there was an unreasonable intrusion because Dick sent a &quot;submarine&quot; to photograph Ellen through a &quot;telephoto lens&quot;. It disturbed her peace and solitude because she had attempted to be alone in a secluded place &quot;miles&quot; from shore with a &quot;posted lookout.&quot; Ellen suffered damages because it &quot;embarrassed her&quot; into &quot;seclusion&quot; in her home for &quot;six weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>Dick would argue that Ellen had no reasonable expectation of privacy because she was &quot;in international waters.&quot; Ellen would counter that she had a reasonable expectation of privacy because of the location and precautions she had taken.</p>
<p>Therefore, Inkwire may be liable for intrusion.</p>
<p><strong>3) APPROPRIATION OF LIKENESS?</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law APPROPRIATION is the unauthorized use of the name or likeness of a person in a manner that implies endorsement of a product or support of a cause, but not mere publication of names and photos as news articles. Damages are generally measured by the profit to the defendant.</p>
<p>Here there was a use of Ellen's photo and name because billboards with her &quot;picture&quot; said &quot;Ellen D. Generate&quot; buys their paper. And the use was not authorized because she did not give permission. The purpose of the billboards was to profit by implying she endorsed their paper.</p>
<p>Ellen's damages would generally be measured by the profits Inkwire made from using her likeness.</p>
<p><strong>4) PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF PRIVATE FACTS?</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law PUBLIC DISCLOSURE is the unreasonable public disclosure of private facts that a reasonable person would find embarrassing.</p>
<p>Here there was a public disclosure because Inkwire &quot;ran the interview&quot; in its publication. And the facts were private facts because they were told to the ex-boyfriend in &quot;strictest confidence.&quot; These were embarrassing facts because they concerned an &quot;abortion&quot;, a matter of personal intimacy, and of a nature likely to cause public disdain and ridicule. Ellen would argue Inkwire acted in an unreasonable manner.</p>
<p>Inkwire would argue that it acted reasonably because these facts were a matter of legitimate public concern since Ellen had injected herself into the public arena as a &quot;strong and vocal anti- abortion advocate.&quot; Inkwire would argue the public had a right to know Ellen's true background since she sought to influence public opinion on this controversial topic.</p>
<p>Therefore, Ellen might fail to show Inkwire acted unreasonably.</p>
