<br />
<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
<p>Let's say plaintiff name is Paula</p>
<p>Paula's cause of action here is for <strong>NEGLIGENCE</strong>. Under tort law <strong>NEGLIGENCE</strong> is the failure to exercise that degree of care that a reasonable prudent person would use in the same circumstances. To establish a prima facie case Paula must generally prove <strong>DUTY</strong>, <strong>BREACH</strong>, <strong>ACTUAL</strong> AND <strong>PROXIMATE</strong> <strong>CAUSATION</strong> AND <strong>DAMAGES</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Negligence Occurs in case of carelessness or accident. Five elements are present in case of negligence: 1. Defendant had a duty to act reasonable, 2. Defendant berached that duty, 3. Defendant's breach was actual cause of plaintiff's injury, 4. Defendant's breach was proximate cause of plaintiff's injury, 5. Damages are caused by defendant's breach. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Strict Liability</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law a defendant that engages in any of three activities is STRICTLY LIABLE to any person who is <strong>actually</strong> and <strong>proximately</strong> caused injury. These three activities are: 1) keeping a <strong>KNOWN, DANGEROUS ANIMAL</strong> , 2) keeping an <strong>EXOTIC ANIMAL</strong> of a type that is not commonly domesticated, or 3) engaging in <strong>ULTRA-HAZARDOUS ACTIVITIES</strong> that are unusual, pose extreme risks to others, and are usually subject to strict safety regulations. </p>
<p>If a defendant engages in these activities duty is presumed, and if anyone is caused injured as a result breach is presumed as well. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>1. DUTY?</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law the general rule is that a person has no duty to act to defend others from harm. A DUTY to act to protect others from harm ONLY arises under five scenarios: [SCRAP] STATUTE, CONTRACT, RELATIONSHIP, ASSUMPTION or where PERIL to the plaintiff is caused by the defendant.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Duty to act reasonably necessary to protect others from harm. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>NEGLIGENCE PER SE?</strong></p>
<p>Def 1 Essay: If a STATUTE creates a duty, violating the statute may constitute NEGLIGENCE PER SE if the purpose of the statute was to protect the CLASS OF PEOPLE to which plaintiff belongs, and the violation of the statute caused the plaintiff to suffer the TYPE OF INJURY the statute was intended to prevent. </p>
<p>Def 2: A defendant that 1) <strong>violates a STATUTE</strong> or rule <strong>causing injury</strong> to the plaintiff will be NEGLIGENT PER SE if 2) the statute was <strong>intended to protect people like the plaintiff</strong> from 3) <strong>injuries like those suffered</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1: </strong></p>
<p>Here Tom violated the law that prohibited fireworks in the National Forest, and that caused Paula to suffer injury. But she was not in the CLASS OF PEOPLE the statute was intended to protect because it was to protect people &quot;on national lands&quot; and she was &quot;outside the National Forest boundaries&quot;. Further she did not suffer the TYPE OF INJURY the statute was intended to prevent because it was to &quot;prevent forest fires and injury&quot;while her injury was getting wet and having her money stolen.</p>
<p>Therefore, Paula would be unable to prove Tom was negligent per se. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>DUTY BASED ON PERIL?</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law defendants that create <strong>reasonably foreseeable dangers</strong> to <strong>others</strong> have a DUTY based on PERIL to act reasonably to protect others from those dangers. </p>
<p>Under PALSGRAF, Cardozo said that a duty is only owed to those who are in the <strong>zone of danger</strong> caused by the defendant's acts. The Zone of Danger is the area where the defendant&rsquo;s acts create reasonably foreseeable peril to others. </p>
<p>Andrews held that if the defendant <strong>owes a duty to anyone</strong> and breaches it, he should be<strong> liable for all injury </strong>actually and proximately caused by that breach.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<p>Here the Zone of Danger was the gravel bar and the water area immediately around it because it was not reasonably foreseeable the firecrackers could cause peril to anyone outside that area. And there was nobody placed in danger within the zone of danger because &quot;no one else was around&quot; and there was &quot;nothing that could burn&quot;.</p>
<p>Paula appeared to be outside the zone of danger caused by Tom's activities because she was a &quot;half mile downstream&quot;. Paula might argue that the zone of danger was larger than the small area of the &quot;gravel bar&quot; because Tom should have seen the possibility injury could occur further away.</p>
<p>Therefore, it would be difficult for Paula to prove that Tom had any duty at all, and almost impossible for her to prove that she was placed in foreseeable peril by his actions.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<p>Here Dick could only have a duty based on PERIL, and there is little evidence Dick's act created reasonably foreseeable peril to anyone. The only foreseeable danger he caused by pushing the log in the river is that it might hit someone swimming in the river downstream. Therefore the &quot;zone of danger&quot; created by his act is the surface of the river downstream. There is no evidence anyone was in the river, and Paula was certainly not beacuse she was on the bridge.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no evidence Dick created any foreseeable peril to anyone, and if that could not be proven he did not owe Paula anyone else a duty.  </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>DUTY BASED ON PREMISES LIABILITY?</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law <strong>OCCUPIERS OF LAND</strong> have a duty to both those who come onto the land and to those off the land. This is a form of duty based on <strong>RELATIONSHIP</strong>.</p>
<p>Under the common law occupiers of land had <strong>no duty to UNKNOWN TRESPASSERS</strong>.</p>
<p>The occupiers had a duty to <strong>warn and protect</strong> <strong>KNOWN TRESPASSERS and LICENSEES</strong> from<strong> known, hidden dangers and artificial conditions</strong>. <strong>Licensees</strong> are people allowed onto the land but <strong>not for the occupiers&rsquo; benefit</strong>.</p>
<p>The occupiers had a duty to reasonably inspect the land and <strong>warn and protect</strong> <strong>INVITEES</strong> from <strong>known, hidden dangers and artificial conditions.</strong> <strong>Invitees</strong> are people invited or allowed onto the land for the <strong>occupiers&rsquo; benefit</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally the occupiers of land had a duty to conduct and control activities on the land with <strong>due care</strong> to <strong>prevent injury</strong> to <strong>PEOPLE OFF THE LAND</strong>.</p>
<p>Modernly these rigid rules by classification have often been modified by both statute and Court decision to create a balancing test under which occupiers of land have a duty of due care to ALL PEOPLE to act as <strong>reasonable people</strong> would in <strong>inspecting</strong>, <strong>maintaining</strong> and using their property so that it <strong>does not pose known dangers</strong> to others.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>ATTRACTIVE NUISANCE DOCTRINE?</strong></p>
<p>Under the <strong>ATTRACTIVE NUISANCE DOCTRINE</strong> an <strong>OCCUPIER OF LAND</strong> who knows that <strong>children</strong> have or may in the future <strong>trespassed</strong> onto her land has a <strong>strict duty to inspect for and eliminate</strong> any condition posing dangers the <strong>children</strong> might <strong>not fully appreciate</strong> because of their <strong>young age</strong>.</p>
<p>This is a duty based on <strong>RELATIONSHIP</strong> which poses almost strict liability. The only defense the landowner may raise is<strong> assumption of the risk</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The defendant would be liable for dangers caused by use of the &quot;attractive thing&quot; on his land if he knew or should have known that: (1) children came to his property when the defendant and his family were not home, (2) children played on the &quot;attractive thing&quot;, (3) use of the &quot;attractive thing&quot; would likely cause injury because the children would not realize the danger of using the &quot;attractive thing&quot;, and (4) the expense of remedying the situation was slight compared to the probability of injury.&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>LIABILITY BASED ON RESCUER DOCTRINE / FIREMAN&rsquo;S RULE?</strong></p>
<p>Under the RESCUER DOCTRINE defendants may be<strong> liable to rescuers</strong> who are injured attempting to rescue people injured.</p>
<p>But under the FIREMAN&rsquo;S RULE defendants are generally <strong>not liable to professional rescue workers</strong> because they have <strong>ASSUMED THE RISKS</strong> associated with their professions.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>2. BREACH AND STANDARD OF CARE?</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law a BREACH is the failure to exercise <strong>DUE CARE</strong>. The <strong>standard of due care</strong> is that level of caution a <strong>reasonably</strong> prudent person would use in the <strong>same</strong> circumstance. </p>
<p><strong>Example 1: </strong></p>
<p>Here Tom went to great lengths to be sure his activities did not endabger anyone because he went to a &quot;gravel bar&quot; in the middle of the river with no one around so there would be no foreseeable danger to anyone. And once there he threw the firecrackers &quot;carefully&quot;.</p>
<p>Paula could only argue that a reasonable observant person would have seen the &quot;log&quot; floating down the river, and would have been careful not to throw any burning firecrackers onto it.</p>
<p>Therefore, it would be difficult for the Paula to show that a reasonable person would have been any more careful than Tom. </p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<p>Breach was defined above. The STANDARD OF CARE for a child is to act in the manner reasonable children of the same age and experience act.</p>
<p>Here Dick was only &quot;three year old&quot; and he would only be negligent if he acted in a manner that children of that age do not reasonable act.</p>
<p>Since Dick was so young it is unlikely Paula could prove that he breached his duty, if he had a duty.   </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>RES IPSA LOQUITUR?</strong></p>
<p>Under the doctrine of RES IPSA LOQUITUR an INFERENCE OF BREACH exists if 1) negligence by someone is implied by the facts, 2) the defendant had control of the event or instrument that caused injury, and 3) the plaintiff had no control over the event or instrument causing injury.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1 Sample:</strong></p>
<p>Here <strong>negligence by someone is implied</strong> because&hellip; and the <strong>defendant had control over the event</strong> (or cause of injury) because&hellip; and the <strong>plaintiff had no control </strong>over the event (or cause of injury) because&hellip;</p>
<p>Therefore, BREACH could be inferred based on RES IPSA LOQUITUR. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>BREACH BASED ON NEGLIGENT ENTRUSTMENT?</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law defendants who NEGLIGENTLY ENTRUST third parties with resources or authority are <strong>directly liable</strong> for injuries actually and proximately caused as a result.</p>
<p>[This is the intended issue when a defendant negligently gives or loans someone else an object (e.g. a car to a drunk driver) or otherwise puts them in a position where they have the power and ability to hurt the plaintiff. If the defendant SELLS the object to the other person (e.g. sells a car to a known alcoholic) the law is far less likely to find the defendant liable.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>3. ACTUAL CAUSE of injury?</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law the defendant is the ACTUAL CAUSE of injury if the plaintiff would not have been injured BUT FOR the acts of the defendant.</p>
<p>If two or more defendants acted negligently, the plaintiff would not have been injured if neither had acted, and the plaintiff cannot reasonably prove she would not have been injured but for the acts of each alone, then each defendant is a SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR causing injury.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<p>Here Paula would not have fallen in the river and had her money stolen if Tom had not thrown the firecracker.</p>
<p>Therefore, Tom was the actual cause of Paula's injury.   </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>4. PROXIMATE CAUSE?</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law PROXIMATE CAUSE means that the injury suffered by the plaintiff was so DIRECT, NATURAL and FORESEEABLE, so close in time and place, resulting from a CHAIN OF CAUSATION begun by the defendant&rsquo;s acts, unbroken by UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENTS that the law will impose liability for the result.</p>
<p>Generally if two or more events are actual causes of the plaintiff&rsquo;s injury, the last event will be an UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENT cutting off the liability of all defendants who acted earlier. However, it is a matter of settled law that negligent acts by others are FORESEEABLE so they can never be intervening events. Acts of nature [e.g. tornados] and criminal or intentionally tortious acts by third parties [e.g. thefts, batteries] are presumed to be UNFORESEEABLE and will terminate defendants&rsquo; liability unless extrinsic evidence shows defendants were aware the subsequent events were likely to occur.</p>
<p><strong>Definition in Exam: </strong></p>
<p>Under tort law, PROXIMATE CAUSE means that the injury to the plaintiff was so <strong>foreseeable, close in time and place</strong> to the acts of the defendant and a <strong>direct result </strong>of a <strong>chain of causation unbroken by unforeseeable intervening events</strong>.</p>
<p>Generally where there are two or more actual causes of an injury, the <strong>last, unforeseeable, intentional act</strong> will be an UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENT that becomes the sole proximate cause, cutting off all the liablities arising from the prior acts. Further, criminal acts and intentional torts by third parties are<strong> presumed to be unforeseeable </strong>absent additional facts. </p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<p>Here Paula was rather far away from Tom in time and space, and it would not be foreseeable she could be injured by a firecraker at that distance. Further a reasonable person could not foresee that a firecracker could cause money to be stolen. Finally, even if Tom was the proximate cause of Paula failing in the river, he was not the proximate cause of her money being stolen because Harry's criminal act was an <strong>unforeseeable intervening event</strong>. </p>
<p>Therefore, Paula probably could not prove Tom was the proximate cause of her fall into the river, and she certainly could not prove he was the proximate cause of her money being taken. </p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<p>Here Dick was even farther away from Paula than Tom, and it was even more unforeseeable that his act could harm her or anyone else.</p>
<p>Therefore, Paula would have even a more difficult time proving Dick was the cause of her injury.  </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>5. DAMAGES?</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law DAMAGES are SPECIAL (out of pocket expense) and GENERAL (pain and suffering). </p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<p>Here Paula had SPECIAL damages because she lost &quot;two dollars&quot; and she had GENERAL damages because she was &quot;hurt and upset&quot;. But she got out of the river &quot;laughingly&quot; and was not &quot;hurt and upset&quot; until after she discovered the purse was stolen.</p>
<p>Therefore, Paula suffered actual damages, but Tom was not the cause of those damages. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>NEGLIGENT INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS?</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law, a BYSTANDER to an event may bring an action for NEGLIGENT INFLICTION if they suffer severe emotional distress and there is a nexus between the negligent act and the injury based on a PROXIMITY IN TIME, PLACE and RELATIONSHIP. In some jurisdictions a physical manifestation of emotional distress must be shown. </p>
<p>Do not discuss NIED unless the plaintiff is a BYSTANDER who only witnesses or hears about some accident that injures another person. If the plaintiff is actually, physically involved in an event they have an action for NEGLIGENCE and can recover for their &ldquo;emotional distress&rdquo; as special damages.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>VICARIOUS LIABILITY BASED ON RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR ?</strong></p>
<p>Under the doctrine of RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR an employer, master or principal is vicariously liable for all torts committed by an employee, servant or agent, respectively, if the tort is committed within the scope of the employment or agency relationship. </p>
<p>Respondeat superior does not apply to independent contractors.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>VICARIOUS LIABILITY for JOINT ENTERPRISE ?</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law each member of a JOINT ENTERPRISE is vicariously liable for all torts committed by other members within the scope of the enterprise relationship. A joint enterprise is one in which two or more parties agree to work together for mutual benefit and each shares equal rights of control over assets and activities. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>VICARIOUS LIABILITY for acts of INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR?</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law prople who hire INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS to perform duties that are not &ldquo;non-delegable&rdquo; by law are NOT vicariously liable for torts committed by the contractors and can only be directly liable because of negligent selection or negligent entrustment of the contractors. An independent contractor is a person selected to provide labor services without close and regular supervision [e.g. gardeners, housekeepers, house painters and babysitters that are not employed on an exclusive and continuous basis.]</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>6. CONTRIBUTORY or COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE?</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE is a complete bar to recovery if the plaintiff was responsible in any manner for their injury. It is a MINORITY VIEW rule, and the MAJORITY approach is COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE which just reduces the plaintiff&rsquo;s recovery based on the degree of fault of the plaintiff. In some states a plaintiff that is over 50% at fault for her own injuries is completely barred from recovery.</p>
<p>The Last Clear Chance Doctrine held that contributory negligence by a plaintiff was NOT a complete bar to recovery if the defendant had a last clear chance to avoid the accident that injured the plaintiff and failed to do so. </p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<p>Negligence Per Se is defined above. Tom might argue Paula was NEGLIGENT PER SE because she was fishing on the bridge where that is prohibited by Statute. But Paula did not suffer the TYPE OF INJURY the statute was to prevent. The purpose of the statute was &quot;traffic safety&quot; and she was not injured in a traffic accident. </p>
<p>Therefore any &quot;negligence per se&quot; argument by Tom would fail.</p>
<p>Tom's better argument is that Paula was contributory (comparatively) negligent because she sat &quot;carelessly&quot;  and that placed her in PERIL of falling.</p>
<p>Therefore, Tom could easily prove Paula was &quot;careless&quot; and partly responsible for her own injury. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>EGG-SHELL PLAINTIFF?</strong></p>
<p>Under the EGG-SHELL PLAINTIFF concept, defendants are liable for all damages they actually cause plaintiffs, even if the plaintiffs , through no fault of their own, have pre-existing conditions that make them especially vulnerable to injury. The doctrine of the law is that &ldquo;defendants must take plaintiffs as they find them.&rdquo; </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>7. ASSUMPTION OF RISK?</strong><br />
    Under tort law ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK is  a complete bar to recovery for negligence if 1) plaintiffs deliberately <strong>put themselves at risk</strong> 2) with <strong>full awareness</strong> of the risks and 3) a <strong>conscious acceptance</strong> of the risks.</p>
<p>[Note: Assumption of the risk is the only possible affirmative defense to a proven claim of <strong>Strict Liability</strong>  or <strong>Attractive Nuisance Doctrine</strong> .]</p>
<p><strong>Example 1: </strong></p>
<p>Here Paula put <strong>herself at risk</strong> because she &quot;sat carelessly&quot;. She had a <strong>full awareness</strong> of the risks that she could fall. And she appears to have <strong>consciously accepted</strong> those risks because the river was only a few &quot;feet&quot; below her, &quot;she could swim&quot; and it was a &quot;nice day&quot;.</p>
<p>Therefore, Tom may be able to prove assumptions of risks. </p>
<p><strong>Example 2 (Oct 2016): </strong></p>
<p>Here Moe put <strong>herself at risk</strong> because Moe comes into Barry&rsquo;s shop to get a shave. He had a <strong>full awareness</strong> of the risks that he would be cut by Barry during a shave with a straight razor. And he appears to have <strong>consciously accepted</strong> those risks because he voluntarily entered Barry's shop for a shave and consented to the activity.</p>
<p>Therefore, Barry may be able to prove assumptions of risks. </p>
<hr />
<p><br />
    <strong>Practice Question 2</strong><br />
    Tom bought some firecrackers in Rural County, where they were legal. He took them into the National Forest where federal law prohibited the possession and use of fireworks. The federal law was enacted to reduce the threat of forest fires and injury on national lands.<br />
    In the National Forest Tom waded to a gravel bar in the middle of Big River, and there he carefully lit and threw the firecrackers into the air above the river. Occasionally one would fail to explode and it would fall harmlessly into the water. There was no one else around, and there was nothing on the gravel bar that could burn.<br />
    Little Dick was playing a half-mile upstream from Tom, throwing sticks into Big River. He was three years old. His mother warned him to stay back from the edge of the river because it was dangerous. Dick disobeyed his mother and recklessly pushed a rotted tree into the river and it swirled away in the water. No one was hurt.<br />
    Half a mile downstream from Tom, Paula was one of five people on the bridge above Big River fishing for trout. Paula was outside the National Forest boundaries. She had ignored a sign that said &quot;No Fishing From Bridge.&quot; Fishing from the bridge was prohibited for traffic safety, but she was well off the roadway and there were very few cars this time of year. Paula was sitting carelessly on the edge of the bridge, but it was a nice day, the water was only six feet below her, and she knew how to swim.<br />
    Tom threw another firecracker into the air and it did not explode. Instead it fell onto the log that Dick had pushed into the river upstream.<br />
    The log swept down the river for half a mile before the firecracker exploded just as the log swept under the bridge.<br />
    Paula was startled and fell into the river.<br />
    Other people that had been fishing rushed off the bridge and down the river bank to rescue Paula as she laughingly climbed up the bank.<br />
    Harry had been fishing too, but instead of going to help Paula, he stayed on the bridge and took two dollars out of Paula's purse. No one saw Harry take the money and the crime was never solved. Paula was hurt and upset.<br />
Under what theories can Paula seek to recover from Tom and Dick and what defenses would they raise?</p>
<p>[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This question focuses on the outer limits of DUTY to a remotely situated plaintiff (with firecracker yet, a la Palsgraf) and PROXIMATE CAUSATION of damage by some burning object floating down a river (a la Wagon Mound I and II). The question also focuses on the outer limits of BREACH because one cannot be breaching a duty by an act that poses no foreseeable risk to others.<br />
    Law schools tend to brainwash every student into thinking they can always sue, and win, for every injury. The truth is that Paula&rsquo;s case is frivolous. ]<br />
</p>
<p>Sample Answer 16-2: Negligence<br />
    PAULA V. TOM<br />
    NEGLIGENCE?<br />
    Paula&rsquo;s only cause of action here is for NEGLIGENCE. Under tort law NEGLIGENCE is the failure to exercise that degree of care that a reasonably prudent person would use in the same circumstances. To establish a prima facie case Paula must generally prove DUTY, BREACH, ACTUAL AND PROXIMATE CAUSATION and DAMAGES.<br />
    1) DUTY?<br />
    Generally a person owes no duty to others. But a duty may be based on a STATUTE, a CONTRACT, a RELATIONSHIP, the ASSUMPTION of a duty, or PERIL caused by the defendant.<br />
    NEGLIGENCE PER SE?<br />
    If a STATUTE creates a duty, violating the statute may constitute NEGLIGENCE PER SE if the purpose of the statute was to protect the CLASS OF PEOPLE to which the plaintiff belongs, and the violation of the statute caused the plaintiff to suffer the TYPE OF INJURY the statute was intended to prevent.<br />
    Here Tom violated the law that prohibited fireworks in the National Forest, and that caused Paula to suffer injury. But she was not in the CLASS OF PEOPLE the statute was intended to protect because it was to protect people &ldquo;on national lands&rdquo; and she was &ldquo;outside the National Forest boundaries&rdquo;. Further, she did not suffer the TYPE OF INJURY the statute was intended to prevent because it was to &ldquo;prevent forest fires and injury&rdquo; while her injury was getting wet and having her money stolen.<br />
    Therefore, Paula would be unable to prove Tom was negligent per se.<br />
    DUTY BASED ON PERIL?<br />
    Under PALSGRAF, Cardozo said that a duty is only owed to those who are in the zone of danger caused by the defendant's acts. The Zone of Danger is the area where the defendant&rsquo;s acts create reasonably foreseeable peril to others.<br />
    Andrews held that if the defendant owes a duty to anyone and breaches it, he should be liable for all injury actually and proximately caused by that breach.<br />
    Here the Zone of Danger was the gravel bar and the water area immediately around it because it was not reasonably foreseeable the firecrackers could cause peril to anyone outside that area. And there was nobody placed in danger within the zone of danger because &ldquo;no one else was around&rdquo; and there was &ldquo;nothing that could burn&rdquo;.<br />
    Paula appeared to be outside the zone of danger caused by Tom's activities because she was a &quot;half mile downstream.&quot; Paula might argue that the zone of danger was larger than the small area of the &ldquo;gravel bar&rdquo; because Tom should have seen the possibility injury could occur farther away.<br />
    Therefore, it would be difficult for Paula to prove that Tom had any duty at all, and almost impossible for her to prove that she was placed in foreseeable peril by his actions.<br />
    2) BREACH?<br />
    Under tort law a BREACH is the failure to exercise DUE CARE. The standard of due care is that level of caution a reasonably prudent person would use in the same circumstance.<br />
    Here Tom went to great lengths to be sure his activities did not endanger anyone because he went to a &quot;gravel bar&quot; in the &quot;middle of the river&quot; with no one around so there would be no foreseeable danger to anyone. And once there he threw the firecrackers &ldquo;carefully&rdquo;.<br />
    Paula could only argue that a reasonably observant person would have seen the &ldquo;log&rdquo; floating down the river, and would have been careful not to throw any burning firecrackers onto it.<br />
    Therefore, it would be difficult for Paula to show that a reasonable person would have been any more careful than Tom.<br />
    3) ACTUAL CAUSE of injury to Paula?<br />
    Under tort law an act ACTUALLY CAUSES injury if the plaintiff would not have been injured but for the act.<br />
    Here Paula would not have fallen in the river and had her money stolen if Tom had not thrown the firecracker.<br />
    Therefore, Tom was the actual cause of Paula's injury.<br />
    4) PROXIMATE CAUSE of injury to Paula?<br />
    Under tort law PROXIMATE CAUSE means that the injury to the plaintiff was foreseeable, close in time and place to the acts of the defendant and a direct result of a chain of causation unbroken by unforeseeable intervening events.<br />
    Generally when there are two or more actual causes of an injury, the last, unforeseeable,<br />
    intentional act will be an UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENT that becomes the sole proximate cause, cutting off all liability arising from prior acts. Further, criminal acts and intentional torts by third parties are presumed to be unforeseeable absent additional specific facts.<br />
    Here Paula was rather far away from Tom in time and space, and it would not be foreseeable she could be injured by a firecracker at that distance. Further a reasonable person could not foresee that a firecracker would cause money to be stolen. Finally, even if Tom was the proximate cause of Paula falling in the river, he was not the proximate cause of her money being stolen because Harry&rsquo;s criminal act was an unforeseeable intervening event.<br />
    Therefore, Paula probably could not prove Tom was the proximate cause of her fall into the river, and she certainly could not prove he was the proximate cause of her money being taken.<br />
</p>
<p>5) DAMAGES?<br />
    Under tort law DAMAGES are SPECIAL (out of pocket expense) and GENERAL (pain and suffering).<br />
    Here Paula had SPECIAL damages because she lost &quot;two dollars&quot; and she had GENERAL damages because she was &quot;hurt and upset.&quot; But she got out of the river &ldquo;laughingly&rdquo; and was not &ldquo;hurt and upset&rdquo; until after she discovered the purse was stolen.<br />
    Therefore Paula suffered actual damages, but Tom was not the cause of those damages. 6) CONTRIBUTORY or COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE?<br />
    Under tort law CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE is a complete bar to recovery if the plaintiff was responsible in any manner for their injury. It is a MINORITY VIEW rule, and the MAJORITY approach is COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE which just reduces the plaintiff&rsquo;s recovery based on the degree of fault of the plaintiff. In some states a plaintiff that is over 50% at fault for her own injuries is completely barred from recovery.<br />
    NEGLIGENCE PER SE is defined above. Tom might argue Paula was NEGLIGENT PER SE because she was fishing on the bridge where that is prohibited by statute. But Paula did not suffer the TYPE OF INJURY the statute was to prevent/ The purpose of the statute was &ldquo;traffic safety&rdquo; and she was not injured in a traffic accident.<br />
    Therefore any &ldquo;negligence per se&rdquo; argument by Tom would fail.<br />
    Tom&rsquo;s better argument is that Paula was contributorily (comparatively) negligent because she sat &ldquo;carelessly&rdquo; and that placed her in PERIL of falling.<br />
    Therefore, Tom could easily prove Paula was &ldquo;careless&rdquo; and partly responsible for her own injury.<br />
    7) ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK?<br />
    Under tort law ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK is a complete defense when plaintiffs 1) put<br />
    themselves at risk, 2) with a full awareness of the risks, and 3) a conscious acceptance of the risks.<br />
    Here Paula put herself at risk because she &ldquo;sat carelessly&rdquo;. She had a full awareness of the risks that she could fall. And she appears to have consciously accepted those risks because the river was only a few &ldquo;feet&rdquo; below her, &ldquo;she could swim&rdquo; and it was a &ldquo;nice day&rdquo;.<br />
    Therefore Tom may be able to prove assumption of the risks.</p>
<p>Negligence is defined above.<br />
    8) DUTY?<br />
    Duty was defined above. Here Dick could only have a duty based on PERIL, and there is little evidence Dick&rsquo;s act created reasonably foreseeable peril to anyone. The only foreseeable danger he caused by pushing the log in the river is that it might hit someone swimming in the river downstream. Therefore the &ldquo;zone of danger&rdquo; created by his act is the surface of the river downstream. There is no evidence anyone was in the river, and Paula was certainly not because she was on the bridge..<br />
    Therefore, there is no evidence Dick created any foreseeable peril to anyone, and if that could not be proven he did not owe Paula or anyone else a duty.<br />
    9) BREACH AND STANDARD OF CARE?<br />
    Breach was defined above. The STANDARD OF CARE for a child is to act in the manner reasonable children of the same age and experience act.<br />
    Here Dick was only &ldquo;three years old&rdquo; and he would only be negligent if he acted in a manner that children of that age do not reasonably act.<br />
    Since Dick was so young it is unlikely Paula could prove that he breached his duty, if he had a duty.<br />
    10) PROXIMATE CAUSE? Proximate cause is defined above.<br />
    Here Dick was even farther away from Paula than Tom, and it was even more unforeseeable that his act could harm her or anyone else.<br />
    Therefore, Paula would have even a more difficult time proving Dick was the cause of her injury.</p>

<p>Class #9 Hypo<br />
    <br />
    Dick was a motorcycle messenger for Couriers, a courier service in Newtown. On  the job Dick drives a new &ldquo;Hondo&rdquo; motorcycle Couriers recently purchased from  Dealer. In the sales contract the manufacturer, Hondoco, expressly warranted  the product free from defects but disclaimed liability for any consequential  losses that might result from a defect in the product. </p>
<p>While there was no  state statute, Couriers had a rule that Dick must wear a helmet when riding the  motorcycle. He often failed to comply, and Couriers was unaware of this because  Dick would drive away with his helmet on and then take it off. </p>
<p>On Monday Dick left to  make an urgent delivery of important documents on the other side of Newtown.  Soon he discovered the new Hondo had a slow gasoline leak, and the fuel all  drained out onto the street. It took an hour to repair the leak and get new  fuel. </p>
<p>Because he was late  Dick took a different route across town without wearing his helmet. As he went  under an overpass a bottle thrown from above hit him on the head, seriously  injuring him, and he fell off the motorcycle. </p>
<p>The Hondo continued  speeding down the street without a rider and seriously injured a pedestrian,  Paul. Paul had seen the motorcycle coming at him but raced across the street in  front of it anyway because he was trying to catch his regular bus. </p>
<p>Couriers lost its  account because the documents Dick was carrying failed to be delivered that  day. Hondoco agreed to replace the motorcycle but refused to compensate  Couriers for the lost account. Prior to Dick&rsquo;s accident Hondoco had discovered  that many other Hondo&rsquo;s had experienced the same fuel leak problem. </p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  On what theory or  theories, if any, may Paul sue to recover damages from Dick and Couriers, and  what defenses might Dick and Couriers assert? Discuss. </p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  On what theory or  theories, if any, may Dick sue to recover damages from Hondoco? Discuss. </p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  May Couriers recover  damages from Hondo Co on any of the theories asserted by Dick against Hondo co?  Discuss.</p>

<p><br />
Class #9 Sample Answer</p>
<p>P v. D</p>
<p>Negligence?</p>
<p>Under tort law negligence is the failure to act as a reasonable person would in the same situation. To prevail plaintiffs must prove the defendants BREACHED a DUTY, and that the breach was the ACTUAL and PROXIMATE cause of the plaintiffs&rsquo; INJURY.</p>
<p>Duty? There is no &ldquo;general duty&rdquo; to act to protect others, but a duty can be created by a Statute, by a Contract, by a Relationship, by Assumption or by acts of the defendant that create Peril.</p>
<p>D ASSUMED a duty to wear a helmet when he went to work for C and agreed to wear a helmet as part of the job.</p>
<p>D also had a duty to drive carefully because he created PERIL to others when he drove a motorcycle. That duty was to drive carefully to protect other people from injury.</p>
<p>Breach? D clearly BREACHED his duty to wear a helmet because he was not wearing it at the time of the accident. </p>
<p>P would argue that D&rsquo;s failure to wear the helmet was &ldquo;careless driving&rdquo; that caused the accident so D should be liable to P for his injuries. D would argue that the purpose of the company rule was to protect D from injury, not other people like P, so his breach of the company rule should not make him liable to anybody except C.</p>
<p>P can prove D breached his duty to wear a helmet, and he might be able to persuade the court that was &ldquo;careless driving&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Actual Cause? P has the burden of proving the breach by D (not wearing a helmet) was the actual cause of his injury. A breach of duty is an actual cause of injury if the injury would not have occurred BUT FOR the breach. </p>
<p>Here the accident was caused by a &ldquo;bottle&rdquo; hitting D on the head, seriously injured him, and knocking him off the motorcycle.</p>
<p>P cannot prove D would not have fallen from the motorcycle BUT FOR the fact he failed to wear a helmet. </p>
<p>P can &ldquo;argue&rdquo; D would not have fallen if he were wearing a helmet, but then D can just as easily deny it. </p>
<p>Without facts P cannot prove actual causation.</p>
<p>Proximate Cause? P has a burden of proving the breach by D (not wearing a helmet) was the direct and foreseeable cause of his injury by a string of events unbroken by unforeseeable intervening events.</p>
<p>Negligence by other people is, by law, considered to be foreseeable. But intentional torts and crimes committed by other people is, by law, unforeseeable absent knowledge that they are likely to occur. </p>
<p>Here someone &ldquo;threw a bottle&rdquo; at D, and that was an actual cause of the accident since D would not have had the accident BUT FOR that bottle being thrown.</p>
<p>So if that bottle was thrown at D deliberately, it was an unforeseeable intervening event that cut off any liability D might have had. On the other hand, if the bottle was thrown &ldquo;negligently&rdquo;  and just hit D by accident, then it was not an unforeseeable intervening event.</p>
<p>The burden is on P to prove proximate causation, so P must prove the bottle was not thrown deliberately. Absent facts to prove that, P cannot prove proximate causation.</p>
<p>Therefore, P can prove D breached a duty to wear a helmet but he cannot prove that breach caused his injury.</p>
<p>Assumption of the Risk?</p>
<p>Assumption of the risk is a complete defense if the defendant can prove the plaintiff was aware of the dangers that caused injury and consciously assumed the risks of those dangers.</p>
<p>Here P saw the motorcycle &ldquo;coming at him&rdquo; but ran into the street in front of it anyway because he was trying to catch a bus. </p>
<p>Therefore, D can prove P assumed the risks that caused his injury.</p>
<p>Contributory / Comparative Negligence?</p>
<p>Contributory negligence means that a plaintiff acted negligently and that was a cause of some of the plaintiff&rsquo;s injury. It is a complete defense in some jurisdictions. </p>
<p>Comparative negligence is an alternative approach in other jurisdictions. It means that negligence by the plaintiff is a partial defense and liability of the defendant will be reduced to the extent the plaintiff shares some of the blame for an accident.</p>
<p>If D cannot prove that P assumed the risks of injury because he did not fully appreciate the risk he was taking rushing across the street, he can still prove that P was negligent for running in front of the motorcycle.</p>
<p>Therefore, D can prove P was negligent and caused some of his own injury.</p>
<p>P v. H</p>
<p>Respondeat Superior?</p>
<p>Under the doctrine of respondeat superior an employer is liable for the actions of its employees if they are done within the scope of their employment.</p>
<p>P would argue D was driving the motorcycle within the scope of his employment so H should be liable for P&rsquo;s injury to the extent D is liable to P.</p>
<p>C might argue that D was on a DETOUR AND FROLIC at the time of the accident because he was driving on a &ldquo;different route&rdquo; and not wearing the helmet he was supposed to be wearing. </p>
<p>C would argue it should not be liable since D was on a &ldquo;frolic&rdquo; by not wearing the helmet and C was &ldquo;unaware&rdquo; he was doing that.</p>
<p>Negligent Supervision?</p>
<p>P could claim C created PERIL to others by hiring D and entrusting him with a motorcycle, so it had a DUTY to supervise D to be sure he was driving carefully.</p>
<p>P would say C BREACHED its duty because D &ldquo;often failed to comply&rdquo; with the company rule regarding helmets, and C should have discovered that. </p>
<p>Therefore, even if D was on a &ldquo;frolic&rdquo;, C was negligent in not monitoring D more carefully.</p>
<p>D v. H</p>
<p>Product Liability?</p>
<p>Any person who releases an unreasonably dangerous product into the stream of commerce may be liable for the injury caused by the dangers when the product is being used as intended or as would be reasonably foreseeable.</p>
<p>Product liability actions may be based on theories of negligence, battery, breach of express or implied warranty, or strict liability.</p>
<p>Here there is no evidence the &ldquo;gasoline leak&rdquo; of the motorcycle presented any dangers to anyone. The motorcycle was fixed before the accident, anyway, so the &ldquo;leak&rdquo; was not the cause of the accident.</p>
<p>Therefore D has no product liability case against H.</p>
<p>Breach of contract / Third Party Beneficiary?</p>
<p>C and H had a contract, and H breached the contract because it promised the motorcycle was free from defects when it really had a &ldquo;leak&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But D lacks standing to sue H based on breach of contract because he was not a party to the contract between H and C, and he was not an intended third party beneficiary of that contract.</p>
<p>C v. H based on theories put forth by D</p>
<p>Product Liability?</p>
<p>As set forth above, D has no product liability claim against H, so neither would C.</p>
<p>Breach of Contract?</p>
<p>C and H had a contract and H was in breach of the contract because it expressly warranted the motorcycle to be free from defects.</p>
<p>But the injury claimed by C is a consequential loss, the loss of an &ldquo;account&rdquo;, and the contract disclaimed any liability of H for consequential losses.</p>
<p>Therefore C cannot recover from H for its &ldquo;lost account&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Notes for Class #9 </p>
<p>This is an actual Bar question from some years ago.<br />
    Note it is a STRUCTURED CALL.<br />
    Label your answer with Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3 to show the Reader your answer is responsive to what the CALL is asking for.<br />
    But as you will see there is very little to say on Parts 2 and 3 and almost all of your time should be spent on Part 1.<br />
    &mdash;&mdash;<br />
    Part 1 - Break it down into two parts. First, PAUL (P) v. DICK (D). Then after that address P v. COURIERS (C).<br />
    Obviously, P&rsquo;s only cause of action against D is NEGLIGENCE. <br />
    I have been testing 1L students with this question for years, and I have never seen a student get it right.<br />
    First, define negligence as a general rule - &ldquo;Under tort law negligence is a failure to act as a reasonable person would act.&rdquo;<br />
    Negligence, itself, is not a tort. For plaintiffs to prove negligence has been tortious, they must prove some other things.<br />
    Then go on to name the ELEMENTS the plaintiff must prove in order to succeed in a negligence action - <br />
    DUTY<br />
    BREACH<br />
    CAUSATION<br />
    INJURY <br />
    Of these three, INJURY is easy to prove. Clearly P was injured.<br />
    The other three are very tricky, and that is what trips students up.<br />
    DUTY? This becomes an &ldquo;issue&rdquo; in its own right. State a rule and do analysis.<br />
    First big mistake is that many law students believe, and say,<br />
    &ldquo;People have a general duty to act so that other people are not subjected to danger&rdquo;.<br />
    This idea is TOTALLY WRONG! There is NO &ldquo;general duty&rdquo;.<br />
    Here is the correct RULE of tort law: <br />
    &ldquo;Generally people do not have a duty to act to protect other people from danger. People only have duty to act to protect other people from danger if it is created by a Statute, by a Contract, by a Relationship recognized by law, by their Assumption of the duty, or by their acts that create Peril to others or to themselves. (SCRAP!)&rdquo;<br />
    &mdash;-<br />
    STATUTORY DUTIES<br />
    It is common for laws to require people to act to protect themselves and others. <br />
    For example, you are required, by law, to wear a seatbelt when driving a car. Who is that supposed to protect? YOU.<br />
    For example, when you are driving a car you are required, by law, to make sure the passengers in the car are wearing seat belts. Who is that supposed to protect? The passengers.<br />
    When a duty created by a Statute is breached, it is called NEGLIGENCE PER SE. By &ldquo;Statute&rdquo; we mean LAW of some governmental agency.<br />
    But if a statutory duty is breached, the defendant is ONLY LIABLE to <br />
    The class of people the statute was intended to protect, and <br />
    Only for the type of injury the statute was intended to prevent.<br />
    For example, D is driving his car. Suddenly another car negligently runs into D. He flies out the window of his car because he was not wearing his seatbelt, in violation of the law. D lands on a child, P, who was walking on the sidewalk. P is badly injured. <br />
    D is NOT LIABLE to P because the statute that required him to wear a seatbelt was NOT INTENDED to protect pedestrians from bodies flying out of the cars in accidents!<br />
    There are TWO EXCEPTIONS to this rule, the RESCUER DOCTRINE and WRONGFUL DEATH. Those will be discussed later.<br />
    Here in this Hypo there is no law that says D has to wear a helmet.<br />
    &mdash;&mdash;<br />
    CONTRACTUAL DUTIES<br />
    A duty to act can be created by entering into a Contract.<br />
    For example, P has surgery on her leg, and she hires a nurse, D, to provide personal care for her. D has a duty to act to protect P from danger, because she agreed to do that in the contract, and she is getting paid for it.<br />
    But if a contractual duty is breached, the defendant is ONLY LIABLE to <br />
    The people the contract was intended to protect, and <br />
    Only for the type of injury the contract was intended to prevent.<br />
    Here again, there are TWO EXCEPTIONS to this rule, the RESCUER DOCTRINE and WRONGFUL DEATH. Those will be discussed later.<br />
    Here there are no facts to show D and C had an employment contract that required him to wear a helmet.<br />
    &mdash;-<br />
    ASSUMED DUTIES<br />
    A duty to act can be created by Assumption of the duty.<br />
    For example, P has surgery on her leg, and her friend, D, volunteers to provide personal care for her. D has a duty to act to protect P from danger, because she agreed to do that. She is not getting paid for it, but since she VOLUNTEERED to help P, she ASSUMED A DUTY to act to protect P.<br />
    For example, P and D go backpacking together. They don&rsquo;t discuss what might happen if one of them gets hurt. P falls and breaks his leg. D has a duty to go get help for P. Why? After all, he did not volunteer to protect P. But when they went backpacking together they entered into a JOINT VENTURE and each implicitly ASSUMED A DUTY to act to protect each other.<br />
    But if an assumed duty is breached, the defendant is ONLY LIABLE to <br />
    The people the defendant assumed a duty to protect (expressly or impliedly), and <br />
    Only for the type of injury the defendant assumed a duty to prevent.<br />
    For example, D goes to work for C as a motorcycle courier. The company has a rule that D must wear a helmet. Why? Because C does not want to be liable for injuries D might suffer if he was in an accident. D has ASSUMED a duty to wear a helmet. If he breaches the duty who is he liable to, and for what is he liable? He is liable to C for the costs it is going to incur if he is injured on the job.<br />
    Of course, C is never going to be able to collect from D if he gets injured, but his breach of the duty gives them cause to fire him.<br />
    Here again, there are TWO EXCEPTIONS to this rule, the RESCUER DOCTRINE and WRONGFUL DEATH. Those will be discussed later.<br />
    Here in our Hypo D clearly assumed a duty to wear a helmet because he took a job that required it.<br />
    So D had an assumed duty. To whom did he owe that duty? What was the purpose of the duty? To whom did it make him liable if he breached that duty?<br />
    &mdash;-<br />
    RELATIONSHIP DUTIES<br />
    A duty to act can be created by Relationships recognized by LAW. And by this we mean &ldquo;common law&rdquo;.<br />
    For example, P is a passenger on a cruise ship. D is the captain. D has a duty to act to protect P from danger, like from pirates, because ship captains, under the common law, have a duty to protect the passengers from dangers.<br />
    For example, D is a hotel manager, and P is a guest at the hotel. D has a duty to act to protect P from danger, like fire, because &ldquo;inn keepers&rdquo;, under the common law, have a duty to protect the guests from dangers.<br />
    But if a duty based on relationship is breached, the defendant is ONLY LIABLE to <br />
    The people the common law was intended to protect, and <br />
    Only for the type of injury the common law duty was intended to prevent.<br />
    Here again, there are TWO EXCEPTIONS to this rule, the RESCUER DOCTRINE and WRONGFUL DEATH. Those will be discussed later.<br />
    Here in the Hypo there is no relationship duty.<br />
    &mdash;-<br />
    DUTIES BASED ON PERIL<br />
    If a person acts in some way that creates REASONABLY FORESEEABLE PERIL to themselves or others, they have a duty to act reasonably to PROTECT themselves and others from that peril that they created.<br />
    For example, D driving his car. That creates reasonably foreseeable peril (danger, risks, etc.) to himself and others. Therefore he has a duty to act reasonably to protect himself and others from the dangers his<br />
    But if a duty based on peril is breached, the defendant&rsquo;s liability is subject to a lot of legal debate. <br />
    This is what Palsgraf was all about, the debate over the extent of liability for damages caused by perils created by the defendant.<br />
    Cardozo argued the defendant SHOULD ONLY BE LIABLE to <br />
    The people in the ZONE OF DANGER at the time the defendant created peril and then failed to protect others from that peril.<br />
    Andrews argued the defendant SHOULD BE LIABLE to <br />
    Everyone who was caused injury by the failure of the defendant to protect others from the dangers he created.<br />
    While Cardozo&rsquo;s opinion was adopted by the New York courts (about 100 years ago), modernly the Andrews view is most likely to prevail in most negligence actions.<br />
    Even if the Cardozo approach is followed, there are TWO EXCEPTIONS to this rule, the RESCUER DOCTRINE and WRONGFUL DEATH. Those will be discussed next.<br />
    Here in our Hypo D creates peril by operating a motor vehicle. That creates foreseeable dangers to others. He has a duty. What is his duty and to whom does he owe it? To whom is he liable if he breaches his duty?<br />
    &mdash;-<br />
    RESCUER DOCTRINE<br />
    This is an exception to the SCRAP rules given above.<br />
    A person who is negligent IS LIABLE for the injuries incurred by RESCUERS who reasonably come to their aid.<br />
    The catch phrase is &ldquo;peril invites rescue&rdquo;.<br />
    And this is true even if the defendants were not in the &ldquo;zone of danger&rdquo; and were not the people who were intended to be protected by some contract, statute, etc. that was breached.<br />
    For example, D goes backpacking by himself and negligently gets lost. Rescuers search for him, and in the process one of them, P, breaks his leg. D is liable to P for his injuries.<br />
    Obviously D only created dangers to himself by &ldquo;getting lost&rdquo;, and P was not in the &ldquo;zone of danger&rdquo; when D got lost. So D&rsquo;s act did not put anyone in danger except himself. But D is still liable to P.<br />
    BUT generally defendants are NOT LIABLE for injuries suffered by PROFESSIONAL RESCUERS like firemen. Why? First because &ldquo;professionals&rdquo; assume the risks of being injured by the typical dangers of their professions. Second, professional rescuers are insured for and compensated for the typical injuries their professions present.<br />
    This EXCEPTION is called the FIREMAN&rsquo;S RULE: <br />
    For example, D is in an auto accident. Fireman P strains his back as he is loading D into an ambulance. D is NOT liable to P for his injury.<br />
    Here in our Hypo this has no application.<br />
    &mdash;&mdash;<br />
    WRONGFUL DEATH<br />
    This is the other exception to the SCRAP rules given above.<br />
    If a defendant D is liable to a person P because of negligence, and P dies as a result, then D is liable to the dependents of P, even if D would have been liable to them had P lived.<br />
    For example, P has surgery on her leg, and she hires a nurse, D, to provide personal care for her. D has a duty to act to protect P from danger, because she agreed to do that in the contract, and she is getting paid for it. This is a contract between P and D, but it creates a duty that can result in a tort action.<br />
    If D fails to provide P with adequate care, and P&rsquo;s medical condition worsens, then D is liable to P for the injuries D has suffered as a result of P&rsquo;s negligence. But D is not liable to P&rsquo;s dependents because they were not &ldquo;intended third-party beneficiaries&rdquo; of the P-D contract. <br />
    But then if P dies because of D&rsquo;s negligence, P&rsquo;s dependents can bring a wrongful death action against D.<br />
    In our Hypo this has no application.<br />
    &mdash;-<br />
    Part 1 - P v. D<br />
    This question requires a lot of arguing both sides. <br />
    So you may conclude one thing like, &ldquo;D is not liable,&rdquo; and then you have to discuss the opposite like, &ldquo;But if D were liable then&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
    &mdash;-<br />
    DUTY AND BREACH<br />
    DUTY TO WEAR HELMET?<br />
    D assumed a duty to wear a helmet. He clearly breached his duty. <br />
    But the helmet rule of C was not intended to protect P, and that is the main thing being tested here.<br />
    Therefore, P has no case against D based on his breach of the job rule.<br />
    [Note: there is no evidence there was any statute requiring helmets. And although D and C had an employment contract, C hired D for the purpose of driving the motorcycle, not for the purpose of wearing a helmet.]<br />
    &mdash;-<br />
    DUTY TO DRIVE CAREFULLY?<br />
    D created peril by driving the motorcycle, so he had a duty to drive carefully. Did he breach that duty?<br />
    Many students leap to say D was not driving carefully because he did not wear his helmet. This idea has very little logic. By not wearing a helmet he put himself in danger in the case of an accident, but there is no reason to believe that wearing a helmet decreases the chances of injury to anyone else. <br />
    But for the sake of argument, perhaps D&rsquo;s failure to wear a helmet did constitute negligent driving on the part of D based on the argument (a very weak one) that one of the functions of a helmet is to protect motorcycle riders from objects hitting them on the head.<br />
    So it is best to say something like, &ldquo;It is not clear that failure to wear a helmet was a breach of D&rsquo;s duty to drive the motorcycle carefully.&rdquo;<br />
    &mdash;-<br />
    CAUSATION<br />
    P must prove both actual and proximate causation. By a preponderance of the evidence.<br />
    ACTUAL CAUSE?<br />
    Can P prove that D would not have fallen off the motorcycle if he had been wearing a helmet? NO. <br />
    D fell off the motorcycle because he was hit on the head with a bottle. There is nothing in the facts to suggest that if he had been wearing a helmet he would not have fallen off anyway.<br />
    So P probably cannot prove actual causation.<br />
    &mdash;-<br />
    UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENTS<br />
    D fell from the motorcycle because he was hit on the head by a bottle &ldquo;thrown&rdquo; at him. <br />
    INTENTIONALLY THROWN?<br />
    If the bottle was deliberately thrown at him, it was an intentional tort, and unforeseeable intervening event, and it would cut off all liability of D.<br />
    ACCIDENTALLY THROWN?<br />
    If the bottle was thrown by accident, it was just negligence and not an unforeseeable intervening event.<br />
    So P would argue the bottle was thrown by accident and D would argue it was thrown at him on purpose.<br />
    BURDEN OF PROOF?<br />
    P has to prove causation by the &ldquo;preponderance of evidence&rdquo; and it is not clear that could be done..<br />
    &mdash;-<br />
    ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK<br />
    P saw motorcycle coming at him and &ldquo;raced in front of it anyway&rdquo;. <br />
    &mdash;-<br />
    CONTRIBUTORY / COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE<br />
    If P did not appreciate the risks, then he was negligent.<br />
    &mdash;-<br />
    Part 1 - P v. C<br />
    RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR?<br />
    If D is liable it appears C would be liable because it seems D was acting within the scope of his employment. <br />
    DETOUR AND FROLIC?<br />
    But C might argue D was on a &ldquo;detour and frolic&rdquo; because he was not driving his &ldquo;regular route&rdquo;.<br />
    &mdash;-<br />
    NEGLIGENT SUPERVISION?<br />
    If C argued D was on a &ldquo;detour and frolic&rdquo; then P might argue that C was directly liable because it was negligent in the hiring, training and supervision of D since he &ldquo;often failed to comply&rdquo; with its rules. And while C was &ldquo;unaware&rdquo; of this, it should have been aware and must not have supervised him properly.<br />
    &mdash;-<br />
    Part 2 - D v Hondoco (H)<br />
    What are D&rsquo;s &ldquo;damages&rdquo; that he wants to recover? Apparently it is personal injury.<br />
    PRODUCT LIABILITY?<br />
    D must prove the motorcycle was &ldquo;unreasonably dangerous&rdquo; and that those unreasonable dangers were the cause of his injury.<br />
    Here the product has a &ldquo;gas leak&rdquo;. That sounds dangerous. Maybe it could cause a fire? And it is a &ldquo;defect&rdquo;. And H &ldquo;expressly warranted the motorcycle to be free from defects&rdquo;. So that &ldquo;express warranty&rdquo; and a &ldquo;defective product&rdquo; simply screams that you must discuss product liability. <br />
    But here is the trick - the &ldquo;defect&rdquo; was a &ldquo;gas leak&rdquo; that did not present any apparent dangers. It did not catch on fire. <br />
    And D had the leak fixed before the accident.  So the motorcycle was not &ldquo;unreasonably dangerous&rdquo; anymore. <br />
    The gas leak delayed D, but it did not cause the accident.<br />
    So D cannot prove the &ldquo;dangers&rdquo; posed by the motorcycle are what caused his injury.<br />
    CONTRACT ACTION?<br />
    What more can D claim? <br />
    A contract action is no way to recover damages for personal injury.<br />
    There was a contract between C and H that said the product was free from defects. And H knew the &ldquo;gas leak&rdquo; had occurred with other motorcycles. But D was not an intended third party beneficiary of that C-H contract.<br />
    So D has no standing to object to breach of the C-H contract.<br />
    So one can firmly say D has no case against H.<br />
    &mdash;-<br />
    Part 3 - C v. H on theories asserted by D?<br />
    What &ldquo;damages&rdquo; did C suffer? H reimbursed it for the motorcycle but it &ldquo;lost an account&rdquo;. That is economic loss - consequential losses.<br />
    PRODUCT LIABILITY?<br />
    Same problem - The motorcycle was not &ldquo;unreasonably dangerous&rdquo; at the time of the accident because D had the &ldquo;gas leak fixed.<br />
    CONTRACT ACTION?<br />
    C could claim H breached its contract. But the contract expressly disclaimed liability for &ldquo;consequential losses&rdquo;. <br />
    So C has no case.</p>
