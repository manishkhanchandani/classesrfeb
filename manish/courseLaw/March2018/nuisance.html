<p><strong>PRIVATE NUISANCE?</strong><br />
    Under tort law PRIVATE NUISANCE is an unreasonable interference with a person&rsquo;s use and enjoyment of their own land.</p>
<p><strong>PUBLIC NUISANCE?</strong><br />
Under tort law PUBLIC NUISANCE is an unreasonable interference with a person&rsquo;s use and enjoyment of public resources. To have standing the plaintiff must show particular injury, greater than that suffered by the general public.</p>
<p><strong>COMING TO THE NUISANCE? </strong><br />
Under tort law COMING TO THE NUISANCE is the defense that the plaintiff moved to the location where the condition complained of already existed. It is a complete bar in a MINORITY view, but in the MAJORITY view it is only a factor to be considered in determining damages. </p>
<p><strong>NUISANCE REMEDIES? </strong><br />
The REMEDIES for a nuisance action include both money damages and injunctive relief.</p>
<p>If the nuisance is a temporary situation money damages measured by the loss of use for the period of the nuisance will be an adequate remedy. If the nuisance would continue but for injunctive relief, the Court would consider granting an injunction. Injunctive relief is an equitable remedy, and the court has discretion to deny it. The Court will balance the interests of the parties, the interests of third parties and the feasibility of judicial enforcement. If the Court denies injunctive relief, the appropriate remedy is an award of money damages measured by the loss of property value caused by the nuisance. <br />

<p><strong>Practice Question 6</strong><br />
    Ken was a politician from Los Angeles. He moved to Sacramento and purchased a spacious home on the Sacramento River. He felt he got a great deal because he only paid $400,000 and a similar home in Los Angeles would have cost him three times that amount.<br />
    Ken realized his home was directly in the flight path of the airplanes taking off and landing from the County airport, and the realtor had prominently disclosed this fact on the sales documents. But Ken didn't think the noise was so bad because from his backyard he just loved to hear little birds singing along the public river parkway.<br />
    Four years later Ken lost the election and he wanted to move back to Los Angeles. When he had the house appraised, it was worth $500,000. Ken was furious because his home value had only increased 25 percent in value while most real estate had gone up 50 percent.<br />
    Ken blamed the County. In the four years he owned the home the number of flights at the airport increased ten percent. This increased traffic was from increased military use in response to the crisis in Romaria. Ken could not enjoy his yard as much as before, and the little birds on the public river parkway didn't seem to sing as much as they used to.<br />
What actions might Ken bring against the County, what defenses might be raised, and what remedies are appropriate?</p>
<p>[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This question is roughly based on true events. The point to remember is that &quot;coming to the nuisance&quot; is not a complete bar to recovery. If a defendant unreasonably interferes with the use of land, a new purchaser might &quot;buy into the right to sue&quot; for a nuisance the previous owner did not litigate.<br />
    Just state the rule and prove (or disprove) the elements. Here Ken&rsquo;s case is rather weak, so you may have to give &ldquo;conditional&rdquo; conclusions.<br />
    Discussion of &ldquo;defenses&rdquo; and &ldquo;remedies&rdquo; is mandatory because the CALL specifically asks for it.]<br />
</p>
<p>Sample Answer 16-6: Nuisance<br />
    KEN v. COUNTY<br />
    1) PRIVATE NUISANCE?<br />
    Under tort law PRIVATE NUISANCE is an unreasonable interference with the plaintiffs&rsquo; use and enjoyment of their land.<br />
    Here there was some interference because the County airport caused &quot;noise&quot; that prevented Ken from &quot;enjoying his yard&quot; and &quot;hearing the birds.&quot; And this involved the use of Ken's land because it was his &quot;house&quot; and &quot;yard.&quot;<br />
    The two elements that would be most difficult to prove are whether Ken suffered significant damages, and whether the County action was unreasonable. The County would argue that the noise was insufficient interference to prevent Ken from enjoying his land because Ken &quot;didn't think the noise was so bad&quot; when he bought the house. He in effect CAME TO THE NUISANCE, and that fact suggests the situation was not as bad as Ken claims.<br />
    But Ken would try to prove that the interference was unreasonable because the County let flights increase &ldquo;ten percent&quot; in only &quot;four years.&quot;<br />
    The County would also argue it did not cause the nuisance, and had not acted irresponsibly. The County might argue it was not responsible because the increase in noise was caused by &quot;military use&quot; beyond their control. Alternatively, the County would argue that it acted reasonably because the flights were in response to the &quot;Romaria crisis.&quot;<br />
    Ken would argue he suffered damages because the value of his home was less that it otherwise would be. But the County would argue there was no proof of financial loss because the home had gone up in value and the claim of loss was speculative. Further, the County would argue there was no proof the birds did not sing as much as before.<br />
    Therefore, the County might be liable for private nuisance depending on whether Ken could prove these legal elements.<br />
    2) PUBLIC NUISANCE?<br />
    Under tort law PUBLIC NUISANCE is an unreasonable interference with the plaintiff's use and enjoyment of public resources causing her particular injury that is different or greater than the general public.<br />
    Here the noise interferes with the enjoyment of public land because it prevents Ken from &quot;hearing the birds sing&quot; on the &quot;public river parkway.&quot;<br />
    The County may argue that Ken lacks standing because he does not suffer any injury that is different from any other member of the public. But Ken suffers particular injury because his home is &quot;on the river&quot; and he could hear the birds sing &quot;from his backyard.&quot;</p>
<p>Ken would have to prove the other elements of nuisance which are discussed above under private nuisance.<br />
    Therefore, the County may be liable for public nuisance, depending on whether Ken can prove the County&rsquo;s action is unreasonable and produces significant damages.<br />
    3) COMING TO THE NUISANCE?<br />
    Under tort law COMING TO THE NUISANCE is the defense that the plaintiff moved to the location where the condition complained of already existed. It is a complete bar in a MINORITY view, but in the MAJORITY view it is only a factor to be considered in determining damages.<br />
    Here Ken moved to the location because he &quot;purchased the home.&quot; And the condition already existed because he &quot;realized his home was in the flight path&quot; and the &quot;realtor disclosed the fact.&quot;<br />
    Ken would argue that even though problems existed when he bought the home, they worsened after that. Further, he would argue that in any event the County action is unreasonable per se.<br />
    Therefore, the court would consider Ken's coming to the nuisances only as a factor in determining damages in most States.<br />
    4) REMEDIES?<br />
    The REMEDIES for a nuisance action include both money damages and injunctive relief.<br />
    If the nuisance is a temporary situation money damages measured by the loss of use for the period of the nuisance will be an adequate remedy. If the nuisance would continue but for injunctive relief, the Court would consider granting an injunction. Injunctive relief is an equitable remedy, and the court has discretion to deny it. The Court will balance the interests of the parties, the interests of third parties and the feasibility of judicial enforcement. If the Court denies injunctive relief, the appropriate remedy is an award of money damages measured by the loss of property value caused by the nuisance.<br />
    Here the nuisance is a permanent condition, so the Court would consider injunctive relief. But the interest of third parties, people who use the airport, the military, and the County residents would be so significant the Court is unlikely to issue an injunction stopping the airport from continuing operations.<br />
    Therefore the Court would most likely award Ken money damages to reflect the loss of market value of his property caused by the increase in airport traffic.</p>
