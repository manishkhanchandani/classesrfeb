<p>Practice Question 7<br />
    Star approached Buck, the owner of JavaManiac, with a business proposal. Star knew where there was a retail space for lease that would be a great place for a JavaManiac franchise. Buck told Star that she would be granted a JavaManiac license if the location was acceptable. Based on this Star described the location in detail and gave Buck its address. Buck said he would have someone &quot;check it out.&quot;<br />
    Buck had no intention of giving Star a franchise. He just wanted her to reveal the location. Based on Star's description it sounded perfect for a JavaManiac outlet, and Buck wanted to take the space himself.<br />
    Buck went to the location suggested by Star and saw that it was perfect for JavaManiac. He then contacted the owner, Jack. Jack said he already had tentatively promised the lease to someone named Star. Buck said, &quot;I know Star,&quot; and held his hand in the air with his thumb out to indicate that Star had a drinking problem. Then Buck looked at Jack very sincerely and said, &quot;I probably shouldn't say this, but I feel I have a duty to tell you that you don't want to lease to someone like Star.&quot;<br />
    Buck reported to Star that the location was unacceptable because it was too small to meet the secret JavaManiac minimum guidelines.<br />
    Star was very dejected and withdrew her offer to lease the space. Jack was relieved.<br />
    Three months later Star happened upon the grand opening of the next new JavaManiac franchise at the very location he had suggested. Standing in front were Buck and Jack shaking hands. Star was furious and accused Buck of cheating her. Buck rolled his eyes at Jack and said, &quot;See what I mean?&quot;<br />
    Then Buck sued Star for slander per se for accusing him of questionable business practices. Star won the suit when the jury found her statements had been true.<br />
    What are Star's possible actions against Buck? (Do not discuss intentional infliction, defamation or false light.)</p>
<p>[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This very short question is intended to focus on the elements that must be proven for fraud, interference, and abuse of process.<br />
    Intentional infliction, defamation and false light were excluded by the call because they are covered in other questions.<br />
    There is no evidence of IIED anyway because Star did not suffer &ldquo;severe emotional distress.&rdquo; You are unlikely to ever get such a short, simple question on a real exam.]<br />
</p>
<p>Sample Answer 16-7: Miscellaneous Torts<br />
    STAR v. BUCK 1) FRAUD?<br />
    Under tort law FRAUD is based on false representations of fact by the defendant made knowingly with intent to deceive that are reasonably relied upon by the plaintiff causing damages.<br />
    Here Buck made a statement of fact when he said a franchise &quot;would be granted&quot; if the location was suitable, and that was false because he had &ldquo;no intention&rdquo; of granting Star a franchise. He intended to deceive because he wanted her to reveal the location, and Star reasonably relied on his representation because she did reveal the location. That caused her damages because Buck used the information to convince Jack not to lease the &ldquo;perfect location&rdquo; to Star.<br />
    Buck also made false statements when he told Star the location was &quot;too small for a franchise.&quot; He intended to deceive her so she would not go through with her lease plans. And she reasonably relied on that statement because she &ldquo;withdrew&rdquo; her offer to Jack. That caused her damages because she otherwise would have secured the lease.<br />
    Therefore, Star can prove the elements of fraud and Buck may be liable for the damages she suffered.<br />
    2) TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE?<br />
    Under tort law INTERFERENCE is an unreasonable interference with the plaintiff's known business relationships causing damages.<br />
    Here Buck interfered with Star's business relationship with Jack by suggesting to him that &quot;Star drank&quot; and was a &quot;bad tenant choice&quot;. Buck also interfered by telling Star the space was &quot;too small for a coffee shop&quot;.<br />
    Buck did these acts knowing that he was interfering with the business relationship between Jack and Star because Jack had told him he, &quot;promised the location to Star.&quot; The acts were unreasonable because they were intentional false statements intended to damage Star. And they caused Star damages because it prevented her from completing the lease agreement with Jack.<br />
    Therefore, Buck can be liable for tortious interference.<br />
    3) ABUSE OF PROCESS?<br />
    Under tort law ABUSE OF PROCESS is bringing a civil action against the plaintiff without<br />
    legitimate basis out of malice and for an improper purpose.<br />
    Here Buck brought a civil action against Star because he &quot;sued Star for slander.&quot; And he had no legitimate basis because all of Star's statements were true. Buck acted out of malice and for an improper purpose because he was trying to refute Star's statements and hide the truth.<br />
    Therefore, Buck could be liable for abuse of process.</p>
