			"description": "C is the correct answer. The prima facie case for defamation requires defamatory language concerning the plaintiff, publication of that language by the defendant to a third person, and damage to the reputation of the plaintiff. Here, the issue is whether there was publication by the defendant. The publication requirement is satisfied where there is communication of the defamatory statement to a third person who understood it. That communication can be either intentional, or the result of negligence. Therefore, if the woman had no reason to foresee that her statement would be overheard by another person, then there was no negligent or intentional communication and the man will not prevail on his defamation claim. <br /> <br /> A is incorrect because the defamatory statement was verbal, so the man would also normally need to prove special damages (pecuniary). However, the woman's comment was one regarding the man's trade or occupation, making it slander per se, and injury will be presumed. B is incorrect because a defamatory communication can be made negligently as well as intentionally.

When a party's obligation under a contract is subject to a satisfaction condition, generally the party may not avoid liability simply by expressing dissatisfaction with the performance - the dissatisfaction must be expressed either reasonably or in good faith, depending on the nature of the obligation.

The final week's delay was caused by the photographer's not being notified promptly by the customer of his recovery. Before taking the photograph of the customer and his family, the photographer advised the customer that he was likely to be delayed a day or two beyond December 15 in making delivery because of the time required to process the photograph and cards. The customer told the photographer to take the photograph anyway. The cards were finally delivered by the photographer to the customer on December 17, the photographer having diligently worked on them in the interim. Although the cards pleased the rest of the family, the customer refused to accept them because, as he said squinting at one of the cards at arm's length without bothering to put on his reading glasses, \"The photograph makes me look too old.
