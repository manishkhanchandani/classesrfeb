<h1>Murder</h1>
<p>How to write a Essay (simple)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Homicide (IRAC Homicide)</strong></p>
<p>Under criminal law, Homicide is  <strong>killing</strong> of one<strong> human being by another</strong> human being.</p>
<p>Here ... because .... Therefore ....</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Causation</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Actual Cause:</strong><br />
An actual cause is the cause which starts, ignites or makes possible the result which follows, and which satisfies &quot;But for&quot; or &quot;Substantial Factor Test&quot;.</p>
<p>Here .... because .... Therefore ....</p>
<p>&quot;But For&quot;: To apply the test, the state must show that &quot;but for&quot; the defendant's act, the harm would have not occured.</p>
<p>Here .... because .... Therefore ....</p>
<p>&quot;Substantial Factor Test&quot;: The defendant is said to be an actual cause of the harm if the defendant's act is a substantial factor in bringing the harm about.</p>
<p>Here .... because .... Therefore ....</p>
<p><strong>B. Proximate Cause</strong></p>
<p>Under the criminal law, an actual cause of harm is also a proximate cause if the act is closely connected enough to the resulting harm that it is fair to hold the defendant responsible for causing the harm.</p>
<p>Here .... because .... Therefore ....</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: MURDER</strong><br />
Under criminal law, MURDER is an <strong>unlawful homicide</strong>, the <strong>killing</strong> of one<strong> human being by another</strong> with <strong>malice aforethought</strong>.</p>
<p>Here .... because .... Therefore ....</p>
<p>Malice can be shown in <strong>one of the four </strong>way: </p>
<ol>
  <li>an intent to kill (expressed by defendant)</li>
  <li> an intent to cause serious bodily harm (implied by action)  </li>
  <li>a wanton and willful disregard of human life (implied by action) [ DEPREVAED HEART THEORY ] </li>
  <li>an intent to commit a dangerous felony (implied by action) </li>
</ol>
<p>Here .... because .... Therefore ....</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: FIRST DEGREE MURDER</strong><br />
First degree murder is murder committed by poison; torture; lying in wait; or other willful, deliberate and premeditated means; or murder that results from application of the Felony Murder Rule.  </p>
<p>At common law there were no degrees of murder but modernly statutes define first degree murder as those that are 1) willful, deliberate and premeditated, 2) by enumerated means, or 3) caused by the commission of enumerated felonies. All other murders are second degrees.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Felony Murder Rule:
					</strong><br />
Under the felony murder rule, if a death occurs during the attempt or commission of a serious felony, is causally related to that felony, and is not a lesser included offense, then the felon can be charged with first degree murder. </p>
<p>Felonies like BARRKSS, Burglary, Arson, Robbery, Rape, Kidnapping, Sodomy, Sexual Molestation</p>
<p>Here death occured during the commission / attempt of Robbery because .... Therefore ....</p>
<p>Here death caused by acts done during the RES GESTAE of an inherently dangerous felony because ... Therefore ...</p>
<p> Here it is not a lesser included offense because ... Therefore ....</p>
<p>Therefore felon can be charged with first degree murder.</p>
<p>Common law, Felon kill another felon or innocent kill felon, it is felony murder rule.</p>
<p>Modern law: Felon kill another felon, felony murder rule, innocent kill felon, no felony murder rule</p>
<p>Minority law: Felon kill another felon, felony murder rule, innocent kill felon, no felony murder rule</p>
<p><strong>REDLINE RULE </strong><br />
Under the REDLINE RULE a co-felon  in many States cannot be charged with murder under the FELONY MURDER RULE simply because a co-felon was killed by a victim, bystander or the police during the commission of a crime. </p>
<p>Here the rule would apply because …</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: SECOND DEGREE MURDER</strong><br />
Second degree murder is all murders which are not first degree murder, in other words, those homicides committed with malice aforethought but which do not meet the requirements of the first degree.</p>
<p>Here .... because .... Therefore ....</p>
<p>Step 6: DEFENSES</p>
<p>A. SELF DEFENSE</p>
<p>B. DEFENSE OF OTHERS</p>
<p>C. DEFENSE OF PROPERTY</p>
<p>D. PREVENTION OF CRIME</p>
<p>E. PUBLIC AUTHORITY</p>
<p>F. DOMESTIC AUTHORITY</p>
<p>G. NECESSITY</p>
<p>Step 7: JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>A. Mistake of law</p>
<p>B. Mistake of fact</p>
<p>C. Consent</p>
<p>D. Duress</p>
<p>E. Entrapment</p>
<p>Step 8: Excuses</p>
<p>A. Infancy</p>
<p>B. Intoxication</p>
<p>C. Insanity</p>
<p><strong>INSANITY TEST</strong></p>
<p>M'Naghten Test
  <br />
  Under this test, due to mental disease, defendant did not know what he did was morally wrong or he did not understand the nature/quality of his act.  </p>
<p>Here .... because .... Therefore ....</p>
<p>Irresistible Impulse Test
  <br />
  Under this test, due to mental disease, defendant knows that he is doing wrong, but he cannot control his behavior.  </p>
<p>Here .... because .... Therefore ....</p>
<p>Model Penal Code Test<br />
Due to mental disease, defendant lacks substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or the capacity to conform his conduct to the requirement of law. </p>
<p>Here there was mental disease because .... Therefore ....<br />
Here defendant lacks substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct because .... Therefore ....<br />
Here defendant lacks the capacity to conform his conuct to the requirement of law because .... Therefore .... </p>
<p>Durham test
  <br />
  Because of mental defect, defendant committed an unlawful act. </p>
<p>Here there was a mental defect because .... Therefore defendant committed an unlawful act.</p>
<p>Step 9: Voluntary Manslaughter</p>
<p>Under criminal law, VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER is an<strong> unlawful, intentional homicide</strong> without malice aforethought because of <strong>adequate provocation</strong> sufficient to raise a<strong> resonable person</strong> to a fit of rage which could and actually did cause the homicide.</p>
<p>Here .... because .... Therefore ....</p>
<p><strong>Step 10: Involuntary Manslaughte</strong>r</p>
<p>Under CRIMINAL LAW, INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER is an UNINTENDED homicide, the killing of one human being by another, as a result of CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE, RECKLESSNES, or during the commission of a MALUM IN SE crime insufficient for a charge of murder.</p>
<p>Here .... because .... Therefore ....</p>
<p>How to write a murder?</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>SAMPLE ESSAY</strong></p>
<p>Karen was furious because her lover Billy ran off with Mary. Karen decided to kill Mary and looked for some dynamite to blow Mary straight to Hell. </p>
<p>Karen went to a &quot;Dynamite R Us Store&quot;, but the owner Marvin refused to sell her any dynamite. Karen pulled a gun and demanded quality service like it said on the sign in the window. Marvin said, &quot;Yes, Ma'am!&quot; and handed over 12 sticks of dynamite. Karen was happy with the service. But as she was putting away the gun, it accidentally went off and shot Marvin between the eyes. Karen felt real bad about it. </p>
<p>As Karen approached Mary's mobile home she was stopped by Ruby. Ruby gave her a hard look. Ruby &quot;dissed&quot; her. Ruby challenged her to a spelling bee and criticized her choice of attire. That was all more than Karen could take, because she always had a short fuse. So she smoked Ruby above the ear with a round from the '38. </p>
<p>Karen proceeded to put the dynamite under Mary's double-wide &quot;Jerry Springer&quot; brand mobile home. She realized that the blast would probably kill Billy too, and she felt real bad about it. Billy was the reason she was acting out, her love for him and all. But the way she figured, a girl's got to do what a girl's got to do. So she washed that man right out of her hair. </p>
<p>That night the blast killed both Mary and Billy. </p>
<p>Discuss the potential first degree murder charges Karen might face along with lesser included offenses and her potential defenses.</p>
<p><strong>EXPLANATION</strong></p>


<div>
  <p>[<strong>ANSWER EXPLANATION:</strong> This purpose of this question was to present four murders, each representing one of the four types of malice for murder. Marvin is a &ldquo;felony-murder rule&rdquo; situation, Ruby is a &ldquo;great bodily injury&rdquo; case, Mary is an &ldquo;intent to kill&rdquo; case, and Bill is a &ldquo;depraved heart theory&rdquo; case. </p>
  <p>A second purpose of the question is to illustrate that &ldquo;depraved heart murder&rdquo; is not necessarily a &ldquo;second degree&rdquo; murder. </p>
  <p>The question asks about &ldquo;first degree&quot; murder, and it is an express call. The call also asks about &quot;lessor included offenses.&quot; That means manslaughter and NOT assault, battery, robbery, etc. </p>
  <p>You must define and discuss robbery as a basis for the felony-murder rule application to some extent. A death caused by a robbery is almost always going to be first degree murder because virtually every State includes it as one of its &ldquo;enumerated felonies&rdquo;. </p>
  <p>Only one murder here presents any evidence of &quot;provocation&quot; or &ldquo;mitigating factors&rdquo;.] </p>
</div>

<p><strong>ISSUES</strong></p>
<p>STATE v. KAREN</p>
<p>1. MURDER of Marvin?</p>
<p>2. MURDER of Ruby?</p>
<p>3. ADEQUATE PROVOCATION for VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER?</p>
<p>4. MURDER of Mary?</p>
<p>5. MURDER of Bill?</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>STATE v. KAREN</p>
<p>1. MURDER of Marvin?</p>
<p>Under criminal law, MURDER is an <strong>unlawful homicide</strong>, the <strong>killing</strong> of one<strong> human being by another</strong> with <strong>malice aforethought</strong>. Malice for murder may be 1) express intent to kill, or implied by 2) intentionally causing great bodily injury, 3) intentionally committing an inherently dangerous felony, the FELONY MURDER RULE, or 4) intentionally acting with an awerness of and conscious disregard for unreasonable risks to human life, the DEPREVAED HEART THEORY.</p>
<p>The felony-murder rule applies to deaths caused by acts done during the RES GESTAE of an inherently dangerous felony, the events beginning with the first substantial step toward the commisssion of the crime and ending when the defendants leave the scene of crime and reach a place of relative safety.</p>
<p>At common law there were no degrees of murder but modernly statutes define first degree murder as those that are 1) willful, deliberate and premeditated, 2) by enumerated means, or 3) caused by the commission of enumerated felonies. All other murders are second degrees.</p>
<p>Here there was an <strong>unlawful homicide</strong> because Marvin was a human being and he was killed by Lucy, another human being. And it was caused by <strong>commission of an inherently dangerous felony</strong>, ROBBERY, a larceny from the person by force of fear. Karen was <strong>taking personal property of another with intent to permenantly deprive</strong> because she was taking &quot;dynamite&quot; from Marvin and she was using <strong>force or fear </strong>to overcome his will to resist because she used a &quot;gun&quot;. The death of Marvin occured within the RES GESTAE of the robbery becuase he ws shot before <strong>she left the scene</strong> of crime.</p>
<p>Therefore, Karen can be charged with murder of Killing Marvin during the robbery. This would typically be FIRST DEGREE MURDER because robbery is typically one of the &quot;enumerated felonies&quot; for first degree murder.</p>
<p>More para to include, Homicide IRAC, Causation - Actual / Proximate, Murder, First Degree Murder, Felony Murder Rule, Robbery</p>
<p>2. MURDER of Ruby?</p>
<p>MURDER is defined above.</p>
<p>There was unlawful homicide because Ruby was a human being killed by Karen, another human being, without legal justification.</p>
<p>Here Karen appears to have acted with an <strong>express intent to kill</strong> because she shot Ruby in the &quot;head&quot; with a &quot;gun&quot;. These facts imply an intent to kill. Alternatively Karen clearly intended <strong>great bodily injury</strong> because homicide was caused by a &quot;firearm&quot;. Use of a firearm implies intent to cause serious bodily harm, regardless of where the victim is shot.</p>
<p>Karen also appears to have acted with an<strong> awareness and conscious disregard for danger to human life</strong> because she deliberately shot Ruby in the head for little good reason. Her act created <strong>extreme risks</strong> to Ruby, she apparently had an <strong>awerness</strong> of the risks and <strong>consciously disregarded</strong> them.</p>
<p>Based on any of the above theories, Karen could be charged with the murder of Ruby.</p>
<p>It appears Karen killed Ruby willfully and deliberately. If that is proven the murder was FIRST DEGREE. Karen might argue that she did not act willfully and deliberately to kill Ruby and only reacted instinctively because she had a &quot;short fuse&quot;, a MITIGATING FACTOR that caused her to suffer from imparied capacity.</p>
<p>If Karen can convince the jury she acted instinctively and did not act willfully, deliberately and with premeditation the murder might be reduced to SECOND DEGREE.</p>
<p>3. ADEQUATE PROVOCATION for VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER?</p>
<p>Under criminal law, VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER is an<strong> unlawful, intentional homicide</strong> without malice aforethought because of <strong>adequate provocation</strong> sufficient to raise a<strong> resonable person</strong> to a fit of rage which could and actually did cause the homicide.</p>
<p>Generally &quot;mere words alone&quot; are not considered at law to be adequate provocaiton.</p>
<p>Here there was lack of <strong>adequate provocation</strong> because &quot;hard looks&quot;, being &quot;dissed&quot;, challenged to a &quot;spelling bee&quot; and &quot;criticisms of attire&quot; are &quot;mere words alone&quot; that would not be sufficient to raise a<strong> reasonable person</strong> to a fit of murderous rage. The subjective factor that Karen &quot;had a short fuse&quot; would not lower the standard of conduct.</p>
<p>Therefore, karen would not succeed in reducing the murder charge to voluntary manslaughter.</p>
<p>4. MURDER of Mary?</p>
<p>Murder is defined above.</p>
<p>Here there was a homicide because Mary was a<strong> human being</strong> killed by Karen, <strong>another human being</strong>. And Karen had an <strong>express intent to kill</strong> because she "decided to kill Mary". Further, this killing was <strong>willful, deliberate and premeditated</strong> because it was planned in advance.</p>
<p>herefore, Karen can be charged with FIRST DEGREE murder of Mary and she has no defense.</p>
<p>5. MURDER of Bill?</p>
<p>Murder is defined above.</p>
<p>Here there was a homicide because Bill was a <strong>human being</strong> killed by Karen, <strong>another human being</strong>. Karen may have had an express intent to kill because she "knew the blast would probably kill Bill." But Karen would argue that she did not want to kill Bill because "she felt real bad about it." Regardless, Karen deliberately created extreme risks to human life with awareness of and conscious disregard because she "knew the blast would probably kill Bill."<br /><br />
Therefore, Karen could be charged with murder based on a Depraved Heart Theory of malice..<br /><br />
Further, this would generally be FIRST DEGREE murder because the use of explosives to murder is generally one of the "enumerated means" for first degree murder.<br /><br />
Therefore, Karen can probably be charged with FIRST DEGREE murder of Bill even if she did not willfully and deliberately cause his death with premeditation. She has no defenses.</p>
