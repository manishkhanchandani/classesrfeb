<h1>Products Liability</h1>
<p>How to write a Essay (simple)</p>
<p>Under tort law, anyone who RELEASES an&nbsp;<strong>UNREASONABLY DANGEROUS</strong>&nbsp;product into the STREAM OF COMMERCE is liable for&nbsp;<strong>PERSONAL INJURY</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>PROPERTY DAMAGE CAUSED</strong>. A product is UNREASONABLY DANGEROUS if the<strong>&nbsp;dangers it poses</strong>&nbsp;outweigh its&nbsp;<strong>utility&nbsp;</strong>given the&nbsp;<strong>commercial practicality </strong>for making it&nbsp;<strong>safer, without destroying its utility</strong>.</p>
<p>Liability may be established based on any of four theories: 1) BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY, 2) BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY, 3) NEGLIGENCE or 4) STRICT LIABILITY IN TORT.</p>
<p>Under a BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY theory, the plaintiff must show the defendant sold goods with&nbsp;<strong>express representations</strong>&nbsp;(express warranty) which made them unreasonably dangerous, and that it was the actual and proximate cause of injury to the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Further, under a BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY theory the plaintiff must show the defendant sold goods by representing they were&nbsp;<strong>safe for ordinary use</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>knowing the buyer's specific intended use</strong>&nbsp;(implied warranty), the goods were unreasonably dangerous for that use, and that it was the actual and proximate cause of injury to the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Under a NEGLIGENCE theory, the defendant has a duty not to place&nbsp;<strong>unreasonably dangerous goods into the stream of commerce</strong>. The plaintiff must be a foreseeable plaintiff proximately caused injury by the negligent acts of the defendant.</p>
<p>And, under a STRICT LIABILITY theory, the plaintiff must show the seller was a&nbsp;<strong>COMMERCIAL SUPPLIER</strong>, the product was unreasonably dangerous at the time it left the defendant's control, and the defendant is&nbsp;<strong>only liable for non-economic damages</strong>.</p>
<p>Here&hellip; because&hellip; Therefore &hellip;</p>
<p>How to write a product liability tort?</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong><br />
IRAC Definition: Under tort law, anyone who RELEASES an&nbsp;<strong>UNREASONABLY DANGEROUS</strong>&nbsp;product into the STREAM OF COMMERCE is liable for&nbsp;<strong>PERSONAL INJURY</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>PROPERTY DAMAGE CAUSED</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong><br />
IRAC Why it is dangerous: A product is unreasonably dangerous if it 1) poses <strong>serious and likely dangers</strong>, that 2) <strong>could be reduced or eliminated easil</strong>y, 3) <strong>without damaging product utility</strong>, or else 4) the <strong>product utility does not justify the dangers</strong> posed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong><br />
IRAC Defect Type: In order to recover, it must be proved that the product is defective in:</p>
<p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-1deeb132-57a6-b44c-6205-4062eb2854cd">A. Design Defect</strong> (product designed as intended, but creates an unreasonable danger to consumers)</p>
<p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-1deeb132-57a6-fe74-3a0b-37780bc161a6">B. Manufacture</strong> (product is not made as intended) - look for product to be different from the rest due to bad assembly, materials, or parts </p>
<p><strong>C.</strong><strong id="docs-internal-guid-1deeb132-57a7-8ac4-0287-094dd3c668f6"> Warning </strong>(dangers not apparent to customers)</p>
<p>Step 4<br />
IRAC Theories: </p>
<p>A. Breach of Express Warranty: Under tort law there is a BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY if a product is sold with 1) <strong>express representations</strong> that the buyer 2) <strong>relies</strong> on and 3) the representation are <strong>incorrect</strong> and 4) it <strong>causes the purchaser injury</strong>. The seller is liable to foreseeable plaintiffs, those with privity of contract or their family. </p>
<p>B. Breach of Implied Warranty: Under tort law, there is a BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY if a product is<strong> unsafe for ordinary use or for the buyer's known intended use</strong>, the <strong>buyer relies on the expertise of the seller</strong>, and the buyer is injured as a result. The seller is liable to foreseeable plaintiffs, those with privity of contract or their family.</p>
<p>C. Negligence: Under a NEGLIGENCE theory, the defendant has a duty not to place&nbsp;<strong>unreasonably dangerous goods into the stream of commerce</strong>. To prevail the plaintiff must prove duty, breach, actual cause, proximate cause and damages. </p>
<p>DUTY? Under tort law a person has a duty to not put an unreasonably dangerous product into the stream of commerce. Further, a person who makes express representation about a product assumes a duty of due care to make sure they are accurate and will not create peril.</p>
<p>BREACH? Failure to adopt proper duty towards plaintiff is breach. P must show the product failed to meet ordinary commercial expectation</p>
<p>CAUSATION? P must show that D was the actual and proximate cause. That was the ACTUAL CAUSE of his injury because he would not have been hurt if he did not buy the product. This was also the PROXIMATE CAUSE of injury because it was the direct and foreseeable result.</p>
<p>DAMAGES? Limited to personal and property. Punitive available for reckless conduct.</p>
<p>D. Strict Liability: Under tort law,<strong> commercial seller </strong>of a product is strictly liable for<strong> personal injury</strong> or <strong>property damage</strong> if the product is <strong>unreasonably dangerous </strong>at the time it leaves the seller. The seller is liable to any person who is injured as a result. </p>
<p>E. <strong>Intentional: </strong>In order for the plaintiff to recover on a theory of intent (battery), the plaintiff must prove that the manufacturer, distributor or supplier knew the product would cause harm.</p>
<br />
<p>And Explain in each case if that case if plaintiff can recover or not?</p>
<p><strong>MacPherson v. Buick</strong></p>
<p>In this landmark case, Justice Cardozo dispensed with the previously applied requirement of privity of contract in products liability cases and extended the manufacturer's duty of care to include the ultimate consumer of the product, whether or not the consumer was the actual purchaser of the product. Later cases extended the duty to include not just the purchaser or the ultimate consumer, but to include all persons and property likely to be endangered by the product's probable use, such as the consumer's family or guests, or even near bystanders.</p>
<p><strong>SAMPLE ESSAY</strong></p>
<p>The Macho-X99 chainsaw is a light-duty chainsaw designed for trees no bigger than 18&quot;. In the owner's manual said in big red letters, &quot;WARNING -- NEVER TRY TO CUT DOWN A TREE BIGGER THAN 18&quot; OR THIS SAW MIGHT CATCH FIRE.&quot; There were no warnings on the saw itself. </p>
<p>Tom went into Sam's Bargain Center. Sam told him, &quot;This is the best chainsaw on the market. The Macho-X99 will cut trees up to 36&quot; in diameter.&quot; Tom bought the Macho-X99 chainsaw. </p>
<p>Dick went into Sam's Bargain Center and said he didn't know much about chainsaws but needed one that could cut a tree about 24&quot; in diameter. Sam told him, &quot;I am an expert when it comes to chainsaws. I recommend this Macho-X99.&quot; Dick bought the Macho-X99 chainsaw. </p>
<p>Moe went into Sam's Bargain Center and bought the Macho-X99 chainsaw without any discussion. </p>
<p>Sam, Tom and Dick never read the owner's manual and were unaware of the potential fire danger. When Tom and Dick tried to cut down trees bigger than 18&quot; the saws burst into flames and burned them. </p>
<p>Moe saw the warning in the owner's manual and tried to return the saw. Sam refused to give Moe his money back. Moe was disgusted and threw the saw in the garbage &ldquo;Dumpster&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Harry saw Moe's old saw in the garbage and took it. There was no owner's manual, but the saw was just like brand new. When he first used the saw it burst into flames and burned him. </p>
<p>Discuss all the theories under which Tom, Dick and Harry would seek to recover from Sam. Under which theories can they NOT recover? </p>
<p><strong>EXPLANATION</strong></p>
<div>
      <p>[<strong>ANSWER EXPLANATION:</strong> This question calls for a discussion of the four theories of product liability. The facts are intended to illustrate the differences between express and implied breach along with the fact that strict product liability theory extends to remote plaintiffs. </p>
      <p>The preliminary discussion of whether this is an &ldquo;unreasonably dangerous product&rdquo; or not is very, very important. Stating the &ldquo;balance&rdquo; test given here is MANDATORY if you want to score maximum points. </p>
      <p>Be wary of products that are not really &ldquo;unreasonably dangerous&rdquo; at all because they have been extensively tested, have great utility (often saves lives), pose trivial risks (turns hair green) to a very small number of users (less than 0.05%), and what little danger they pose is totally unknown to the manufacturer or simply cannot be easily eliminated. That is NOT an unreasonably dangerous product! </p>
      <p>As for Harry, it is not clear if a person can prevail on a products liability claim if the product has been discarded, scrapped or abandoned. The purpose of product liability law is to protect consumers and regular users of products, not &ldquo;Dumpster Divers&rdquo;. There is a strong argument that a product is no longer in the &ldquo;stream of commerce&rdquo; after it has been discarded or scrapped. </p>
      <p>Here it seems that Harry put the product back in the stream of commerce by retrieving it from the Dumpster. Also he has assumed the risk by doing that since he knew or should have known something might be wrong with a product that has been discarded.] </p>

<p>4. NEGLIGENCE?</p>
<p>5. STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY?  </p>
<p>B. DICK V SAM</p>
<p>6. BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY?</p>
<p>7. BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY?</p>
<p>8. NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY? </p>
<p>C. HARRY V SAM  </p>
<p>9. BREACH OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY?</p>
<p>10. NEGLIGENCE?</p>
<p>11. STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY?   </p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>A. TOM V SAM</p>
<p>Under PRODUCT LIABILITY LAW a person who places an unreasonably dangerous product into the stream of commerce may be liable for the injury it causes. There are four basic theories on which a product liability action may be brought: Breach of Express Warranty, Breach of Implied Warranty, Negligence and Strict Liability. </p>
<p>1. UNREASONABLY DANGEROUS?</p>
<p>A product is unreasonably dangerous if it 1) poses <strong>serious and likely dangers</strong>, that 2) <strong>could be reduced or eliminated easil</strong>y, 3) <strong>without damaging product utility</strong>, or else 4) the <strong>product utility does not justify the dangers</strong> posed.</p>
<p>Here the product presented serious and likely dangers because it could burst into flame under normal use, and those dangers could have been eliminated or reduced eaisly by putting a warning on the saw.  </p>
<p>Therefore this was an unreasonably dangerous product at the time of sale. </p>
<p><strong>DEFECT TYPE</strong></p>
<p>There are three kinds of defects. DESIGN DEFECT: Product is made as intended but creates unreasonable danger to the consumers. MANUFACTURING DEFECT: (product is not made as intended) - look for product to be different from the rest due to bad assembly, materials, or parts. WARNING DEFECT: Dangers not apparent to customers.</p>
<p>Here the product is of WARNING DEFECT because defect is not apparent to the consumers, and  warning is only mentioned in the owners manual. This defect could have been avoided by putting warning message on the saw itself.</p>
<p>Therefore the product has warning defect.</p>
<p>2. BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY?</p>
<p>Under tort law there is a BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY if a product is sold with 1) <strong>express representations</strong> that the buyer 2) <strong>relies</strong> on and 3) the representation are <strong>incorrect</strong> and 4) it <strong>causes the purchaser injury</strong>. The seller is liable to foreseeable plaintiffs, those with privity of contract or their family. </p>
<p>Here Sam made <strong>express representations</strong> to Tom because he said the saw &quot;would cut 36&quot; trees&quot; and Tom <strong>relied</strong> because he &quot;bought&quot; the saw. This was <strong>incorrect</strong> because the saw would only cut &quot;18&quot; trees&quot;, and this caused <strong>injury</strong> because Tom was &quot;burned&quot; when the saw caught on fire. And Tom had <strong>privity of contract</strong> because he was a &quot;purchaser.&quot;</p>
<p>Therefore, Tom can recover under a breach of warranty theory.  </p>
<p>3. BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY?</p>
<p>Under tort law, there is a BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY if a product is<strong> unsafe for ordinary use or for the buyer's known intended use</strong>, the <strong>buyer relies on the expertise of the seller</strong>, and the buyer is injured as a result. The seller is liable to foreseeable plaintiffs, those with privity of contract or their family.</p>
<p>Here Tom would argue he bought the saw for ordinary use, relied on Sam's expertise, and was injured as a result. Sam might argue that he did not know what Tom's intended use was, and there was no evidence Tom relied on his expertise.</p>
<p>Therefore Tom can purse recovery on a breach of implied warranty theory. </p>
<p>4. NEGLIGENCE?</p>
<p>Under a NEGLIGENCE theory, the defendant has a duty not to place&nbsp;<strong>unreasonably dangerous goods into the stream of commerce</strong>. To prevail the plaintiff must prove duty, breach, actual cause, proximate cause and damages. </p>
<p>DUTY? Under tort law a person has a duty to not put an unreasonably dangerous product into the stream of commerce. Further, a person who makes express representation about a product assumes a duty of due care to make sure they are accurate and will not create peril.</p>
<p>Here Sam owed Tom a DUTY because he was the seller of a product that posed foreseeable harm.</p>
<p>BREACH? Sam BREACHED his duty because he &quot;never read the owner's manual&quot; and mirepresented the saw.</p>
<p>CAUSATION? That was the ACTUAL CAUSE of his injury because he would not have been hurt if he did not buy the saw. This was also the PROXIMATE CAUSE of injury beccause it was the direct and foreseeable result.</p>
<p>DAMAGES? Tom had INJURY because he was &quot;burned.&quot;</p>
<p>Therefore, Tom could recover on a negligence theory.    </p>
<p>5. STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY? </p>
<p>Under tort law,<strong> commercial seller </strong>of a product is strictly liable for<strong> personal injury</strong> or <strong>property damage</strong> if the product is <strong>unreasonably dangerous </strong>at the time it leaves the seller. The seller is liable to any person who is injured as a result. </p>
<p>Here Sam was a <strong>commercial seller</strong> because he had a store, the &quot;Bargain Center&quot;, selling the product. And the product was <strong>unreasonably dangerous</strong> because it &quot;burst into flames&quot; in normal use and had &quot;no warnings on the saw.&quot; This caused Tom injury because he was &quot;burned.&quot;</p>
<p>Therefore, Tom can recover under strict product liability.  </p>
<p>B. DICK V SAM</p>
<p>6. BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY?</p>
<p>Breach of Express Warranty is defined above.</p>
<p>Here Dick cannot recover under breach of express warranty because Sam only said he was an &quot;expert&quot; and &quot;recommended&quot; the saw. These are not express misrepresentations.</p>
<p>7. BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY?</p>
<p>Breach of implied warranty is defined above.</p>
<p>Here <strong>Dick relied on Sam's expertise</strong> because Dick said he &quot;didn't know&quot; about saws and Sam said he was an &quot;expert&quot;. And Sam knew Dicks intended use of the saw because he said he wanted to cut &quot;24&quot; trees&quot;. Further, the saw was<strong> not safe</strong> because it could only cut 18&quot; logs, and this <strong>caused injury</strong> because the saw &quot;caught fire&quot; and Dick was &quot;burned&quot;.</p>
<p>Therefore, Dick can recover under breach of implied warranty.</p>
<p>8. NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY? </p>
<p>Dick's rights under negligence or strict product liability are the same as Tom's.</p>
<p>C. HARRY V SAM </p>
<p>9. BREACH OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY?</p>
<p>Breach of Warranty is explained above.</p>
<p>Here Harry did not buy the saw from Sam so there is <strong>no privity of contract</strong> between them and Harry was<strong> not a foreseeable plaintiff </strong>to Sam. Further, Sam made<strong> no express or implied representations</strong> to Harry.</p>
<p>Therefore, Harry cannot recover based on breach of warranty.</p>
<p>10. NEGLIGENCE?</p>
<p>Negligence is defined above.</p>
<p>It is not clear that Sam was the PROXIMATE CAUSE of the injury to Harry because Moe's act of throwing the saw in the garbage appears to be an interceding event that breaks the chain of causation.</p>
<p>Therefore, Harry's injury might be too remote in place and causation for recovery on a negligence theory.</p>
<p>11. STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY? </p>
<p>Strict Product Liability is defined above.</p>
<p>Here Sam would argue that even though he originally put the saw into the stream of commerce, it was TAKEN OUT OF THE STREAM OF COMMERCE because Moe threw it in the &quot;garbage&quot;.</p>
<p>Further, he would argue that Harray ASSUMED THE RISKS the saw was defective when he took it out of the garbage.</p>
<p>Therefore, Harry might not be able to recover under strict product liability.</p>
