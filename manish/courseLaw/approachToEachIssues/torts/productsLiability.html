<p>Products Liability</p>
<p>How to write a Essay (simple)</p>
<p>Under tort law, anyone who RELEASES an&nbsp;<strong>UNREASONABLY DANGEROUS</strong>&nbsp;product into the STREAM OF COMMERCE is liable for&nbsp;<strong>PERSONAL INJURY</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>PROPERTY DAMAGE CAUSED</strong>. A product is UNREASONABLY DANGEROUS if the<strong>&nbsp;dangers it poses</strong>&nbsp;outweigh its&nbsp;<strong>utility&nbsp;</strong>given the&nbsp;<strong>commercial practicality </strong>for making it&nbsp;<strong>safer, without destroying its utility</strong>.</p>
<p>Liability may be established based on any of four theories: 1) BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY, 2) BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY, 3) NEGLIGENCE or 4) STRICT LIABILITY IN TORT.</p>
<p>Under a BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY theory, the plaintiff must show the defendant sold goods with&nbsp;<strong>express representations</strong>&nbsp;(express warranty) which made them unreasonably dangerous, and that it was the actual and proximate cause of injury to the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Further, under a BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY theory the plaintiff must show the defendant sold goods by representing they were&nbsp;<strong>safe for ordinary use</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>knowing the buyer's specific intended use</strong>&nbsp;(implied warranty), the goods were unreasonably dangerous for that use, and that it was the actual and proximate cause of injury to the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Under a NEGLIGENCE theory, the defendant has a duty not to place&nbsp;<strong>unreasonably dangerous goods into the stream of commerce</strong>. The plaintiff must be a foreseeable plaintiff proximately caused injury by the negligent acts of the defendant.</p>
<p>And, under a STRICT LIABILITY theory, the plaintiff must show the seller was a&nbsp;<strong>COMMERCIAL SUPPLIER</strong>, the product was unreasonably dangerous at the time it left the defendant's control, and the defendant is&nbsp;<strong>only liable for non-economic damages</strong>.</p>
<p>Here&hellip; because&hellip; Therefore &hellip;</p>
<p><strong>SAMPLE ESSAY</strong></p>
<p>The Macho-X99 chainsaw is a light-duty chainsaw designed for trees no bigger than 18&quot;. In the owner's manual said in big red letters, &quot;WARNING -- NEVER TRY TO CUT DOWN A TREE BIGGER THAN 18&quot; OR THIS SAW MIGHT CATCH FIRE.&quot; There were no warnings on the saw itself. </p>
<p>Tom went into Sam's Bargain Center. Sam told him, &quot;This is the best chainsaw on the market. The Macho-X99 will cut trees up to 36&quot; in diameter.&quot; Tom bought the Macho-X99 chainsaw. </p>
<p>Dick went into Sam's Bargain Center and said he didn't know much about chainsaws but needed one that could cut a tree about 24&quot; in diameter. Sam told him, &quot;I am an expert when it comes to chainsaws. I recommend this Macho-X99.&quot; Dick bought the Macho-X99 chainsaw. </p>
<p>Moe went into Sam's Bargain Center and bought the Macho-X99 chainsaw without any discussion. </p>
<p>Sam, Tom and Dick never read the owner's manual and were unaware of the potential fire danger. When Tom and Dick tried to cut down trees bigger than 18&quot; the saws burst into flames and burned them. </p>
<p>Moe saw the warning in the owner's manual and tried to return the saw. Sam refused to give Moe his money back. Moe was disgusted and threw the saw in the garbage &ldquo;Dumpster&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Harry saw Moe's old saw in the garbage and took it. There was no owner's manual, but the saw was just like brand new. When he first used the saw it burst into flames and burned him. </p>
<p>Discuss all the theories under which Tom, Dick and Harry would seek to recover from Sam. Under which theories can they NOT recover? </p>
<p><strong>EXPLANATION</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ISSUES</strong></p>
<p>A. TOM V SAM</p>
<p>1. UNREASONABLY DANGEROUS?</p>
<p>2. BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY?</p>
<p>3. BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY?</p>
<p>4. NEGLIGENCE?</p>
<p>5. STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY?  </p>
<p>B. DICK V SAM</p>
<p>6. BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY?</p>
<p>7. BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY?</p>
<p>8. NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY? </p>
<p>C. HARRY V SAM  </p>
<p>9. BREACH OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY?</p>
<p>10. NEGLIGENCE?</p>
<p>11. STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY?   </p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>A. TOM V SAM</p>
<p>Under PRODUCT LIABILITY LAW a person who places an unreasonably dangerous product into the stream of commerce may be liable for the injury it causes. There are four basic theories on which a product liability action may be brought: Breach of Express Warranty, Breach of Implied Warranty, Negligence and Strict Liability. </p>
<p>1. UNREASONABLY DANGEROUS?</p>
<p>A product is unreasonably dangerous if it 1) poses <strong>serious and likely dangers</strong>, that 2) <strong>could be reduced or eliminated easil</strong>y, 3) <strong>without damaging product utility</strong>, or else 4) the <strong>product utility does not justify the dangers</strong> posed.</p>
<p>Here the product presented serious and likely dangers because it could burst into flame under normal use, and those dangers could have been eliminated or reduced eaisly by putting a warning on the saw.  </p>
<p>Therefore this was an unreasonably dangerous product at the time of sale. </p>
<p>2. BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY?</p>
<p>Under tort law there is a BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY if a product is sold with 1) <strong>express representations</strong> that the buyer 2) <strong>relies</strong> on and 3) the representation are <strong>incorrect</strong> and 4) it <strong>causes the purchaser injury</strong>. The seller is liable to foreseeable plaintiffs, those with privity of contract or their family. </p>
<p>Here Sam made <strong>express representations</strong> to Tom because he said the saw &quot;would cut 36&quot; trees&quot; and Tom <strong>relied</strong> because he &quot;bought&quot; the saw. This was <strong>incorrect</strong> because the saw would only cut &quot;18&quot; trees&quot;, and this caused <strong>injury</strong> because Tom was &quot;burned&quot; when the saw caught on fire. And Tom had <strong>privity of contract</strong> because he was a &quot;purchaser.&quot;</p>
<p>Therefore, Tom can recover under a breach of warranty theory.  </p>
<p>3. BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY?</p>
<p>Under tort law, there is a BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY if a product is<strong> unsafe for ordinary use or for the buyer's known intended use</strong>, the <strong>buyer relies on the expertise of the seller</strong>, and the buyer is injured as a result. The seller is liable to foreseeable plaintiffs, those with privity of contract or their family.</p>
<p>Here Tom would argue he bought the saw for ordinary use, relied on Sam's expertise, and was injured as a result. Sam might argue that he did not know what Tom's intended use was, and there was no evidence Tom relied on his expertise.</p>
<p>Therefore Tom can purse recovery on a breach of implied warranty theory. </p>
<p>4. NEGLIGENCE?</p>
<p>Under a NEGLIGENCE theory, the defendant has a duty not to place&nbsp;<strong>unreasonably dangerous goods into the stream of commerce</strong>. To prevail the plaintiff must prove duty, breach, actual cause, proximate cause and damages. </p>
<p>DUTY? Under tort law a person has a duty to not put an unreasonably dangerous product into the stream of commerce. Further, a person who makes express representation about a product assumes a duty of due care to make sure they are accurate and will not create peril.</p>
<p>Here Sam owed Tom a DUTY because he was the seller of a product that posed foreseeable harm.</p>
<p>BREACH? Sam BREACHED his duty because he &quot;never read the owner's manual&quot; and mirepresented the saw.</p>
<p>CAUSATION? That was the ACTUAL CAUSE of his injury because he would not have been hurt if he did not buy the saw. This was also the PROXIMATE CAUSE of injury beccause it was the direct and foreseeable result.</p>
<p>DAMAGES? Tom had INJURY because he was &quot;burned.&quot;</p>
<p>Therefore, Tom could recover on a negligence theory.    </p>
<p>5. STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY? </p>
<p>Under tort law,<strong> commercial seller </strong>of a product is strictly liable for<strong> personal injury</strong> or <strong>property damage</strong> if the product is <strong>unreasonably dangerous </strong>at the time it leaves the seller. The seller is liable to any person who is injured as a result. </p>
<p>Here Sam was a <strong>commercial seller</strong> because he had a store, the &quot;Bargain Center&quot;, selling the product. And the product was <strong>unreasonably dangerous</strong> because it &quot;burst into flames&quot; in normal use and had &quot;no warnings on the saw.&quot; This caused Tom injury because he was &quot;burned.&quot;</p>
<p>Therefore, Tom can recover under strict product liability.  </p>
