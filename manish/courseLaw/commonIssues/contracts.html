<p><strong>1. Does UCC apply?</strong></p>
<p>Note: Always issue #1 if UCC applies, but may be a &quot;non-issue&quot; otherwise. This is the FIRST ISSUE TO CONSIDER but&nbsp;<u>do not write about it if it is not really an issue</u>.</p>
<p>Under contract law UCC Article 2 controls <strong>contracts</strong> for the <strong>sale</strong> of <strong>GOODS</strong>. Goods are <strong>movable</strong> things at a time of <strong>identification</strong> to the contract. Otherwise only the common law controls.</p>
<p>Here the agreement was NOT (is) for a sale of goods, because ....</p>
<p>Therefore, only the common law (UCC) determines the rights of the parties here.</p>
<p><strong>2. Offer?</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law an OFFER is a manifestation of present contractual <strong>intent</strong> <strong>communicated</strong> to the offeree and sufficiently certain that an objective person would reasonably believe assent would form a bargain. Under common law an offer must specify the <strong>parties</strong>,<strong> subject matter, quantity, price, and time of performance </strong>in order to be enforceable.</p>
<p>Here the communication was (not) an offer because ...</p>
<p>Therefore, the communication was (not) an offer.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Watch out for catalogues and advertisements. Catalogues are never offers because quantity is always uncertain. Advertisements are seldom offers because either quantity is not set or else the offeree is not described. Also watch out for gift promises and exchanges of gift promises because they never manifest contractual intent. They are not enforceable at law, only at equity may be.</p>
<p><strong>OK Rule:</strong> If saying &quot;OK!&quot; to a communication would NOT make an observer reasonably believe an enforceable contract formed, then the communication &quot;assented to&quot; was not even an offer.</p>
<p><strong>For Example:&nbsp;</strong>Bevis tells Butthead, &quot;I want to sell you Blackacre for $500,000 but need two days to think about it some more&quot;. Butthead says, &quot;Ok.&quot; No observer would reasonably think a contract formed to sell the land because Bevis indicated he was uncertain. Butthead is just agreeing Bevis has two days more to &quot;think&quot; about whether he will sell the land or not.</p>
<p><strong>For Example:</strong>&nbsp;Bevis says, &quot;I won't sell Blackacre for less than $50,000&quot;. Butthead says &quot;Ok&quot;. No observer would thing a contract formed because no price was set. Bevis is just saying what he will NOT do and not saying he WILL sell the land for $50,000 or any other price.</p>
<p><strong>3. Unilateral Contract?</strong></p>
<p>Note: Skip unless the given facts make it entirely clear this is an intended issue or the offer in a GENERAL OFFER.<br />
  <br />
  Under the common law a Unilateral Contract Offer is one that unequivocally indicates <strong>acceptance</strong> can only be manifested by <strong>completion of performance </strong>by the offeree. GENERAL OFFERS, reward or bounty offers, are always unilateral contract offers.<br />
  <br />
  Here it is (not) unequivocally clear that the offeree can only accept this offer by completion of performance because ...<br />
  <br />
Therefore this is (not) a unilateral contract offer.</p>
<p><strong>4. Was the communication (action) of [date] an (implied) ACCEPTANCE?</strong></p>
<p>Note: Only for a formation question. SKIP if question says there was an agreement or contract.</p>
<p>Under the common law MIRROR IMAGE RULE an acceptance is <strong>unequivocal assent</strong> to an offer. [However, acceptance can be implied by silent performance]</p>
<p>Here the communication was (not) an acceptance because ...</p>
<p>Therefore, a CONTRACT WAS FORMED on [date]. [Or else the communication was a REJECTION AND COUNTER-OFFER on different terms.]</p>
<p>[Note: In a formation question if a contract is formed under the common law (not the UCC), it can ONLY be determined by the analysis of the offer that was accepted &ndash; that is the only thing that can determine the terms under common law. A UNILATERAL CONTRACT can only be accepted by performing the actions requested by the offeror. But modern contract law provides SAVING DOCTRINES when unilateral offers are revoked before performance is complete.]</p>
<p><strong>5. Had the OFFER LAPSED before acceptance?</strong></p>
<p>Note: This issue is frequently tested and poorly taught. Pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Under common law an offer LAPSES AND CANNOT BE ACCEPTED unless it is accepted in a<strong> reasonable period</strong> of time. Oral offers are deemed to lapse at the end of the conversation, and written offers are deemed to lapse within the timeframe implied by the means of dispatch, absent contrary agreement or implication.</p>
<p>Here the offer was oral (by fax, telegraph, mail, etc) so it would be deemed to have lapsed when ... Therefore the offer did (not) lapse before the offeree attempted to accept it.</p>
<p><strong>6. Was the communication of an EFFECTIVE ACCEPTANCE?</strong></p>
<p>Note: SKIP if question says there was an agreement or contract. This is only a possible issue if there is an &quot;acceptance&quot; by &quot;dispatch&quot; that conflicts with some communication of rejection of revocation.</p>
<p>Under the MAILBOX RULES of the common law an acceptance is effective when dispatched if dispatched in the <strong>manner specified</strong> in the offer, or by the <strong>same or faster</strong> means the offer was transmitted where the offer does not specify a means of communication.</p>
<p>Here the acceptance was (not) effective upon dispatch (receipt) because it was (not) sent by the means specified in the offer (no means was specified in the offer and it was sent at the same or faster means than the offer had been sent).</p>
<p>Therefore ....</p>
<p><strong>[Note: a&nbsp;</strong><strong>unilateral</strong><strong><u>&nbsp;contract</u>&nbsp;offer can only be accepted by the requested performance, but NEVER assume the offer is for a unilateral contract offer unless it is&nbsp;<u>unequivocal.</u>&nbsp;Further, modern contract law provides SAVING DOCTRINES as stated below.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>7. Was the communication of [date] an EFFECTIVE REJECTION?</strong></p>
<p>Note: Only for a formation question. Skip if not applicable</p>
<p>Under the MAILBOX RULES of contract law, a rejection is effective upon receipt while an acceptance may be effective upon dispatch. An EXCEPTION is made if the OFFEROR <strong>CHANGES POSITION</strong> in reliance upon a communication of rejection, not knowing that an acceptance was dispatched prior to receipt of the rejection. In that case, the rejection is effective upon receipt regardless of the fact an acceptance was also dispatched.</p>
<p>Here the rejection was (not) effective because ...</p>
<p>Here the offeror (did not) change position in reliance of the rejection because ...</p>
<p>Therefore ...</p>
<p><strong>8. Was the communication of [date] an EFFECTIVE REVOCATION?</strong></p>
<p>Note: Only for a formation question. Skip if not applicable.</p>
<p>Under the common law MAILBOX RULES revocation of a contract offer is usually effective upon receipt of the offeree, and an offer cannot be revoked after acceptance.</p>
<p>For an unequivocal unilateral offer also say, as appropriate,</p>
<p>Here the offeror was aware of the offeree had commenced the requested act because ... and the revocation was (was not) effective because...  Therefore ....</p>
<p>Under the common law, a unilateral offer could be revoked at any time. Revocation of GENERAL OFFERS, reward or bounty offers, is only effective when published in the same manner the offer was first announced.</p>
<p>Modernly SAVING DOCTRINES prevent revocation of a unilateral contract offer after the offeror is <strong>aware the offeree has commenced</strong> the requested act for a <strong>reasonable period </strong>during which the offeree must be allowed to complete the acceptance by performance.</p>
<p>Here ... Therefore....</p>
