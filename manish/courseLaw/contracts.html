<p><strong>Year October 2013</strong></p>
<p>Olivia is a florist who specializes in roses. She has a five-year
written contract with Juan to sell him as many roses as he needs for
his wedding chapel. Over the past three years, Olivia sold Juan between
300 and 1,500 dozen roses annually. Although two years remain on the
contract, Juan has just notified Olivia that he cannot continue to buy
roses from her because of serious budget concerns. <br> Last month,
Ann emailed Olivia an order for “1,000 white stems” to decorate an
event hall, specifying no particular price or flower. Ann assumed that
Olivia would send roses, her specialty, but Olivia instead sent
orchids, the only “white stems” available at the time. When Ann
received the white orchids, she was surprised, but had no time to
inquire about substitutes. As a result, she used the orchids for the
event. When Olivia subsequently billed Ann $5 per stem for the orchids,
a price twice that of roses, Ann refused to pay the higher amount. <br>
  1. What contract rights and remedies, if any, does Olivia have against Juan?  Discuss. <br>

<p><strong>Year October 2013 - 2</strong></p>
<p>County planned to make improvements on one of its roads. To that
end, on May 1, County entered into a contract with Installco containing
the following terms: County agreed to repave the road by June 1;
Installco agreed to install new guardrails, which was expected to take
three weeks, after County had completed repaving; and County agreed to
pay Installco $200,000. <br> On June 15, Installco learned that County
was far from completing the repaving of the road. It sent County an
email stating: “The June 1 start date for the installation has passed.
You knew when we signed the contract that we have another large
guardrail installation job starting on August 1 and do not have enough
equipment to do both jobs simultaneously. Please advise immediately as
to your schedule for completion of the repaving.” <br>
  On June 18, County responded with an email stating:  “We are doing our best.” <br>
On July 1, County had not yet completed the repaving of the road.
Installco received an offer to do a two-week guardrail installation job
beginning immediately. Installco sent County an email stating that it
no longer intended to perform the contract because of County’s failure
to complete repaving. <br>
On August 10, County finally completed repaving the road. It located
another company to install the guardrails, but had to pay $300,000. <br>
  1. What arguments can County reasonably make that Installco breached the contract?  Discuss. <br>
  2. What arguments can Installco reasonably make that it did not breach the contract?  Discuss. <br>
3. Who is likely to prevail?  Discuss. </p>
