<p>Sara is a doctor who collects, buys, sells, and trades baseball cards for profit, averaging 15 transactions a week. She is a recognized expert in the 1939-50 era.<br>
  Bill operates a store that regularly sells baseball cards. Bill claims he phoned Sara and offered to buy a 1939 Denny Wilson card for $550, and that Sara accepted.<br>
  Immediately after their phone conversation, Bill sent Sara an unsigned, typed letter confirming the contract, and identifying the parties, the Denny Wilson card and the price. Bill’s letter had a letterhead identifying the name of his business, Beyer’s Baseball Cards and Collectibles. The letter included the following term: “Seller shall provide a certificate of authenticity from the Baseball Trading Cards Association.” Certificates of authenticity cost $100 and significantly increase a card’s value. Sara’s card was not certified, and the parties had not discussed this before.<br>
  Sara received and read the letter but did not respond to it. When Bill called later, Sara said she had sold the card to another party for $575. Bill sued Sara for breach of contract, seeking $250 in damages (based on $800 as the fair market value of a certified card).<br>
  Sara denies the existence of a contract, alleging that Bill only asked, “Would you consider taking $550” for the card, and that she replied, “Okay, send me something in writing.” Alternatively, she claims that the phone agreement was unenforceable and that the so-called letter of confirmation had no legal effect. She also contests Bill’s calculation of damages.<br>
  1. Can Bill prevail in his lawsuit? Discuss.<br>
  2. If so, what damages, if any, is Bill entitled to recover? Discuss.</p>
