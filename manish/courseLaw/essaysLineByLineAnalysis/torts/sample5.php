<h1>Torts Sample Question 5 (Invasion of Privacy)
</h1>

<div>
      <p>The National Inkwire focused on sensational articles about celebrities, complete with candid pictures taken during private moments. Actress Ellen D. Generate was pursued relentlessly. </p>
      <p>One time The National Inkwire reported that Ellen was secretly a generous philanthropist. In fact, Ellen was a tightwad. As a result of the Inkwire article, Ellen was besieged by requests for donations, and it was professionally impossible for her to turn them all down. </p>
      <p>Then the Inkwire photographer, Dick took pictures of Ellen sunbathing topless on her sailboat. At the time the photo was taken Ellen was anchored four miles from land in international waters, and she had her friend Anne posted as a lookout to warn of any approaching boats or airplanes. The way Dick got the photo was by using a remote controlled, miniature submarine with a powerful telephoto lens. </p>
      <p>Ellen was so embarrassed by the nude photo that she remained secluded in her home for weeks. </p>
      <p>Ellen decided to sue the Inkwire, so she went to the grocery store and bought a copy of the issue with her photo to show her lawyer. Unfortunately Dick was following her and he took a picture of Ellen buying the Inkwire. Then Inkwire put the picture of Ellen on billboards nationwide with a caption that said "Ellen D. Generate buys Inkwire!" </p>
      <p>Before Ellen could file suit the Inkwire ran an interview with Ellen's old boyfriend from college. He said that even though Ellen was now a strong and vocal anti-abortion advocate, she had an abortion herself in college. This was a true fact that Ellen had told her ex-boyfriend in strictest confidence. This disclosure embarrassed Ellen and made her look like a hypocrite. </p>
      <p>Discuss the possible actions Ellen might bring against the Inkwire and their defenses. </p>

          <p>[<strong>ANSWER EXPLANATION:</strong> This question calls for discussion of each of the four Invasion of Privacy torts -- False Light, Appropriation of Likeness, Intrusion and Disclosure of Private Facts (LAID). </p>
          <p>The focus in intrusion and disclosure is on the unreasonableness of the acts of the defendant. It is not unreasonable to take a picture of a naked lady if she is lying on a public beach, but it is unreasonable to take the same picture by going to great lengths to avoid detection because it violates &ldquo;reasonable expectations of privacy&rdquo;. </p>
          <p>The term &ldquo;money damages&rdquo; generally means an award intended to compensate the plaintiff for losses suffered in terms of property damage, lost income, inconvenience, lost privacy, embarrassment, pain and suffering, etc. But the plaintiff can also request damages measured by the unjust enrichment the defendant would otherwise reap. In that case the plaintiff is said to have, &ldquo;waived the tort and sued in restitution&rdquo;, and the damage award in that case is often referred to as &ldquo;damages in restitution&rdquo;. In most cases of False Light, Intrusion and Disclosure of Private Facts the plaintiff is suing for compensatory damages, and in most cases of Appropriation of Likeness the plaintiff is suing for damages in restitution. </p>
          <p>The term &ldquo;damages&rdquo; is broadly misused to mean &ldquo;money judgment&rdquo; and students are strongly advised to get (and read) Nailing the Bar&rsquo;s Simple Remedies Outline early in their law school career.] </p>
