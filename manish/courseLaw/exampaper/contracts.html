    <td valign="top"><p>Dealer operates an antique shop.  While traveling, she buys a Union cavalry officer&rsquo;s handgun for $1,500 from Seller.  Dealer takes several photos of the handgun and Seller agrees to ship it to Dealer&rsquo;s shop.  When Dealer arrives home, she immediately shows the photos of the handgun to Buyer.  The parties shake hands on a deal to sell the handgun to Buyer for $2,000, payment upon delivery.   </p>
      <p>The next day, Buyer regrets agreeing to the deal without first having an opportunity to actually examine the handgun.  Buyer tells Dealer that he will not pay the $2,000 unless she first allows him to have the handgun examined by an expert appraiser.  Dealer becomes angry and tells Buyer, &ldquo;A deal&rsquo;s a deal.  I&rsquo;ll expect my money when the handgun is delivered to you.&rdquo; </p>
      <p>When the handgun arrives at Dealer&rsquo;s shop, she does some internet research and discovers that the handgun was issued to a general who played a prominent role at the Battle of Gettysburg, which increases the value of the handgun by a factor of ten.  The next day, Dealer receives a letter from Buyer stating, &ldquo;Sorry.  You&rsquo;re right.  A deal&rsquo;s a deal.&rdquo;  The envelope contains a check for $2,000.  Dealer sends the check back to Buyer with a note stating, &ldquo;Buyer:  Because you backed out of our deal, I will not sell you the handgun.  //Signed// Dealer.&rdquo; </p>
      <p>A few weeks later, Buyer learns that Dealer is offering the handgun for sale at her shop for $20,000 because of its connection to the Civil War general.  Buyer brings suit against Dealer for breach of contract, requesting specific performance.  </p>
      <p>1. Is Buyer likely to prevail against Dealer in his suit for breach of contract?  Discuss. </p>
    <p>2. If so, is the court likely to grant Buyer&rsquo;s request for specific performance?  Discuss </p></td>

    <td valign="top"><p>Owner wants to turn her warehouse into a restaurant.  She decides to install an innovative solar heating system, which Contractor agrees to install at a cost of $50,000.  Contractor&rsquo;s son (&ldquo;Son&rdquo;) wants to use two parking spaces in the warehouse parking lot for his (Son&rsquo;s) business.  If Owner agrees to designate two parking spaces for Son&rsquo;s use for five years, Contractor will drop the price to $35,000.   </p>
      <p>On November 13th, the parties agree to the latter arrangement in a valid written contract in which Contractor promises to start the job on November 17th and to complete it by January 1st.  The contract includes a recital stating, &ldquo;Timely performance by Contractor is important to avoid any delay in the opening of Owner&rsquo;s restaurant.&rdquo; </p>
      <p>State law requires that all installations of the new solar systems be done by a certified solar technician.  On November 15th, the only certified technician who works for Contractor, Tech, is injured in a car accident.  Contractor immediately notifies Owner and advises her that the start of the work will be delayed because of Tech&rsquo;s accident.  Owner replies, &ldquo;You know that on-time performance is crucial.  Yesterday, the city announced special tax breaks for businesses that open by the end of the year.  Can you still finish by then?&rdquo;  Contractor says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know when we can start.  It depends on how quickly Tech recovers.&rdquo;  Owner tells Contractor that she is terminating the contract.  </p>
      <p>Owner finds an alternative supplier of a similar system at a cost of $60,000, but he can&rsquo;t start work immediately and the restaurant opens in February of the following year.  Owner misses the deadline for the city tax break. </p>
      <p>Owner sues Contractor for breach of contract.  Son sues Owner for breach of contract, seeking damages for Owner&rsquo;s failure to provide the two parking spaces.   </p>
      <p>1. Can Owner prevail in her lawsuit against Contractor?  Discuss. </p>
      <p>2. If so, can Owner recover </p>
      <p>a. The $10,000 in increased costs for the heating system?  Discuss. <br />
        b. The lost profits for the delay in opening the restaurant?  Discuss. <br />
        c. The value of the tax reduction?  Discuss. </p>
      <p>3. Can Son prevail in his lawsuit against Owner?  Discuss. </p></td>
