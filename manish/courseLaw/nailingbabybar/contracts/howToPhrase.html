<strong>
<p>HOW TO PHRASE CONTRACT ANSWERS -</p>
</strong>
<p>Craft your common law contracts answer as follows: </p>
<p><strong>1. DEFINE "CONTRACT" IN AN INTRODUCTION.</strong> You must define "contract" before you can intelligently say anything about contract law. This is your <u>first task.</u></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>"The rights and remedies of the parties here depend on whether they had a valid contract. A contract is a promise or set of promises the performance of which the law will recognize as a duty and for the breach of which the law will provide a remedy. </em></p>
  <p>Some students like to add this additional sentence:</p>
  <p><em>A valid contract is based on an offer, acceptance and consideration for a legal purpose between parties of legal capacity." </em></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[The mnemonic for this is COALL = <u>C</u>onsideration, <u>O</u>ffer, <u>A</u>cceptance, <u>L</u>egal purpose, <u>L</u>egal capacity.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2. SHOW THE UCC DOES NOT APPLY (if necessary). </strong>We will discuss the UCC next week. This week we look at contacts that are not covered by the UCC. But in your <strong>common law answer </strong>your <u>second task</u> is to <strong>prove the UCC does not apply</strong>. But often this is not necessary. Consider whether the Reader wants you do do this, because otherwise it is just a waste of time.</p>
<p>The <strong>common law applies to ALL contracts.</strong> NEVER say the common law does not apply to a contract answer. But the UCC <u>modifies</u> the common law for <u>sales of goods</u> only. So the <u>first issue</u> to consider addressing is <strong>"Does the UCC apply?"</strong>  </p>
<p>The UCC does not govern if the question is NOT about 1) a <strong>sale</strong> and/or 2) it is NOT a sale of <strong>goods</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>GOODS</strong> are items that are 1) <u>movable</u> and 2) <u>identifiable to the contract</u> at the time of execution. Goods are goods no matter who sells them. Forget about <strong>MERCHANTS.</strong> The UCC governs sales of goods between non-merchants the same as it governs sales between merchants!</p>
<p>If a contract <strong>mixes goods with services the main purpose determines</strong> the proper law for your answer. For example, a contract to buy <u>carpet</u> is a contract for <u>goods</u>, even if the contract includes installation, a service. But a contract to <u>build a house</u> is a contract for a <u>service</u>, even if the contract includes lumber and other materials that are goods. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>These are sales of GOODS: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>used cars, boats, stereos, RVs for <u>sale</u></li>
      <li>firewood, harvested grain, cows</li>
      <li>"cut" flowers, "cut" Christmas trees</li>
      <li>"widgets", "gadgets" and "flibits" (if they are to be delivered)</li>
      <li>carpet, even if installation is included</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p>These are NOT SALES OF GOODS:  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>houses, land </li>
      <li>boats, cars and furniture <u>for rent</u></li>
      <li>standing crops, the <u>right to cut</u> firewood</li>
      <li>growing flowers, the <u>right to cut down</u> and take a Christmas tree</li>
      <li>stocks, bonds, contracts, copyrights, patents</li>
      <li>building structures, even if materials are included</li>
      <li><u>leased</u> equipment</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>3. DETERMINE IF THE STATUTE OF FRAUDS REQUIRES A WRITING.</strong> The Statute of Frauds is a major, major issue. Never omit discussion of it. Although the <u>sufficiency</u> of the writing is a DEFENSE issue, the <u>need</u> for a writing goes to the heart of the contract itself. Address the issue right up front. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: Some professors demand that <u>all defenses</u> be discussed after all of the plaintiff's <u>causes of action</u> have been discussed. If your professor demands that <u>humor the prof.</u> BUT in many scenarios the defenses drive the entire analysis and ignoring defenses at the beginning IS a disastrous waste of time. If an oral contract is unenforceable at LAW the only remedies of the movant are in EQUITY, and that drives the entire analysis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mnemonic for Statute of Frauds is <strong>MYLEG.</strong> Contracts must be written if they are </p>
<ul>
  <li>a contract for <u>M</u>arriage (e.g. prenuptial agreements), </li>
  <li>a contract that <u>must</u> take more than a <u>Y</u>ear to complete (from the date of execution!), </li>
  <li>a contract for conveyance of an <u>interest</u> in <u>L</u>and (e.g. rental agreements, sales, easements),</li>
  <li>a contract by an <u>E</u>xecutor of the estate of a deceased, and</li>
  <li>a contract by a <u>G</u>uarantor of a debt (remember main purpose rule!).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: some professors add "S" for "<u>S</u>ale of goods", but that makes absolutely no sense. Goods are modernly governed by the UCC 2-201. If the question involves a sale of goods, discuss UCC 2-201, and <u>don't discuss the Statute of Frauds</u>. If the question is not about goods, discuss the Statute of Frauds and <u>don't discuss goods</u>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>4. DETERMINE THE TYPE OF CONTRACT QUESTION.</strong> There are 6 basic types of contract question. Sometimes a question combines two or three of the basic types. In any essay answer you should skip issues that do not merit discussion. For more information, see the lesson at  <img src="https://www.lawtutor.org/BD21298_.gif" border="0"> <a href="https://www.lawtutor.org/LawOne/Week%204%20Files/cont_types.asp">The 6 Types of Contract Questions</a>. </p>
<p>Remember, most law-school questions <u>combine elements</u> of each of the six types. For example, FORMATION and questions usually involve a BREACH, and a BREACH usually raises the question of DEFENSES. In the end the question of REMEDIES arises. So be prepared to start with a <strong>formation analysis, </strong>move on to a <strong>breach analysis</strong> and wrap it up with a discussion of <strong>remedies</strong>.</p>
<p>The structure of your answer should be as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>A. FORMATION QUESTIONS:</strong>  Follow this pattern.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>First look at each communication <strong>chronologically </strong><u>as a separate issue</u> to see if it is an <strong>offer</strong>. </li>
    <li>Second, after you find an offer, examine each following communication <u>as a separate issue</u> looking for an <strong>acceptance</strong>. It often is a <strong>rejection and counter-offer</strong>.</li>
    <li>Watch out for and apply the <strong>mailbox rules</strong> to <strong>revocations</strong> and <strong>rejections </strong>by mail/fax.</li>
    <li>When you get a valid acceptance to a valid offer, BINGO!, you have a contract. So the <u>very</u> <u>next single issue</u> is to determine its <strong>terms</strong>. </li>
    <li>Don't discuss consideration, legal purpose or legal capacity of the parties <u>unless the facts call for discussion</u>.</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Remember that consideration is a <strong>bargained for exchange</strong>.</li>
      <li>No <strong>moral obligation.</strong> </li>
      <li>No <strong>prior consideration.</strong></li>
      <li>No promise qualified by a <strong>future decision</strong> to perform.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>B. TERMS DISPUTES:</strong> These are <strong>three situations</strong> where the parties dispute the terms. Usually there is <u>only one issue</u> and it will be one of the following: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Is the contract <strong>too uncertain</strong> to be enforced? </li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>No quantity stated? (Not a UCC <strong>requirements</strong> or <strong>production </strong>contract!)</li>
      <li>Parties uncertain? </li>
      <li>Uncertain as to time, price, subject matter? (Not UCC where<strong>gap fillers</strong> apply!)</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <ol start="2">
    <li>Is the <strong>modification</strong> supported by adequate consideration? </li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Prior obligation? </li>
      <li>This does not apply to UCC where no considerations is needed.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <ol start="3">
    <li>Does the <strong>parole evidence rule</strong> bar extrinsic evidence of additional terms?  </li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Merger clause</strong>? </li>
      <li>Contract complete within the <strong>four corners </strong>of the document?</li>
      <li>Remember the <strong>exceptions</strong> (mnemonic = DAM FOIL).</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <ol start="4">
    <li>Was <strong>timely performance</strong> an EXPRESS CONDITION (a material condition) or just a COVENANT (not a material condition)?</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>[For an explanation of express conditions versus covenants see Nailing the Bar's "Simple Contracts &amp; UCC Outline"]</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <ol start="5">
    <li>Was <strong>personal satisfaction </strong>an EXPRESS CONDITION (a material condition that the buyer must actually be satisfied) or just a COVENANT (an expression of the implied condition inherent in all contracts that performance must be "reasonably satisfactory")?</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>C. ANTICIPATORY BREACH (a.k.a. anticipatory repudiation) and WAIVER OF THE BREACH:</strong> These situations are where one party says, "I don't think I can meet the deadline." Then the other party says, "Oh yeah? Well then the deal's off."  Follow this pattern:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Look at each communication <u>as a separate issue</u> to see if it is a <strong>clear statement of intent not to perform at a future time</strong>. If a party says they don't "think" they will be able to perform in the future, that is expression of a <u>doubt</u> and not an expression of an <u>intent</u>. </li>
    <li>The <u>first party</u> to clearly state an intent to not perform is the breaching party.</li>
    <li>When a party breaches <u>the next issue</u> is the effect of the anticipatory breach. It 1) <strong>excuses</strong> the non-breaching party from performance and it 2) <strong>accelerates</strong> the performance obligation of the breaching party.</li>
    <li>The <u>next issue</u> is whether the non-breaching party <strong>waives the breach </strong>by allowing the breaching party to continue performance under the contract.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>D. DEFENSES.</strong> If there is a breach, go through each of the breaching party's defenses as <u>separate issues</u>:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>FIRST, was there an <strong>insufficient writing </strong>to satisfy the Statute of Frauds?</li>
    <li><strong>Lack of consideration</strong>? Prior obligation? Moral obligation? Prior consideration? Gift promise?</li>
    <li><strong>Illegal </strong>purpose? Does <u>in pare delicto</u> apply?</li>
    <li>Breaching party a <strong>minor</strong> or <strong>incapacitated</strong>? But, did they repudiate within time after removal of incapacity?</li>
    <li>Contract induced by <strong>fraud</strong>, <strong>duress</strong>, or because of <strong>mistake</strong>? Did the non-breaching party know, or should they have known that the other party was mistaken? </li>
    <li>Performance <strong>impossible </strong>or <strong>purpose frustrated</strong>? Was it absolutely impossible? These situations violate IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITIONS of the contract, causing it to fail.</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>[For an explanation of the IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITIONS of every contract see Nailing the Bar's "Simple Contracts &amp; UCC Outline".]</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>E. THIRD PARTY QUESTIONS.</strong> These are similar to DEFENSES and the <u>issues raised</u> are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Does the third party have <strong>standing </strong>to bring an action? Intended beneficiary?</li>
    <li>Was there an <strong>improper assignment</strong> of the contract? Notice not given?</li>
    <li>Was there an <strong>improper delegation</strong> of the contract? Personal services?</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>F. REMEDIES</strong>. Each of the remedies is a <u>separate issue</u>. Only discuss the issues that apply.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>If there was a valid contract, was there <strong>substantial performance</strong>? Benefit of bargain?</li>
    <li>Can the plaintiff obtain <strong>specific performance</strong>? Unique goods?</li>
    <li>Can the contract be <u>enforced</u> based on <strong>promissory estoppel</strong>? Injustice resulting?</li>
    <li>Can the party obtain <strong>rescission </strong>and <strong>restitution</strong>? Return to status quo?</li>
    <li>Should the damages be reduced because of a <strong>failure to mitigate</strong>?</li>
    <li>Are <strong>consequential damages</strong> called for? Cite <em>Hadley v. Baxendale,</em> and the mnemonic is <strong>CCCC</strong>.</li>
    <li>If there is NO VALID, ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT what <u>EQUITABLE</u> remedies are available to the parties? </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<strong></strong>
<p><strong>5. HOW MUCH TIME AND ANALYSIS?</strong> Follow the <strong>call of the question</strong> but otherwise spend about the same amount of time on each issue. If the call asks for discussion of <em>"rights and remedies"</em> be sure to spend some time discussing the <strong>remedies!</strong> </p>
<strong>
<p>6. PHRASE ISSUES FOR CONTRACT QUESTIONS AS FOLLOWS:</p>
</strong>
<p>I like to see issues spelled out completely but your professor might not.</p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <em><u>
      <li>Does the UCC govern?</li>
      <li>STATUTE OF FRAUDS require a writing?</li>
      <li>Letter of 5/1 an OFFER by Bob?</li>
      <li>Letter of 6/1 an OFFER by Sam?</li>
      <li>Letter of 7/1 a REJECTION AND COUNTEROFFER by Bob?</li>
      <li>Letter of 7/1 an ACCEPTANCE by Sam?</li>
      <li>TERMS of the agreement?</li>
      <li>PAROLE EVIDENCE RULE?</li>
      <li>MODIFICATION WITHOUT CONSIDERATION?</li>
      <li>ANTICIPATORY BREACH?</li>
      <li>BREACH?</li>
      <li>Duty to MITIGATE?</li>
      <li>WRITING satisfied?</li>
      <li>SUBSTANTIAL PERFORMANCE?</li>
      <li>SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE?</li>
      </u></em>
  </ol>
</ol>
<em><u></u></em>
<p>You must make it clear just what you think the issue is. For example, if there are multiple communications going back and forth between the parties and your issue is stated only as "OFFER?" how will the reader know which communication you mean?</p>
