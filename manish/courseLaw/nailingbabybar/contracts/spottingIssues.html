<strong>
<p>AN ISSUE SPOTTING EXAMPLE:</p>
</strong>
<blockquote><strong></strong>
  <p><strong>Example 1: </strong><em>"Al and Bob had an oral contract. Al was to build a house for Bob. They thought it would take about 18 months to complete. Bob agreed to pay Al each time Al gave him proof that all workmen and suppliers that had lien rights against the job had been properly paid.</em></p>
  <em>
    <p>To make his payroll Al entered into a separate agreement with Carl. Carl agreed to advance Al enough money to pay his workmen and suppliers each week. Al agreed that each time he got paid by Bob he would immediately reimburse Carl. The agreement said, "The Al-Bob contract is security for this agreement."</p>
    <p>Every week Al gave Bob proof that his workmen and material suppliers had been paid. But Bob insisted on proof that Al was also paying his ex-wife child support. Bob refused to pay on that basis. Al objected that this was not a debt that produced "lien rights", but Bob was adamant.</p>
    <p>Al was offended by Bob's demand and never gave him any documents about child support. He didn't get paid by Bob, but he still kept building the house. Al demanded continued funding from Carl.</p>
    <p>What are C's rights against B? Against A?"</p>
  </em><strong></strong>
  <p><strong>Issues:</strong> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1) WHAT LAW? Common law because it is not <u>sale</u> of goods -- not movable.</p>
    <p>2) STATUTE OF FRAUDS because it says "oral" agreement about a "house" and that it might take "eighteen months". No writing is actually needed, but the "hints" in the question call for discussion.</p>
    <p>3) ASSIGNMENT because Carl is a third party. It doesn't look like he was assigned any rights under the Al-Bob contract, so does he have standing? No.</p>
    <p>4) THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY because Carl is a third party. Can he make Bob pay? Probably not.</p>
    <p>5) BREACH by Al. An implied condition of the Al-Carl contract is that Al will take reasonable steps to get payment from Bob. When Bob refused to pay, Al <u>waived</u> the breach by continuing to build. If Al fails to make Bob pay him per their contract, he is breaching an<u>implied covenant</u> of his agreement with Carl, because the security for that agreement was the "Al-Bob contract."</p>
    <p>6) REMEDIES? Carl probably has no standing against Bob. Carl can refuse to advance Al any more money, and he can probably recover amounts already advanced to Al because Al has failed to make an effort to collect from Bob.</p>
