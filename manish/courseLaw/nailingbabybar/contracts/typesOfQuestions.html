<p><strong>6 TYPES OF LAW SCHOOL CONTRACT QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<p>There are 6 basic types of contract question. A question often combines two or three of the basic types. For example, BREACH questions always raise DEFENSE issues. In any essay answer you should skip issues that do not merit discussion. The 6 basic types of contract questions are: </p>
<strong></strong>
<ol>
  <strong></strong>
  <li><strong>FORMATION QUESTIONS </strong>– These raise the question, <strong>"Did a a contract ever form?"</strong> These questions are characterized by a series of vague communications between the parties leading up to a supposed agreement. </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>DO NOT analyze formation if the question <u>tells you</u> a contract existed. </strong>If the question says a contract existed, the question is clearly NOT a formation question. If the question tells you two parties had a contract, formation is an <strong>non-issue</strong> and it is a royal WASTE OF TIME discussing offer, acceptance, consideration, etc.</p>
  <p><strong>For formation questions only</strong> go through <u>each communication</u> between the parties one-by-one addressing <u>these issues</u> in this order:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Was there a valid OFFER? [ALWAYS an issue.]
      <ul>
        <li>Was there manifestation of INTENT?</li>
        <li>Not effectively REVOKED?</li>
        <li>A GENERAL offer?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Was there an ACCEPTANCE of an offer? [ALWAYS an issue.]
      <ul>
        <li>Not REJECTED by offeree?</li>
        <li>A TIMELY acceptance? </li>
        <li>MIRROR IMAGE RULE (Common Law)?</li>
        <li>Accepted by SHIPMENT (UCC)?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>What were the TERMS of the contract? [a possible issue.]
      <ul>
        <li>Is it <u>unequivocally clear</u> the offer is for a UNILATERAL contract?</li>
        <li>Certain as to TERMS? </li>
        <li>A DIVISIBLE contract (UCC)?</li>
        <li>A PRODUCTION or REQUIREMENTS contract (UCC)? </li>
        <li>Is <u>timely performance</u> an express condition or mere covenant?</li>
        <li>Is <u>personal satisfaction</u> an express condition or is there just a promise to render <u>reasonably satisfactory</u> performance (an implied condition of every contract)?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Supported by CONSIDERATION? [Omit if not an issue; watch for MODIFICATION and ILLUSORY PROMISE problems.]</li>
    <li>Was the contract for a LEGAL PURPOSE? [Omit if not an issue.]</li>
    <li>Between parties with LEGAL CAPACITY? [Omit if not an issue; watch for MINORS.]</li>
  </ul>

  <strong></strong>
  <li><strong>TERMS</strong> <strong>DISPUTES </strong>– These raise the question, <strong>"What were the terms of the contract?"</strong> If FORMATION is in doubt, then the TERMS are probably in dispute as well. Look at the <u>total communication</u> and <u>course of dealing</u> between the parties and address these issues:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Was the agreement sufficiently CERTAIN that a court can enforce it?
      <ul>
        <li>Remember for UCC only the <u>quantity</u> and <u>parties</u> must be certain.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, were the <u>subject matter</u>, <u>time</u>, <u>price</u>, <u>quantity</u> and <u>parties</u>certain?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Was there a MODIFICATION that was ineffective because unsupported by consideration? Remember this does not apply to a UCC question!</li>
    <li>Does the PAROLE EVIDENCE RULE exclude extrinsic evidence? (Remember the mnemonic DAM FOIL!)</li>
    <li> </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
  <strong></strong>
  <li><strong>ANTICIPATORY BREACH QUESTIONS </strong>– These raise the question, <strong>"Who breached first?" </strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>Most contract questions involve some allegation of a breach. There are two kinds of breaches, either <strong>breaches in fact</strong> or <strong>anticipatory repudiation</strong>. A <strong>breach in fact </strong>means a party did not perform at the time they were supposed to perform. An <strong>anticipatory repudiation</strong> means that a party <u>clearly</u> states an <u>intent</u>or <u>inability</u> to perform at some time in the <u>future</u>.</p>
  <p>For anticipatory breach questions <u>look at each communication</u> between the parties one-by-one until you find the <u>first clear breach</u>. Remember, only one party can breach a contract at a time. Once the first party breaches, the other party CANNOT breach unless the contract is "reformed" by <strong>waiver </strong>or an <strong>accord</strong> of a good faith dispute.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Was there an ANTICIPATORY REPUDIATION -- a <u>clear statement of intent</u> not to perform a future obligation? </li>
    <li>Was there a WAIVER of the anticipatory breach? </li>
    <li>Was there an ACCORD AND SATISFACTION of a good faith dispute?</li>
    <li>Was <u>timely performance</u> an express condition or mere covenant?</li>
    <li>Was <u>personal satisfaction</u> an express condition or is there just a promise to render <u>reasonably satisfactory</u> performance (an implied condition of every contract)?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
  <strong></strong>
  <li><strong>DEFENSE QUESTIONS</strong> – These raise the following issues: </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Does the STATUTE OF FRAUDS (or UCC 2-201 in the case of a sale of goods) require a writing? 
      <ul>
        <li>Was the need for a writing satisfied?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Did the contract (or modification if not a UCC question) lack CONSIDERATION?</li>
    <li>Was the contract for an ILLEGAL purpose (or unconscionable/adhesion contract)?</li>
    <li>Was the contract <u>voidable</u> by a MINOR or other party lacking capacity?</li>
    <li>Was the contract <u>void</u> because it was the product of FRAUD or DURESS?</li>
    <li>Was the contract <u>void</u> because of mutual MISTAKE (a la <em>Peerless</em>)?</li>
    <li>Was the contract <u>void</u> because performance was IMPOSSIBLE or FRUSTRATION OF PURPOSE?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
  <strong></strong>
  <li><strong>THIRD PARTY QUESTIONS </strong>– These raise the question, <strong>"Who has the right to enforce?"</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Were there THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES?</li>
    <li>Was there a VALID ASSIGNMENT?</li>
    <li>Was there a VALID DELEGATION?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<ol start="6">
  <strong></strong>
  <li><strong>REMEDY QUESTIONS </strong>– These raise the question, <strong>"What remedy does each party have?" </strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Does a party get time to CURE (UCC)?</li>
    <li>What are the UCC remedies (COVER, REJECT, etc.)?</li>
    <li>Did the non-breaching party FAIL TO MITIGATE damages?</li>
    <li>Was there SUBSTANTIAL PERFORMANCE (a MINOR breach) or a MAJOR breach?</li>
    <li>Can a party obtain SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE?</li>
    <li>Can the non breaching party get CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (LOST PROFITS)?
      <ul>
        <li>Cite <em>Hadley v. Baxendale.</em></li>
        <li>Remember the mnemonic <strong>CCCC</strong>.</li>
        <li>Were lost profits <strong>Contemplated</strong> by the parties at time of execution?</li>
        <li>Were lost profits <strong>Caused</strong> by the breach?</li>
        <li>Were lost profits <strong>Certain</strong> as to amount?</li>
        <li>Was the lost profit something that <strong>Couldn't</strong> be avoided.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Do the SAVING DOCTRINES of the unilateral contract apply?</li>
    <li>If there is NO VALID ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT can the parties obtain EQUITABLE relief?</li>
    <li>Can promises be enforced based on ESTOPPEL?</li>
  </ul>
