    <p>An INTENTIONAL ACT is one done for<strong> the purpose</strong> of causing or <strong>with knowledge</strong> with reasonable certainity that it <strong>will cause the result</strong> that produces injury.</p>
    <p>[Always state this in your discussion of the first intentional tort. For TORT an act is intentional if it is done for the PURPOSE of producing a RESULT, or if the actors knows that result will almost certainly occur! But the result does not necessarily have to be injury. All the matters is that the result causes Injury.]</p></td>

    <p>Further, under the PINKERTON'S RULE, a member of a conspiracy is VICARIOUSLY LIABLE for the criminal acts of co-conspirators done WITHIN THE SCOPE of the conspiracy goal. This means crimes that were 1) <strong>foreseeable</strong> and 2) <strong>in furtherance</strong> of the conspiracy goal.</p>
    <p>Even if the illegal goal of the conspiracy is attained, the CONSPIRACY DOES NOT MERGE into the criminal result, so each member can be convicted of both conspiracy and the other crimes committed during and within the scope of the conspiracy.</p>
    <p>[State the next paragraph if the conspiracy is to commit a crime that necessarily requires more than two people. <strong>Receiving stolen property</strong> is one of those crimes.]</p>
    <p>And under the WHARTON RULE, a conspiray requires the participation of more people than the minimum number necessary to commit the criminal act.</p>
    <p>[State the next paragraph if a defendant joins a conspiracy in progress]</p>
    <p>If a defendant joins a conspiracy in progress most Courts hold they are not liable for previous crimes of the co-conspirators unless the joining defendant seeks to profit from those prior crimes.</p>
    <p>[State the next sentence when crimes are committed after the conspiracy ends]</p>
    <p>A conspiracy ends when the conspiracy goal is ATTAINED or ABANDONED, and vicarious liability will no longer attach based on conspiracy theory. But it may still attach based on accomplice theory.</p></td>

<p><strong>When You Don't know the issue?</strong></p>
<p><strong>For Example</strong>: Putting this all together, suppose you are presented with some dispute that raises an issue that you have never seen before and don't know the law at all. You have to fake it. A good approach is to say, "The Courts have been split on this issue. The Court would balance the interests of the parties in light of the public interest and the Court's own interest considering the impact on the efficient administration of justice. The decision would depend on the reasonable expectations of each party in light of the reasonable needs of third parties and the impact on the Court. Here the reasonable expectation of .... And a reasonable person would believe... And it was reasonably foreseeable that... Therefore..."</p>
