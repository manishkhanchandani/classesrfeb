    <td valign="top"><p>Al had bought a lot of clothes over the years. One day he called tailor Bob and asked him to custom make him a tuxedo to wear to the wedding of his daughter Carla the next Sunday. </p>
          <p>Bob told Al that he could not make a tuxedo so fast and suggested instead that Al buy a ready- made tuxedo that he had in stock in exactly Al's size. Al agreed and said he would be in to pick it up later that week. Price was not discussed. </p>
          <p>Bob sent Al a note several days later stating, &quot;This is to confirm your order to purchase the tuxedo. The price is normally $750, but for you the price is only $519.95.&quot; </p>
          <p>Al was shocked at the price, but it was too late for him to get a tuxedo anywhere else on such short notice. He felt he had been taken advantage of, but there was nothing he could do. </p>
          <p>Al came in and tried the tuxedo on the day before the wedding and it did not fit. Bob assured him not to worry. He would take it in. Al nodded. </p>
          <p>Bob took in the pants and sent Al a note that said, &quot;I took in the pants and it should fit you like a glove. With alterations the price is now $750. </p>
          <p>Al was furious. </p>
          <p>Carla's wedding was suddenly called off. Al never called Bob and never went to get the tuxedo. Bob was furious. </p>
    <p>Does Bob have a right to be paid for the tuxedo? What are Al's defenses? </p></td>

    <td valign="top"><p>When Al was in high school he wrote and copyrighted a rap song called &quot;Dumb and Dead.&quot; He submitted his song to talent agent Tom. On January 1, two days before his seventeenth birthday, he and Tom reached a valid oral agreement that Tom could have exclusive recording rights until Al was 18 years old. Tom was to receive 25 percent of &quot;sales.&quot; </p>
          <p>Tom sent Al a signed, written &quot;sales confirmation&quot; of their agreement that gave all of the details of the agreement. The memo pointed out that records are &quot;goods&quot; under the UCC. After this Al performed completely under the terms of the agreement. </p>
          <p>Tom pitched Al's song to Deccra Records telling them Al was 19 years old, an adult. Following negotiations by Tom, Deccra and Al signed a written agreement on March 1 that Al would receive 50 percent of gross record sales over the next three years. Deccra was aware that Tom would receive a portion of this money under his contract with Al. </p>
          <p>Before Deccra paid anything it discovered Al was only 17. A Deccra executive secretly met with Al and told him the company would not stand by its first agreement, and an alternative agreement was proposed that would benefit both parties. Al agreed on April 1 to a new arrangement under which he got 40 percent of gross record sales, Deccra got 60 percent and Tom was cut completely out. </p>
          <p>The song went straight to the top of the charts and Deccra's sales were $1.6 million in the next year. Of this amount Deccra paid Al $640,000, 40 percent of gross sales. Deccra's distribution expenses were $360,000, and it made profits of $600,000. Tom got nothing. </p>
          <p>Tom got a lawyer and sued both Al and Deccra. </p>
          <p>Al also went to a lawyer. Six months after becoming an adult on his eighteenth birthday he sued Deccra claiming he was a minor when the contract was signed. He demanded return of all remaining revenues, $960,000. </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>1) &nbsp;Was the contract of January 1 unenforceable by Tom because it was oral? </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>2) &nbsp;Was the contract of January 1 enforceable against Tom by Al? </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>3) &nbsp;Was the contract of March 1 enforceable by Al against Deccra? </p>

          <p>Homeowner Homer orally agreed with builder Bill that he would pay Bill $100,000 to have a custom built home erected on the land that Homer already owned. They agreed the home was to be done before the winter rains set in. </p>
          <p>When Bill was half done building, he discovered he had terminal cancer and would only live a few weeks. </p>
          <p>Bill told Homer his medical expenses were so high he needed $30,000 more in order to hire a helper or it would be impossible for him to finish the home in time. Homer offered to pay Bill the extra $30,000 this would take because he was tired of living in a tent. </p>
          <p>In reasonable reliance on Homer&rsquo;s promise, Bill hired his friend, Fred, and paid Fred wages of $30,000. </p>

          <p>Wanda demanded payment of $130,000, but Homer was mad and refused to pay anything. Homer paid painter Paul $10,000 to finish the painting of the home.<br/>

    <td valign="top"><p>Dottie's father Fester called her one day and told her he had suffered a stroke. He was paralyzed from the scalp down. He asked her to come live with him and take care of him. He told her that if, and only if, she took care of him for the rest of his life he would leave her his entire estate in his will, including his house. He emphasized that Dottie could only accept his offer by doing what he asked, and that she could not accept by merely promising to take care of him. </p>
          <p>Dottie sold her home at a $50,000 loss and moved across the country to take care of Fester for the rest of his life. She gave up her $250,000 per year practice as a brain surgeon nursed Fester 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Similar care in a nursing home would have cost $40,000 per year. </p>
          <p>After ten years Fester suddenly said, &quot;I revoke! Get out of my house.&quot; Dottie sadly moved into a homeless shelter. </p>
          <p>A month later Fester died leaving his estate, consisting of the house and 1 million shares of Microsoft, to TV evangelist, Reverend Melvin Huckster, and his Society for the Prevention of Cat Teasing. </p>
