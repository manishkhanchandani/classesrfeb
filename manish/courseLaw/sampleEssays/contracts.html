    <td valign="top">Practice Question 16-1 </td>
    <td valign="top"><p>Lucy owned a rent house. She advertised in the newspaper to find a renter, citing rent of $700 a month. </p>
          <p>Homer saw the ad and called Lucy at 9:00 a.m. Homer said, &ldquo;&quot;I saw your ad and accept your offer! I will be right there to pay you. I have to see the house, but would you consider $550?&rdquo; </p>
          <p>Lucy said, &ldquo;It's a deal. I will rent to you for $550. This is a firm offer.&rdquo; Homer said he would be there in one hour to see the house. </p>
          <p>Homer went 100 miles an hour to see the house, sideswiping Victoria. Victoria crashed and died along with her 7-month fetus. </p>
          <p>At 3:00 p.m. Homer arrived, five hours late, ran up to Lucy and said, &ldquo;I unequivocally accept. Here is my $550.&rdquo; </p>
          <p>Lucy said, &ldquo;I have decided not to rent to you.&rdquo; Discuss the rights of Homer and Lucy's defenses. </p></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>Chapter: <strong>Contract Formation</strong></p>
      <p>Homer Vs Lucy</p>
      <ol>
        <li>UCC?</li>
        <li>Writing Required?</li>
        <li>Advertisement - Offer?</li>
        <li>Was the 9.00 statement by Homer an OFFER </li>
        <li>Was the 9.00 by Lucy an OFFER</li>
        <li>Did Homer have a valid OPTION?</li>
        <li>Did Homer effectively ACCEPT at 3.00?  </li>
      </ol>
      <p>[Explanation: This question is a typical FORMATION question because it goes through a series of communications between the parties. When you see messages going back and forth, it is a FORMATION question, so analyze each message.</p>
      <p>Start with an INTRODUCTORY DEFINITION of a contract. Then chronologically analyze each communication to see if it is an OFFER. Once there is an offer, the next issue is whether the offer is ACCEPTED.</p>
      <p>If there is offer and an acceptance a contract forms and the next issue is the TERMS of the contract.</p>
      <p>After the contract terms are discussed the next issue is whether there has been a BREACH. And if there is a berach, the issues are WHO BREACHED and the REMEDIES of the parties.]  </p></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>HOMER VS LUCY</p>
    <p>The rights and remedies of the parties depend on whether or not there was a valid contract. A contract is a promise or set of promises the performance of which the law will recognize as a duty and for which the law will provide a remedy.  </p>
    <p>1. UCC?</p>
    <p>UCC Article 2 governs contracts for <strong>sale</strong> of GOODS, <strong>movable</strong> things at the time of identification to the contract. Otherwise, only COMMON LAW governs the contract.  </p>
    <p>Here the contract does not concern a <strong>sale</strong> of <strong>movable things </strong>because it is for the &quot;rent&quot; of a &quot;house&quot;. </p>
    <p>Therefore, only COMMON LAW principles govern this contract.</p>
    <p>2. Is a WRITING REQUIRED?</p>
    <p>Under the STATUTE OF FRAUDS certain types of contract must be in writing to be enforced. A contract for conveyance of an interest in LAND often requires a writing, but not leaseholds of a year or less.</p>
    <p>Here the question involves conveyance of an interest in land because the alleged agreement was to rent a &quot;house&quot;, but this appears to be a month-month rental.</p>
    <p>Therefore, a writing would not generally be required.    </p>
    <p>3. Was the ADVERTISEMENT an OFFER?</p>
    <p>Under contract law an OFFER is a <strong>manifestation of present intent </strong>to enter into a bargain <strong>communicated</strong> to the offeree and sufficiently specific that an observer would reasonably believe assent would form a bargain. Advertisements are generally not offers because they usually fail to identity the parties or the quantity being offered. </p>
    <p>Here the advertisement was <strong>not specific</strong> as to the parties because it did not guarantee that Lucy would rent to the first person to respond. </p>
    <p>Therefore, the advertisement was not an offer. </p>
    <p>4. Was the 9:00 statement by Homer an OFFER?</p>
    <p>Offer is defined supra</p>
    <p>Here the statement by Homer did not appear to <strong>manifest intent</strong> to enter into a bargain because  even though he said, &quot;I accept&quot; he added that he &quot;had to see the house first&quot;. No reasonable person would believe assent to that statement would form a bargain because it was clear he wanted to &quot;see the house first&quot;. </p>
    <p>Therefore the statement was not an offer.  </p>
    <p>5. Was the 9.00 response by Lucy an OFFER?</p>
    <p>Offer is defined supra</p>
    <p>Here the statement by Lucy did  manifest intent to enter into a bargain because she said &quot;It's a deal, I will rent to you for $550.&quot; A reaonable person would believe assent to that statment  would form a bargain.</p>
    <p>Therefore that statement was an offer.</p>
    <p>6. Did Homer have a valid OPTION?</p>
    <p>Offer is defined supra. Under common law an OPTION is a contractual agreement that an offeror will not revoke an offer for a specific period of time <strong>in exchange for CONSIDERATION from the offeree</strong>. CONSIDERATION is an <strong>exchange</strong> of promises posing <strong>legal detriment</strong> such that the law deems it sufficient to support an agreement.   </p>
    <p>Here Lucy promised to give a &quot;firm offer&quot;, but Homer <strong>gave no promise or value in exchange</strong>. While the UCC provides for &quot;firm offers&quot; from merchants, the UCC does not govern here. Therefore, Lucy received no legal consideration in exchange for her promise to give a &quot;firm offer&quot; and her promise cannot be enforced against her as an option contract.</p>
    <p>Therefore, Lucy's offer did not create an option contract, and she could revoke her offer at any time.</p>
    <p>7. Did Homer effectively ACCEPT at 3.00?</p>
    <p>At common law an acceptance must be an<strong> unequivocal assent </strong>to the <strong>terms</strong> of an offer, dispatched to the offeror in the manner required, or if no manner is required in the offer, by the means by which the offer <strong>was dispatched</strong> or some <strong>faster</strong> means. An offer must be accepted before it <strong>LAPSES</strong>. Unless there is an option, an offer lapses in the time stated or if no <strong>time stated</strong> within a <strong>reasonable time </strong>after the offer is made.   </p>
    <p>Here the reasonable time for acceptance of Lucy's offer is defined by the understanding that Homer would view the house in only one hour at &quot;10:00&quot;. That understanding established the &quot;reasonable time&quot; within which Homer could accept the offer. But Homer was &quot;five hours late,&quot; as Lucy's offer had already lapsed when he arrived. Homer's attempt to unequivocally accept Lucy's 9:00 offer by saying &quot;I unequivocally accept&quot; was ineffective because he could not accept an offer that had already lapsed.</p>
    <p>Therefore, Homer's attempt to accept was ineffective. </p></td>

    <td valign="top"><p>Al had bought a lot of clothes over the years. One day he called tailor Bob and asked him to custom make him a tuxedo to wear to the wedding of his daughter Carla the next Sunday. </p>
          <p>Bob told Al that he could not make a tuxedo so fast and suggested instead that Al buy a ready- made tuxedo that he had in stock in exactly Al's size. Al agreed and said he would be in to pick it up later that week. Price was not discussed. </p>
          <p>Bob sent Al a note several days later stating, &quot;This is to confirm your order to purchase the tuxedo. The price is normally $750, but for you the price is only $519.95.&quot; </p>
          <p>Al was shocked at the price, but it was too late for him to get a tuxedo anywhere else on such short notice. He felt he had been taken advantage of, but there was nothing he could do. </p>
          <p>Al came in and tried the tuxedo on the day before the wedding and it did not fit. Bob assured him not to worry. He would take it in. Al nodded. </p>
          <p>Bob took in the pants and sent Al a note that said, &quot;I took in the pants and it should fit you like a glove. With alterations the price is now $750. </p>
          <p>Al was furious. </p>
          <p>Carla's wedding was suddenly called off. Al never called Bob and never went to get the tuxedo. Bob was furious. </p>
    <p>Does Bob have a right to be paid for the tuxedo? What are Al's defenses? </p></td>
    <td valign="top"><p>Chapter: UCC and Acceptance Varying Terms</p>
    <p>BOB VS AL</p>
    <ol>
      <li>UCC?</li>
      <li>Merchants?</li>
      <li>Is a Writing Needed?</li>
      <li>Did Bob Offer to sell the tuxedo?</li>
      <li>Did Al Accept Bob's offer?</li>
      <li>What were the terms of the bargain?</li>
      <li>Breach?</li>
      <li>Can Al raise the Lack of writing as a defense?</li>
      <li>Frutration of purpose?</li>
      </ol>
    <p>[Explanation: This is a UCC question, obviously. Bob breached by delivering non-conforming goods that failed to provide a perfect fit, as promised. But he has time to cure, and gave notice he intended to cure.</p>
    <p>If Al wants out of the deal, he can claim a lack of writing. He can do that because he is not a merchant, and the &quot;sale confirmation&quot; does not apply to him. He would be a merchant if he were a collector or hobbyist. But just buying lots of clothes doesn't make him a merchant any more than you are a merchant because you have bought a lot of groceries.</p>
    <p>And Al also possibly can claim frustration of purpose.] </p></td>

    <td valign="top"><p>When Al was in high school he wrote and copyrighted a rap song called &quot;Dumb and Dead.&quot; He submitted his song to talent agent Tom. On January 1, two days before his seventeenth birthday, he and Tom reached a valid oral agreement that Tom could have exclusive recording rights until Al was 18 years old. Tom was to receive 25 percent of &quot;sales.&quot; </p>
          <p>Tom sent Al a signed, written &quot;sales confirmation&quot; of their agreement that gave all of the details of the agreement. The memo pointed out that records are &quot;goods&quot; under the UCC. After this Al performed completely under the terms of the agreement. </p>
          <p>Tom pitched Al's song to Deccra Records telling them Al was 19 years old, an adult. Following negotiations by Tom, Deccra and Al signed a written agreement on March 1 that Al would receive 50 percent of gross record sales over the next three years. Deccra was aware that Tom would receive a portion of this money under his contract with Al. </p>
          <p>Before Deccra paid anything it discovered Al was only 17. A Deccra executive secretly met with Al and told him the company would not stand by its first agreement, and an alternative agreement was proposed that would benefit both parties. Al agreed on April 1 to a new arrangement under which he got 40 percent of gross record sales, Deccra got 60 percent and Tom was cut completely out. </p>
          <p>The song went straight to the top of the charts and Deccra's sales were $1.6 million in the next year. Of this amount Deccra paid Al $640,000, 40 percent of gross sales. Deccra's distribution expenses were $360,000, and it made profits of $600,000. Tom got nothing. </p>
          <p>Tom got a lawyer and sued both Al and Deccra. </p>
          <p>Al also went to a lawyer. Six months after becoming an adult on his eighteenth birthday he sued Deccra claiming he was a minor when the contract was signed. He demanded return of all remaining revenues, $960,000. </p>
