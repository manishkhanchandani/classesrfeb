          <p>Tom and Dick burst into the 7-11 store in Sacramento through the open door with their guns drawn at midnight. They wanted to rob the store the first night it opened. </p>
          <p>&ldquo;Stick &lsquo;em up,&rdquo; yelled Tom. </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the store was empty because they made a big mistake. No one was there. There was no merchandise. The store wasn&rsquo;t going to open until the next week. </p>
          <p>They were so mad they ripped the security camera off the wall and threw it in the river. </p>
          <p>The next morning Tom and Dick saw themselves on the Dumb Crook Show on TV. The store security camera had filled them trying to rob the empty store. They were afraid they would be caught. So to escape Tom drove real fast to San Francisco with Dick as his passenger. </p>
          <p>One the freeway going 75 mph, Tom was distracted and accidentally bumped Victoria&rsquo;s car. She was only going 70 mph, the posted limit. She spun out of control and crashed. She survived, but went into labor, and her full-term, viable baby was born dead. </p>
          <p>Tom then got off the freeway and drove down the crowded city surface streets of San Francisco at 80 mph. Dick was silent. The posted limit was 25 miles per hour. The car ran over homeless person Victor. He died instantly. </p>
          <p>Discuss the possible charges against Tom and Dick. </p>

    <td valign="top"><p><strong>Attempt, Homicide, Res Gestae, Depraved Heart</strong></p>
      <p>STATE V. TOM</p>
      <p>1. CONSPIRACY?</p>
      <p>Under common law, a CONSPIRACY is an&nbsp;<strong>agreement</strong>&nbsp;between<strong>&nbsp;two or more people</strong>&nbsp;to work toward an<strong>&nbsp;illegal goal</strong>. Modernly an overt step toward the criminal goal is often required. Conspiracy does not merge into ultimate crime.</p>
      <p>Here there was an implied&nbsp;<strong>agreement</strong>&nbsp;between Tom and Dick, two people, for an<strong>&nbsp;illegal goal&nbsp;</strong>because they &quot;burst&quot; into the store together and &quot;wanted to rob&quot; the store. They committed an&nbsp;<strong>overt step</strong>&nbsp;toward their goal because of this.</p>
    <p>Therefore Tom can be charged with conspiracy.</p>
    <p>2. ATTEMPTED ROBBERY?</p>
    <p>Under&nbsp;criminal&nbsp;law an ATTEMPTED ROBBERY is committed with there is a&nbsp;<strong>SUBSTANTIAL STEP</strong>&nbsp;taken toward committing a robbery. A robbery is a LARCENY, a&nbsp;<strong>trespassory&nbsp;taking of personal property</strong>&nbsp;with an<strong>&nbsp;intent to permanently deprive</strong>, from a&nbsp;<strong>person by force or fear&nbsp;</strong>overcoming the will of the victom to resist.</p>
    <p>Here Tom took a&nbsp;<strong>SUBSTANTIAL STEP</strong>&nbsp;toward completing the robbery because he went to the store &quot;with a gun&quot; and &quot;burst&quot; through&nbsp;the door. And his goal was the crime of robbery because he &quot;wanted to rob&quot; the store.</p>
    <p>Therefore, Tom can be charged with attempted robbery.</p>
    <p>3. DEFENSE OF MISTAKE OF FACT?</p>
    <p>Under&nbsp;criminal&nbsp;law&nbsp;a mistake of fact is a valid defense if it NEGATES IMPLIED CRIMINAL INTENT.&nbsp;Attempt&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<strong>SPECIFIC INTENT</strong>&nbsp;crime, so any mistake of fact that negates criminal intent is a valid defense.</p>
    <p>Here Tom made a mistake because he thought the store was open for business, but that mistake does not negate intent because he &quot;wanted to rob&quot; the store.</p>
    <p>Therefore, Tom's mistake of fact does not negate his criminal intent, and his defense argument fails.</p>
    <p>4. BURGLARY?</p>
    <p>Under the common law a burglary was a breaking and entering of the dwelling of another in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony. Further, a CONSTRUCTIVE BREAKING would be found if an entry was made by trick, threat of violence or with the help of a conspiratory. MODERNLY burglary has been extended to almost any structure and all times of the day. If a larceny is not a felony, it still supports a charge of burglary. And modernly a constructive breaking will be found if there is any TRESSPASSORY ENTRY, an entry without permission, express or implied.</p>
    <p>Here there was no entry to a dwelling, and the entry was through an &quot;open&quot; door. Therefore, no common law burglary occured. But there was an entry to a <strong>structure</strong> because they entered a &quot;store&quot; and it was with <strong>intent to commit a felony</strong> because they &quot;wanted to rob&quot; the store. Finally, a CONSTRUCTIVE BREAKING would be found modernly because their entry was <strong>trespassory</strong>. It was tresspassory because the store was not open for business, and they had no permission to enter it, either expressly or impliedly. </p>
    <p>Therefore they could be charged with burglary modernly but could not have been charged at common law. </p>
    <p>5. LARCENY?</p>
    <p>Under common law LARCENY was the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent of the personal property of another with intent to permanently deprive. Modernly it is codified as &quot;theft&quot;.</p>
    <p>At common law some Courts held that property attached to the land could not be the subject of a larceny because it was real property and not personal property. Other courts diagreed, and modernly all courts would hold that when property is severed from the land to be stolen it is transformed from real property and can then be the subject of a larceny.</p>
    <p>Here Tom <strong>took and carried personal property of another</strong> because he &quot;ripped the security camera&quot; from the wall and took it to the &quot;river&quot;, and he <strong>intended to permanently deprive</strong> because he threw it in the river.</p>
    <p>Therefore Tom can be charged with larceny.    </p>

          <p>Huey and Louie agreed to kidnap Frank's daughter, Millie, and hold her for ransom. Frank was an old movie star with lots of money. </p>
          <p>Huey knew that Louie was a convicted rapist, so he said, &quot;Louie! I want you to swear that you won't touch this girl. Because we are just in this for the ransom. Nothing else. And if you do anything bad to her, that is going to hurt our chances to get the ransom. So, do you swear?&quot; </p>
          <p>Louie said, &quot;Huey, I swear on a stack of bibles I won't touch the dame.&quot;<br/>
            So Huey and Louie kidnapped Millie and held her for ransom in a rundown motel. </p>
          <p>Huey went to the store for smokes and when he came back he discovered Louie had sex with Millie by telling her he would let her go in exchange. He was furious and afraid. He said, &quot;Louie, I quit. I ain't having nothing to do with this no more!&quot; </p>
          <p>Huey left and went to a bar where he got very drunk. That night Millie became so despondent over allowing Louie to have intercourse with her she hung herself in the bathroom of the motel room while Louie was snoring in the bed. </p>
          <p>Police discovered where Louie was and surrounded the motel room the next morning. Louie vowed not to be taken alive and was gunned down by the cops. </p>

          <p>Tom and his lover Dick made frequent trips to Mexico. Dick was getting a little impotent, so on one trip they bought some Viagra with the intent of smuggling it into the United States. They thought this was a felony, but they were wrong. It was not a crime at all. </p>
          <p>Officer Oscar tried to pull them over solely because they looked gay, and Oscar hated gays. He intended to harass them. If he was lucky, he thought, maybe he could beat them up. Oscar had some issues to resolve, but he did not have probable cause to stop the car. </p>
          <p>Tom was afraid. He felt Oscar must somehow know he was smuggling Viagra. He thought he would be strip searched, and he had an overwhelming phobia of body cavity searches. He thought he would be put in prison and treated very badly. </p>
          <p>Tom was scared to death and could not bring himself to stop the car. He knew it was wrong, but he could not help himself. He was in a daze. </p>
          <p>Tom continued to drive carefully at 55 mph and Oscar continued to follow him. Oscar was furious. Then Oscar shot at the car several times and Dick was killed. </p>
          <p>Tom is charged with the murder of Dick.<br/>
            Discuss Tom's liability for murder and lessor included offenses, and his applicable defenses. </p>

          <p>Jim was sweet on Sue, a cute little red-haired girl in his Senior class, but she was more interested in a big, dumb, old football player named Chester. </p>
          <p>Jim thought that Sue would dump Chester for him if he was a hero. So Jim set fire to the wastepaper basket in old-lady Smith's classroom during the class break intending to report it and be a hero. He didn't intend any harm to the building, and he honestly believed the fire would not hurt the school at all. Unfortunately, the fire slightly singed the wall, and some other boys poured water on it before Jim could report it. </p>
          <p>In the confusion Sue dropped her wallet. Jim picked it up and hid it. He planned on giving it back to her that night. Then she would see he is a hero, and she would have to go to homecoming with him. </p>
          <p>Jim called Sue's house several times that night to tell her he had her wallet. But Sue's mother kept saying she was out with Chester. Jim did not tell Sue's mother about the wallet. </p>
          <p>This went on all night and Jim got so depressed he went to the river, pocketed Sue's money and threw Sue's wallet as far out into the current as he could throw. </p>
          <p>The next day Chester came up to Jim in first period and asked him a favor. Chester said the football team had to assemble for a yearbook picture, so Chester asked Jim to buy him two homecoming tickets in fifth period for Sue and him to go to the dance. Jim intended to do Chester a favor and took his $10. </p>
          <p>Jim got mad and decided he would just keep Chester's money. Then after second period Chester offered Jim $20 more so Sue and him could have their pictures taken at the dance. Jim agreed and took the money with every intention of stealing it. </p>
          <p>Jim used all of Chester's money to buy cigarettes and Playboy magazines. Discuss Jim's crimes. </p>

          <p>Yang rode his bicycle down Rodeo Drive looking for a victim. He saw a &quot;Hot Tomato&quot; ready to cross the street, and as he coasted past her he deftly lifted her wallet right out of her purse without her knowing. </p>
          <p>At the next street he snatched another purse when an &quot;Old Lady&quot; wasn't even looking. But she was holding tight and fell over into the street. As she hit the pavement she lost her grip and Yang rode away with another prize. </p>
          <p>Yang was having a good day. </p>
          <p>At the next corner Yang reached out to snag another purse. But at the last second as he reached out he realized the &quot;Young Chick&quot; was not carrying a purse. </p>
          <p>Disappointed, Yang called it a day. He decided to score some dope with his earnings. Seeing a dude near an alley, he entered into some negotiations. The dude said he could sell him a baggy of &quot;grass&quot; for $10. Yang agreed and handed over $10. Suddenly cops came out of nowhere and jumped on them before Yang got possession. It turned out the &quot;grass&quot; really was grass -- lawn clippings from the dude's back yard. </p>
          <p>What crimes can Yang be charged with and what defenses might be raised? </p>

          <p>Karen was furious because her lover Billy ran off with Mary. Karen decided to kill Mary and looked for some dynamite to blow Mary straight to Hell. </p>
          <p>Karen went to a &quot;Dynamite R Us Store&quot;, but the owner Marvin refused to sell her any dynamite. Karen pulled a gun and demanded quality service like it said on the sign in the window. Marvin said, &quot;Yes, Ma'am!&quot; and handed over 12 sticks of dynamite. Karen was happy with the service. But as she was putting away the gun, it accidentally went off and shot Marvin between the eyes. Karen felt real bad about it. </p>
          <p>As Karen approached Mary's mobile home she was stopped by Ruby. Ruby gave her a hard look. Ruby &quot;dissed&quot; her. Ruby challenged her to a spelling bee and criticized her choice of attire. That was all more than Karen could take, because she always had a short fuse. So she smoked Ruby above the ear with a round from the '38. </p>
          <p>Karen proceeded to put the dynamite under Mary's double-wide &quot;Jerry Springer&quot; brand mobile home. She realized that the blast would probably kill Billy too, and she felt real bad about it. Billy was the reason she was acting out, her love for him and all. But the way she figured, a girl's got to do what a girl's got to do. So she washed that man right out of her hair. </p>
          <p>That night the blast killed both Mary and Billy. </p>
