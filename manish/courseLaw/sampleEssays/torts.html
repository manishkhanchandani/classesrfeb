          <p>Clark Kent, star reporter for the Daily Planet was approached by panhandler Bill Gates and asked for a quarter. As a prank, Kent (who was secretly Superman) lifted and very gently flew Gates hundreds of feet up to the top of the World Tribune building and left Gates there on a ledge. </p>
          <p>Kent hovered over the World Tribune building and never touched the surface of the building. During the flight Gates was apprehensive he might fall, but Kent had a strong grip. </p>
          <p>Gates was embarrassed and the crowd below taunted him for hours as the fire department tried to devise a means of rescue. Gates was humiliated. </p>
          <p>As he stood on the ledge Gates accidentally knocked a decorative panel loose. It fell to the ground and injured fireman Frank. </p>
          <p>Suddenly Gates discovered that there was an unlocked window next to him all the time. He opened the window and escaped immediately. </p>
          <p>Discuss Kent's liability to Gates, the World Tribune and fireman Frank. </p>

          <p>Tom bought some firecrackers in Rural County, where they were legal. He took them into the National Forest where federal law prohibited the possession and use of fireworks. The federal law was enacted to reduce the threat of forest fires and injury on national lands. </p>
          <p>In the National Forest Tom waded to a gravel bar in the middle of Big River, and there he carefully lit and threw the firecrackers into the air above the river. Occasionally one would fail to explode and it would fall harmlessly into the water. There was no one else around, and there was nothing on the gravel bar that could burn. </p>
          <p>Little Dick was playing a half-mile upstream from Tom, throwing sticks into Big River. He was three years old. His mother warned him to stay back from the edge of the river because it was dangerous. Dick disobeyed his mother and recklessly pushed a rotted tree into the river and it swirled away in the water. No one was hurt. </p>
          <p>Half a mile downstream from Tom, Paula was one of five people on the bridge above Big River fishing for trout. Paula was outside the National Forest boundaries. She had ignored a sign that said &quot;No Fishing From Bridge.&quot; Fishing from the bridge was prohibited for traffic safety, but she was well off the roadway and there were very few cars this time of year. Paula was sitting carelessly on the edge of the bridge, but it was a nice day, the water was only six feet below her, and she knew how to swim. </p>
          <p>Tom threw another firecracker into the air and it did not explode. Instead it fell onto the log that Dick had pushed into the river upstream. </p>
          <p>The log swept down the river for half a mile before the firecracker exploded just as the log swept under the bridge. </p>
          <p>Paula was startled and fell into the river. </p>
          <p>Other people that had been fishing rushed off the bridge and down the river bank to rescue Paula as she laughingly climbed up the bank. </p>
          <p>Harry had been fishing too, but instead of going to help Paula, he stayed on the bridge and took two dollars out of Paula's purse. No one saw Harry take the money and the crime was never solved. Paula was hurt and upset. </p>
          <p>Under what theories can Paula seek to recover from Tom and Dick and what defenses would they raise? </p>

          <p>The Macho-X99 chainsaw is a light-duty chainsaw designed for trees no bigger than 18&quot;. In the owner's manual said in big red letters, &quot;WARNING -- NEVER TRY TO CUT DOWN A TREE BIGGER THAN 18&quot; OR THIS SAW MIGHT CATCH FIRE.&quot; There were no warnings on the saw itself. </p>
          <p>Tom went into Sam's Bargain Center. Sam told him, &quot;This is the best chainsaw on the market. The Macho-X99 will cut trees up to 36&quot; in diameter.&quot; Tom bought the Macho-X99 chainsaw. </p>
          <p>Dick went into Sam's Bargain Center and said he didn't know much about chainsaws but needed one that could cut a tree about 24&quot; in diameter. Sam told him, &quot;I am an expert when it comes to chainsaws. I recommend this Macho-X99.&quot; Dick bought the Macho-X99 chainsaw. </p>
          <p>Moe went into Sam's Bargain Center and bought the Macho-X99 chainsaw without any discussion. </p>
          <p>Sam, Tom and Dick never read the owner's manual and were unaware of the potential fire danger. When Tom and Dick tried to cut down trees bigger than 18&quot; the saws burst into flames and burned them. </p>
          <p>Moe saw the warning in the owner's manual and tried to return the saw. Sam refused to give Moe his money back. Moe was disgusted and threw the saw in the garbage &ldquo;Dumpster&rdquo;. </p>
          <p>Harry saw Moe's old saw in the garbage and took it. There was no owner's manual, but the saw was just like brand new. When he first used the saw it burst into flames and burned him. </p>
          <p>Discuss all the theories under which Tom, Dick and Harry would seek to recover from Sam. Under which theories can they NOT recover? </p>

          <p>Barbara, the famous TV news lady, was assigned to do a story on former governor, Pat Wilson, to find out why Wilson had become almost a recluse in the years since he left office. </p>
          <p>Barbara interviewed Wilson at his home. Wilson's speech was slurred, his eyes were bloodshot and he was unsteady. Barbara asked him about his health, and he declined to comment. Barbara knew Wilson had once been an alcoholic, and she suspected he had begun drinking heavily again. But she did not ask him about this because she knew he would deny it. </p>
          <p>On TV Barbara accurately described Wilson's slurred speech, bloodshot eyes and unsteady gait. Then she stated, &quot;It appears that someone we once knew and respected has gone back to his old ways.&quot; She did not state who the &quot;someone&quot; was, and she did not explain what she meant by &quot;his old ways.&quot; </p>
          <p>Because of the news broadcast, rumors rapidly spread that Wilson had again developed a drinking habit. Wilson's approval in polls fell dramatically, and he was passed over for the post of State Republican Chair, but he had little chance of being selected for that post. </p>
          <p>Wilson demanded a retraction and apology, but Barbara refuses. Discuss potential action by Wilson. </p>

          <p>The National Inkwire focused on sensational articles about celebrities, complete with candid pictures taken during private moments. Actress Ellen D. Generate was pursued relentlessly. </p>
          <p>One time The National Inkwire reported that Ellen was secretly a generous philanthropist. In fact, Ellen was a tightwad. As a result of the Inkwire article, Ellen was besieged by requests for donations, and it was professionally impossible for her to turn them all down. </p>
          <p>Then the Inkwire photographer, Dick took pictures of Ellen sunbathing topless on her sailboat. At the time the photo was taken Ellen was anchored four miles from land in international waters, and she had her friend Anne posted as a lookout to warn of any approaching boats or airplanes. The way Dick got the photo was by using a remote controlled, miniature submarine with a powerful telephoto lens. </p>
          <p>Ellen was so embarrassed by the nude photo that she remained secluded in her home for weeks. </p>
          <p>Ellen decided to sue the Inkwire, so she went to the grocery store and bought a copy of the issue with her photo to show her lawyer. Unfortunately Dick was following her and he took a picture of Ellen buying the Inkwire. Then Inkwire put the picture of Ellen on billboards nationwide with a caption that said &quot;Ellen D. Generate buys Inkwire!&quot; </p>
          <p>Before Ellen could file suit the Inkwire ran an interview with Ellen's old boyfriend from college. He said that even though Ellen was now a strong and vocal anti-abortion advocate, she had an abortion herself in college. This was a true fact that Ellen had told her ex-boyfriend in strictest confidence. This disclosure embarrassed Ellen and made her look like a hypocrite. </p>
          <p>Discuss the possible actions Ellen might bring against the Inkwire and their defenses. </p>

          <p>Ken was a politician from Los Angeles. He moved to Sacramento and purchased a spacious home on the Sacramento River. He felt he got a great deal because he only paid $400,000 and a similar home in Los Angeles would have cost him three times that amount. </p>
          <p>Ken realized his home was directly in the flight path of the airplanes taking off and landing from the County airport, and the realtor had prominently disclosed this fact on the sales documents. But Ken didn't think the noise was so bad because from his backyard he just loved to hear little birds singing along the public river parkway. </p>
          <p>Four years later Ken lost the election and he wanted to move back to Los Angeles. When he had the house appraised, it was worth $500,000. Ken was furious because his home value had only increased 25 percent in value while most real estate had gone up 50 percent. </p>
          <p>Ken blamed the County. In the four years he owned the home the number of flights at the airport increased ten percent. This increased traffic was from increased military use in response to the crisis in Romaria. Ken could not enjoy his yard as much as before, and the little birds on the public river parkway didn't seem to sing as much as they used to. </p>
          <p>What actions might Ken bring against the County, what defenses might be raised, and what remedies are appropriate? </p>

          <p>Star approached Buck, the owner of JavaManiac, with a business proposal. Star knew where there was a retail space for lease that would be a great place for a JavaManiac franchise. Buck told Star that she would be granted a JavaManiac license if the location was acceptable. Based on this Star described the location in detail and gave Buck its address. Buck said he would have someone &quot;check it out.&quot; </p>
          <p>Buck had no intention of giving Star a franchise. He just wanted her to reveal the location. Based on Star's description it sounded perfect for a JavaManiac outlet, and Buck wanted to take the space himself. </p>
          <p>Buck went to the location suggested by Star and saw that it was perfect for JavaManiac. He then contacted the owner, Jack. Jack said he already had tentatively promised the lease to someone named Star. Buck said, &quot;I know Star,&quot; and held his hand in the air with his thumb out to indicate that Star had a drinking problem. Then Buck looked at Jack very sincerely and said, &quot;I probably shouldn't say this, but I feel I have a duty to tell you that you don't want to lease to someone like Star.&quot; </p>
          <p>Buck reported to Star that the location was unacceptable because it was too small to meet the secret JavaManiac minimum guidelines. </p>
          <p>Star was very dejected and withdrew her offer to lease the space. Jack was relieved. </p>
          <p>Three months later Star happened upon the grand opening of the next new JavaManiac franchise at the very location he had suggested. Standing in front were Buck and Jack shaking hands. Star was furious and accused Buck of cheating her. Buck rolled his eyes at Jack and said, &quot;See what I mean?&quot; </p>
          <p>Then Buck sued Star for slander per se for accusing him of questionable business practices. Star won the suit when the jury found her statements had been true. </p>
          <p>What are Star's possible actions against Buck? (Do not discuss intentional infliction, defamation or false light.) </p>
