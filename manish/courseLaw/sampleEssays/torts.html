          <p>Clark Kent, star reporter for the Daily Planet was approached by panhandler Bill Gates and asked for a quarter. As a prank, Kent (who was secretly Superman) lifted and very gently flew Gates hundreds of feet up to the top of the World Tribune building and left Gates there on a ledge. </p>
          <p>Kent hovered over the World Tribune building and never touched the surface of the building. During the flight Gates was apprehensive he might fall, but Kent had a strong grip. </p>
          <p>Gates was embarrassed and the crowd below taunted him for hours as the fire department tried to devise a means of rescue. Gates was humiliated. </p>
          <p>As he stood on the ledge Gates accidentally knocked a decorative panel loose. It fell to the ground and injured fireman Frank. </p>
          <p>Suddenly Gates discovered that there was an unlocked window next to him all the time. He opened the window and escaped immediately. </p>
          <p>Discuss Kent's liability to Gates, the World Tribune and fireman Frank. </p>

          <p>Tom bought some firecrackers in Rural County, where they were legal. He took them into the National Forest where federal law prohibited the possession and use of fireworks. The federal law was enacted to reduce the threat of forest fires and injury on national lands. </p>
          <p>In the National Forest Tom waded to a gravel bar in the middle of Big River, and there he carefully lit and threw the firecrackers into the air above the river. Occasionally one would fail to explode and it would fall harmlessly into the water. There was no one else around, and there was nothing on the gravel bar that could burn. </p>
          <p>Little Dick was playing a half-mile upstream from Tom, throwing sticks into Big River. He was three years old. His mother warned him to stay back from the edge of the river because it was dangerous. Dick disobeyed his mother and recklessly pushed a rotted tree into the river and it swirled away in the water. No one was hurt. </p>
          <p>Half a mile downstream from Tom, Paula was one of five people on the bridge above Big River fishing for trout. Paula was outside the National Forest boundaries. She had ignored a sign that said &quot;No Fishing From Bridge.&quot; Fishing from the bridge was prohibited for traffic safety, but she was well off the roadway and there were very few cars this time of year. Paula was sitting carelessly on the edge of the bridge, but it was a nice day, the water was only six feet below her, and she knew how to swim. </p>
          <p>Tom threw another firecracker into the air and it did not explode. Instead it fell onto the log that Dick had pushed into the river upstream. </p>
          <p>The log swept down the river for half a mile before the firecracker exploded just as the log swept under the bridge. </p>
          <p>Paula was startled and fell into the river. </p>
          <p>Other people that had been fishing rushed off the bridge and down the river bank to rescue Paula as she laughingly climbed up the bank. </p>
          <p>Harry had been fishing too, but instead of going to help Paula, he stayed on the bridge and took two dollars out of Paula's purse. No one saw Harry take the money and the crime was never solved. Paula was hurt and upset. </p>
          <p>Under what theories can Paula seek to recover from Tom and Dick and what defenses would they raise? </p>

          <p>The Macho-X99 chainsaw is a light-duty chainsaw designed for trees no bigger than 18&quot;.

          <p>Dick went into Sam's Bargain Center and said he didn't know much about chainsaws but needed one that could cut a tree about 24&quot; in diameter. Sam told him, &quot;I am an expert when it comes to chainsaws. I recommend this Macho-X99.&quot; Dick bought the Macho-X99 chainsaw. </p>

          <p>Barbara, the famous TV news lady, was assigned to do a story on former governor, Pat Wilson, to find out why Wilson had become almost a recluse in the years since he left office. </p>
          <p>Barbara interviewed Wilson at his home. Wilson's speech was slurred, his eyes were bloodshot and he was unsteady. Barbara asked him about his health, and he declined to comment.

          <p>The National Inkwire focused on sensational articles about celebrities, complete with candid pictures taken during private moments. Actress Ellen D. Generate was pursued relentlessly. </p>
          <p>One time The National Inkwire reported that Ellen was secretly a generous philanthropist. In fact, Ellen was a tightwad. As a result of the Inkwire article, Ellen was besieged by requests for donations, and it was professionally impossible for her to turn them all down. </p>
          <p>Then the Inkwire photographer, Dick took pictures of Ellen sunbathing topless on her sailboat. At the time the photo was taken Ellen was anchored four miles from land in international waters, and she had her friend Anne posted as a lookout to warn of any approaching boats or airplanes. The way Dick got the photo was by using a remote controlled, miniature submarine with a powerful telephoto lens. </p>
          <p>Ellen was so embarrassed by the nude photo that she remained secluded in her home for weeks. </p>
          <p>Ellen decided to sue the Inkwire, so she went to the grocery store and bought a copy of the issue with her photo to show her lawyer. Unfortunately Dick was following her and he took a picture of Ellen buying the Inkwire. Then Inkwire put the picture of Ellen on billboards nationwide with a caption that said &quot;Ellen D. Generate buys Inkwire!&quot; </p>
          <p>Before Ellen could file suit the Inkwire ran an interview with Ellen's old boyfriend from college. He said that even though Ellen was now a strong and vocal anti-abortion advocate, she had an abortion herself in college. This was a true fact that Ellen had told her ex-boyfriend in strictest confidence. This disclosure embarrassed Ellen and made her look like a hypocrite. </p>

    <td valign="top"><p><strong>Sample Essay Solution 5 Invasion of Privacy</strong></p>
      <p>Ellen vs. Inkwire</p>
      <p>1. FALSE LIGHT?</p>
      <p>Under tort law False light is the intentional act of <strong>publishing</strong> a<strong> false portrayal </strong>of the plaintiff in a manner causing <strong>ridicule</strong> or <strong>embarassment</strong>.</p>
      <p>Here Inkwire <strong>published</strong> a portrayal about Ellen because it &quot;reported she was a secret philantrhopist.&quot; This was a <strong>false</strong> portrayal because she was a &quot;tighwad.&quot; And this caused her <strong>embrassment</strong> because she was &quot;besieged with requests&quot; that were &quot;professionally impossible&quot; to reject. Ellen's damages would generally be measured by the amount of embarasment she was caused.</p>
      <p>Therefore, Inkwire may be liable for invasion of privacy under a false light theory.</p>
      <p>2. INTRUSION?</p>
      <p>Under tort law, INTRUSION is an <strong>unreasonable intrusion</strong> into the <strong>peace</strong> and <strong>solitude</strong> of the plaintiff. Damages are measured by the value of lost solitude to the plaintiff.</p>
      <p>Here there was an <strong>unreasonable intrusion</strong> because Dick sent a &quot;submarine&quot; to photograph Ellen through a &quot;telephoto lens&quot;. It disturbed her <strong>peace and solitude </strong>because she had attempted to be alone in a secluded place &quot;miles&quot; from shore with a &quot;posted lookout&quot;. Ellen suffered <strong>damages</strong> because it &quot;embarrassed her&quot; into &quot;seclusion&quot; in her home for &quot;six weeks&quot;.</p>
      <p>Dick would argue that Ellen had <strong>no reasonable expectation</strong> of privacy because she was &quot;in international waters.&quot; Ellen would counter that she had a reasonable expectation of privacy because of the location and precautions she had taken.</p>
      <p>Therefore, Inkwire may be liable for intrusion.</p>
      <p>3. APPROPRIATION OF LIKENESS?</p>
      <p>Under tort law APPROPRIATION is the <strong>unauthorized use</strong> of the <strong>name or likeness of a person</strong> in a manner that<strong> implies endorsement </strong>of a <strong>product or support of a cause</strong>, but not mere publication of names and photos as news articles. Damages are generally measured by the profit to the defendant.</p>
      <p>Here there was a use of Ellen's <strong>photo and name</strong> because billboards with her &quot;picture&quot; said &quot;Ellen D. Generate&quot; buys their paper. And the use was <strong>not authorized </strong>because she did not give permission. The purpose of the billboards was to profit by <strong>implying she endorsed</strong> their paper.</p>
      <p>Ellen's damages would generally be measured by the profits Inkwire made from using her likeness.</p>
      <p>Therefore, Inkwire could be liable for appropriation.</p>
      <p>4. PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF PRIVATE FACTS?</p>
      <p>Under tort law, PUBLIC DISCLOSURE is the <strong>unreasonable public disclosure</strong> of <strong>private facts</strong> that a reasonable person would find <strong>embarrasing</strong>.</p>
      <p>Here there was a <strong>public disclosure</strong> because Inkwire &quot;ran the interview&quot; in its publication. And the facts were <strong>private facts</strong> because they were told to the ex-boyfriend in &quot;strictest confidence.&quot; These were <strong>embarrasing</strong> facts because they concerned an &quot;abortion&quot;, a matter of personal intimacy, and of a nature likely to cause public disdain and ridicule. Ellen would argue Inkwire acted in an <strong>unreasonable</strong> manner.</p>
      <p>Inkwire would argue that it acted <strong>reasonably</strong> because these facts were a matter of legitimate public concern since Ellen had injected herself into public arena as a &quot;strong and vocal anti abortion advocate.&quot; Inkwire would argue the public had a right to know Ellen's true background since she sought to influence public opinion on this controversial topic.</p>
      <p>Therefore, Ellen might fail to show Inkwire acted unreasonably.</p>
      <p>[<strong>ANSWER EXPLANATION:</strong> This question calls for discussion of each of the four Invasion of Privacy torts -- False Light, Appropriation of Likeness, Intrusion and Disclosure of Private Facts (LAID).<br />
        <br />
        The focus in intrusion and disclosure is on the unreasonableness of the acts of the defendant. It is not unreasonable to take a picture of a naked lady if she is lying on a public beach, but it is unreasonable to take the same picture by going to great lengths to avoid detection because it violates &ldquo;reasonable expectations of privacy&rdquo;.<br />
  <br />
        The term &ldquo;money damages&rdquo; generally means an award intended to compensate the plaintiff for losses suffered in terms of property damage, lost income, inconvenience, lost privacy, embarrassment, pain and suffering, etc. But the plaintiff can also request damages measured by the unjust enrichment the defendant would otherwise reap. In that case the plaintiff is said to have, &ldquo;waived the tort and sued in restitution&rdquo;, and the damage award in that case is often referred to as &ldquo;damages in restitution&rdquo;. In most cases of False Light, Intrusion and Disclosure of Private Facts the plaintiff is suing for compensatory damages, and in most cases of Appropriation of Likeness the plaintiff is suing for damages in restitution.<br />
  <br />
    The term &ldquo;damages&rdquo; is broadly misused to mean &ldquo;money judgment&rdquo; and students are strongly advised to get (and read) Nailing the Bar&rsquo;s Simple Remedies Outline early in their law school career.]</p></td>

          <p>Ken was a politician from Los Angeles. He moved to Sacramento and purchased a spacious home on the Sacramento River. He felt he got a great deal because he only paid $400,000 and a similar home in Los Angeles would have cost him three times that amount. </p>
          <p>Ken realized his home was directly in the flight path of the airplanes taking off and landing from the County airport, and the realtor had prominently disclosed this fact on the sales documents. But Ken didn't think the noise was so bad because from his backyard he just loved to hear little birds singing along the public river parkway. </p>
          <p>Four years later Ken lost the election and he wanted to move back to Los Angeles. When he had the house appraised, it was worth $500,000. Ken was furious because his home value had only increased 25 percent in value while most real estate had gone up 50 percent. </p>
          <p>Ken blamed the County. In the four years he owned the home the number of flights at the airport increased ten percent. This increased traffic was from increased military use in response to the crisis in Romaria. Ken could not enjoy his yard as much as before, and the little birds on the public river parkway didn't seem to sing as much as they used to. </p>
          <p>What actions might Ken bring against the County, what defenses might be raised, and what remedies are appropriate? </p>

    </div></td>
    <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td>
    <td valign="top"><p>KEN v COUNTY</p>
      <p>1. Private Nuisance?</p>
      <p>Under tort law Private Nuisance is an unreasonable interference with the plaintiff&rsquo;s use and enjoyment of their land.</p>
      <p>Here there was some interference because the County airport caused &ldquo;noise&rdquo; that prevented ken from &ldquo;enjoying his yard&rdquo; and &ldquo;hearing the birds.&rdquo;. And this involved the use of Ken&rsquo;s land because it was his &ldquo;house&rdquo; and &ldquo;yard.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The two elements that could be most difficult to prove are whether Ken suffered significant damages, and whether the County action was unreasonable. The County would argue that the noise was insufficient interference to prevent Ken from enjoying his land because Ken &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t think the noise was so bad&rdquo; when he bought the house. He in effect CAME TO THE NUISANCE, and that fact suggests the situation was not as bad as Ken claims.</p>
      <p>But Ken would try to prove that the interference was unreasonable because the County let flights increase &ldquo;ten percent&rdquo; in only &ldquo;four years.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The County would also argue that it did not cause the nuisance, and had not acted irresponsibly. The County might argue it was not responsible because the increase in noise was caused by &ldquo;military use&rdquo; beyond their control. Alternatively, the county would argue that it acted reasonably because the flights were in response to the &ldquo;Romaria crises.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Ken would argue that he suffered damages because the value of his home was less that it otherwise would be. But the County would argue there was no proof of financial loss because the home had gone up in value and claim of loss was speculative. Further, the County would argue there was no proof the birds did not sing as much as before.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the County might be liable for private nuisance depending on whether Ken could prove these legal elements.</p>
      <p>2) Public Nuisance?<br />
        Under tort law, Public Nuisance is an unreasonable interference with the plaintiff&rsquo;s use and enjoyment of public resources causing her particular injury that is different or greater than the general public.</p>
      <p>Here the noise interferes with the enjoyment of public land because it prevents Ken from &ldquo;hearing the birds sing&rdquo; on the &ldquo;public river parkway.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The County may argue that Ken lacks standing because he does not suffer any injury that is different form any other member of the public. But ken suffers particular injury because his home is &ldquo;on the river&rdquo; and he could hear the birds sing &ldquo;from his backyard.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Ken would have to prove the other elements of nuisance which are discussed above under private nuisance.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the County may be liable for public nuisance, depending on whether ken can prove the County&rsquo;s action is unreasonable and produces significant damages.</p>
      <p>3) Coming to the Nuisance?</p>
      <p>Under tort law Coming to the Nuisance is the defense that the plaintiff moved to the location where condition complained of already existed. It is a complete bar in a Minority view, but in the Majority view it is only a factor to be considered in determining damages.</p>
      <p>Here Ken moved to the location because he &ldquo;purchased the home.&rdquo; And the condition already existed because he &ldquo;realized his home was in the flight path&rdquo; and the &ldquo;realtor disclosed the fact.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Ken would argue that even though problems existed when he bought the home, they worsened after that. Further, he would argue that in any event the County action is unreasonable per se.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the court would consider Ken&rsquo;s coming to the nuisances only as a factor in determining<br />
        damages in most States.</p>
      <p>4. Remedies?</p>
      <p>The Remedies for a nuisance action include both money damages and injunctive relief. If the nuisance is a temporary situation money damages measured by the loss of use for the period of the nuisance will be an adequate remedy. If the nuisance would continue but for injunctive relief, the Court would consider granting an injunction. Injunctive relief is an equitable remedy, and the court has discretion to deny it. The Court will balance the interests of the parties, the interests of third parties and the feasibility of judicial enforcement. If the Court denies injunctive relief, the appropriate remedy is an award of money damages measured by the loss of property value caused by the nuisance.</p>
    <p>Here the nuisance is a permanent condition, so the Court would consider injunctive relief. But the interest of third parties, people who use the airport, the military, and the County residents would be so significant the Court is unlikely to issue an injunction stopping the airport from continuing operations.</p></td>

Buck told Star that she would be granted a JavaManiac license if the location was acceptable. Based on this Star described the location in detail and gave Buck its address.

<p>Sample Essay Solution 5 Invasion of Privacy</p>
<p>Ellen vs. Inkwire</p>
<p>1. FALSE LIGHT?</p>
<p>Under tort law False light is the intentional act of <strong>publishing</strong> a<strong> false portrayal </strong>of the plaintiff in a manner causing <strong>ridicule</strong> or <strong>embarassment</strong>.</p>
<p>Here Inkwire <strong>published</strong> a portrayal about Ellen because it &quot;reported she was a secret philantrhopist.&quot; This was a <strong>false</strong> portrayal because she was a &quot;tighwad.&quot; And this caused her <strong>embrassment</strong> because she was &quot;besieged with requests&quot; that were &quot;professionally impossible&quot; to reject. Ellen's damages would generally be measured by the amount of embarasment she was caused.</p>
<p>Therefore, Inkwire may be liable for invasion of privacy under a false light theory.</p>
<p>2. INTRUSION?</p>
<p>Under tort law, INTRUSION is an <strong>unreasonable intrusion</strong> into the <strong>peace</strong> and <strong>solitude</strong> of the plaintiff. Damages are measured by the value of lost solitude to the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Here there was an <strong>unreasonable intrusion</strong> because Dick sent a &quot;submarine&quot; to photograph Ellen through a &quot;telephoto lens&quot;. It disturbed her <strong>peace and solitude </strong>because she had attempted to be alone in a secluded place &quot;miles&quot; from shore with a &quot;posted lookout&quot;. Ellen suffered <strong>damages</strong> because it &quot;embarrassed her&quot; into &quot;seclusion&quot; in her home for &quot;six weeks&quot;.</p>
<p>Dick would argue that Ellen had <strong>no reasonable expectation</strong> of privacy because she was &quot;in international waters.&quot; Ellen would counter that she had a reasonable expectation of privacy because of the location and precaustions she had taken.</p>
<p>Therefore, Inkwire may be liable for intrusion.</p>
<p>3. APPROPRIATION OF LIKENESS?</p>
<p>Under tort law APPROPRIATION is the <strong>unauthorized use</strong> of the <strong>name or likeness of a person</strong> in a manner that<strong> implies endorsement </strong>of a <strong>product or support of a cause</strong>, but not mere publication of names and photos as news articles. Damages are generally measured by the profit to the defendant.</p>
<p>Here there was a use of Ellen's <strong>photo and name</strong> because billboards with her &quot;picture&quot; said &quot;Ellen D. Generate&quot; buys their paper. And the use was <strong>not authorized </strong>because she did not give permission. The purpose of the billboards was to profit by <strong>implying she endorsed</strong> their paper.</p>
<p>Ellen's damages would generally be measured by the profits Inkwire made from using her likeness.</p>
<p>Therefore, Inkwire could be liable for appropriation.</p>
<p>4. PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF PRIVATE FACTS?</p>
<p>Under tort law, PUBLIC DISCLOSURE is the <strong>unreasonable public disclosure</strong> of <strong>private facts</strong> that a reasonable person would find <strong>embarrasing</strong>.</p>
<p>Here there was a <strong>public disclosure</strong> because Inkwire &quot;ran the interview&quot; in its publication. And the facts were <strong>private facts</strong> because they were told to the ex-boyfriend in &quot;strictest confidence.&quot; These were <strong>embarrasing</strong> facts because they concerned an &quot;abortion&quot;, a matter of personal intimacy, and of a nature likely to cause public disdain and ridicule. Ellen would argue Inkwire acted in an <strong>unreasonable</strong> manner.</p>
<p>Inkwire would argue that it acted <strong>reasonably</strong> because these facts were a matter of legitimate public concern since Ellen had injected herself into public arena as a &quot;strong and vocal anti abortion advocate.&quot; Inkwire would argue the public had a right to know Ellen's true background since she sought to influence public opinion on this controversial topic.</p>
<p>Therefore, Ellen might fail to show Inkwire acted unreasonably.</p>
<p>[<strong>ANSWER EXPLANATION:</strong> This question calls for discussion of each of the four Invasion of Privacy torts -- False Light, Appropriation of Likeness, Intrusion and Disclosure of Private Facts (LAID).<br /><br />
The focus in intrusion and disclosure is on the unreasonableness of the acts of the defendant. It is not unreasonable to take a picture of a naked lady if she is lying on a public beach, but it is unreasonable to take the same picture by going to great lengths to avoid detection because it violates “reasonable expectations of privacy”.<br /><br />
The term “money damages” generally means an award intended to compensate the plaintiff for losses suffered in terms of property damage, lost income, inconvenience, lost privacy, embarrassment, pain and suffering, etc. But the plaintiff can also request damages measured by the unjust enrichment the defendant would otherwise reap. In that case the plaintiff is said to have, “waived the tort and sued in restitution”, and the damage award in that case is often referred to as “damages in restitution”. In most cases of False Light, Intrusion and Disclosure of Private Facts the plaintiff is suing for compensatory damages, and in most cases of Appropriation of Likeness the plaintiff is suing for damages in restitution.<br /><br />
The term “damages” is broadly misused to mean “money judgment” and students are strongly advised to get (and read) Nailing the Bar’s Simple Remedies Outline early in their law school career.]</p>
