Although the refinery is a â€œstate of the artâ€ operation, it occasionally releases noxious, but harmless, gas into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nA man recently leased land adjoining the oil companyâ€™s refinery and occupies a home on the property. The man started complaining that the gas released by the refinery sometimes makes him nauseous and that, as a result, he cannot mow his lawn or have picnics on the lawn. If the man sues the oil company over the gas, his best theory of recovery will be for:', '["Strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities.","Private nuisance.","Public nuisance.","Negligence."]', 2, 'B is the correct answer. Private nuisance is the interference with the use and enjoyment of one''s property. Here, the gas that is being omitted by the oil company interferes with the manâ€™s use and enjoyment of his property, since he cannot mow his lawn or have picnics on the lawn, due to the effects of the gas. Thus, the manâ€™s best theory of recovery is private nuisance. AnswerA is incorrect because there is nothing in the facts to suggest that the refineryâ€™s activities are abnormally dangerous; the fact that one man may become nauseous as a result of the gas does not indicate that this happens to everyone. Answer C is incorrect. In order to sue for public nuisance, one must demonstrate that other members of the public are affected by the gas, and the person bringing the suit must suffer specialized harm (i.e., harm that is different from that suffered by other members of the public). Here, there is no indication that other members of the public are affected by the gas. Thus, public nuisance is not the best theory of recovery under these facts. Answer D is incorrect, as well. Negligence is a breach of a duty, causing harm. Here, there is no indication that the oil company breached any duties in its operation of the refinery, especially in light of the fact that the refinery was state-of-the-art, showing that, if anything, the oil company was not careless.', '2016-07-08 02:53:01', 0),

Here, the tenant was in lawful possession of the apartment and, thus, he had standing to bring a suit to abate the private nuisance (the loud music). Answer A is incorrect because, as discussed in Answer D, a lessee does have standing to sue for private nuisance; one need not be an owner to sue for private nuisance. Answer B is incorrect, since a private citizen can bring suit to abate a public nuisance when he has an injury different in kind from the general public. However, there is no indication that the music is bothering anybody else (the public). Thus, public nuisance would not be an appropriate theory under which to bring the lawsuit. Answer C is incorrect because mere residency in the area does not confer standing; as discussed in Answer D, one must be in lawful possession of land in the area, as well.', '2016-07-08 04:45:38', 0),

An equity court, when considering whether to abate a private nuisance, will balance the hardships. Here, it will likely find that the value of the cell phone towers as Operated outweighs occasional inconvenience to the woman. The woman, of course, can still recover damages, but her suit here is for an injunction. The cell phone companyâ€™s best defense to the suit is the social necessity of the cell phone towers, since the cell phone company appears to operate the towers in a proper place in a proper manner.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect because coming to the nuisance is not a complete defense, but rather, one factor the court will consider on the abatement issue. Answer C is incorrect because it is not relevant to the womanâ€™s individual claim for private nuisance. Answer D is an incorrect statement of law.', '2016-07-08 04:58:21', 0);
