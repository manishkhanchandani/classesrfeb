Teste mentions that it has the reputation of being much more poisonous to carnivorous animals than to the herbivora. This he partly endorses, and it has recently been apparently confirmed by a vain attempt to poison an elephant with </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Aconitine</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> in this country. A carrot was scraped out and enough </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Aconitine</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> to poison 2,000 men was put in. The elephant ate it readily, but nothing at all happened, and three hours later a large dose of prussic-acid had to be administered, which proved fatal in a short time.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Before Hahnemann's time </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Aconite</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> had a reputation as a sudorific, and in cases of rheumatism, sciatica, and tumours, but it was not till Hahnemann proved it that its properties were really, understood. Aconite is more closely associated with the rise and progress of homeopathy than any other member of the materia medica. If </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Cinchona</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> was the "Newton's apple" of the homeopathic discovery, </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Aconite</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> was the remedy by means of which Hahnemann was able to meet most of the conditions which in his day were treated by blood-letting. It was </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Aconite</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> more than any other remedy which paved the way for the disappearance of blood-letting from general medical practice. One of the deadliest and most rapidly acting of poisons, through Hahnemann's discoveries has been turned into the best friend of the nursery. </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Aconite</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> in potencies above the 3rd is a perfectly safe medicine for any age. Sensitive patients complain of its depressing action when repeated, and I have known instances in which the characteristic prostration of mind and body has occurred after </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Aconite</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> had been given in the potencies. But such cases are exceptions, and are not attended with danger when they do occur. The great majority of patients to whom </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Aconite</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> is given in the potencies experience nothing of the kind.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The rapidity of action of </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Aconite</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> determines its appropriateness for conditions in which the symptoms set in with great intensity, such as Asiatic cholera, certain fevers, and acute inflammations. To this list may be added attacks of sudden blindness. But it must not be supposed that the sphere of </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Aconite</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> is limited to acute cases. When the symptoms correspond it will cure cases of great chronicity</span><span class="cs8F386883">─</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">for example, cases of indurated glands.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Dr. Hughes has acutely remarked that the condition to which </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Aconite</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> is homeopathic is one of </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">tension</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">; and this word gives the best idea of the action and sphere of </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Aconite</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. There is emotional and mental tension, as shown in fright or fear and its consequences, anxiety, and fear of death; tension of the systemic vessels, as in the effects of a chill, Asiatic cholera, and haemorrhages; muscular tension, as in tetanus; tension of involuntary muscles, as in heart spasms, and tension of the semi-involuntary muscular apparatus of respiration, as in asthma; and finally tension of the special senses in heightened sensation and heightened sensitiveness to pain; in a feeling of numbness in parts, as if bound tightly, and also a sensation of being tightly bound in the limbs and in other parts. Hence it is that </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Aconite</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> in its therapeutic action corresponds to the effects of a number of conditions which excite a state of tension. Plethora may be classed under this head. Plethoric persons of a lively character, bilious and nervous constitutions, high colour, brown or black hair, are specially suited to </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. Active, sanguineous congestions of all kinds, especially those following chill. Guernsey puts it in another way: "The pure and fully developed blood globule, in its most perfect type, when diseased, has a great affinity for </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. When the blood globules are disorganised it is seldom indicated. We think of </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. in sudden inflammation, especially if caused by cold, </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">dry air</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">, suppressing exhalations of the body." Teste relates a remarkable case of an Englishman who had been obliged to take a long sleigh journey in North Russia in midwinter, who suffered thereafter for two years from violent paroxysms of palpitation and acute stitching pains in the heart region, threatening cerebral apoplexy. Aneurism had been diagnosed by leading physicians in England and on the Continent. Teste localised the affection to neurosis or spasm of the pectoralis major muscle, and proved his diagnosis by promptly curing it with </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. The keen, cutting winds of the mountains amongst which the plant flourishes give the signature of this remedial action.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There are not many drugs which have causation so strongly marked among their characteristics. Chill, fright, injury, or surgical operation</span><span class="cs8F386883">─</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">the effects of these will be met in large majority of cases by </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">., the timely administration of which will ward off serious results.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The reaction from the primary effect of chill gives another characteristic of </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">.</span><span class="cs8F386883">─</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">that of fever. With the </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. fever there are: Restlessness and tossing about, and the tension state is evidenced still in the anxiety with which it is accompanied, sometimes amounting to fear of death. The mental exaltation sometimes goes so far as to the predicting of the day and hour of death. Clairvoyance. Extreme sensitiveness to light and sound and all sensations including pain. When the sickness is borne with calmness and patience </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. is not likely to be required. It was the feverish restlessness of the </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. provings that led Hahnemann to infer its homeopathicity to so many fever states; and it is the presence of this restlessness, anxiety, fear, and exalted sensibility which are its leading indications in cases of all kinds.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Some characteristics of </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. are the following: Active haemorrhages in stout, plethoric people. Passes almost pure blood by stool. In haemoptysis the blood comes up with great ease by hemming and coughing, bright red in large quantities, from cold, dry winds, with great fear, anxiety, and palpitation. Every inspiration increases the cough. After the cough tingling sensation in chest. Unquenchable thirst: everything tastes bitter, except water (</span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Chi</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. everything, </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">including</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> water). In croup the child grasps the throat with every coughing fit. Coldness, numbness, and tingling characterise the paralyses and neuroses of </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. Facial paralysis from exposure to cold, dry winds. The fear and apprehension of </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. is shown in dread of crossing streets. There is intolerance of music. Some curious symptoms are: Imagines some part of body is deformed. Imagine they do all their thinking from the stomach. Predicts the hour of death (clairvoyance).</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. is one of the great </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">pain</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> remedies, vying with </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Cham</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. and </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Coffea</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> in the intensity of the pain it causes. Pains are intolerable, driving to desperation. The pains of </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. are tearing, cutting; are attended with restlessness; accompanied by numbness, tingling, or formication. </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. cannot bear the pain, cannot bear to be touched, cannot bear to be covered. The toothache of </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. is one-sided, with red cheek on same side.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Guernsey gives the following excellent directions: "If a child is suffering from a watery diarrhoea, is crying and complaining very much, biting his fists and is sleepless, </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. will usually settle this trouble in a short time. The disturbed condition of the mind will cease and quiet sleep will follow. The mother will now remark: "Doctor, he is all right, except his bowels, and they are as bad as ever." Now, do not give another remedy, but wait and see if </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. will not complete the cure by itself." Again: Scanty, red, and hot urine, arising from taking cold, especially in children. The child screams and appears to be in great pain because it cannot urinate. </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. will ease the pain, quiet the child, and the urine will flow some time after. In adults, incontinence of urine will sometimes be relieved by </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There is a great and sudden sinking of strength; fainting on attempting to get up; with anxiety, restlessness, numbness, tingling, formication.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. has a very wide sphere of usefulness in affections of the eye. Inflammation, of many kinds, from cold, injury, dust, surgical operations, scrofulous inflammation with enlarged glands, all come within its range. Some remarkable cases of sudden blindness have been cured by it. Hirsch of Prague records two such cases, one in a man of thirty, who went to bed well, having walked home in rough and stormy weather after spending the evening in a hot room. </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. 3 was given, and the following night he perspired freely, and in the morning his sight was thoroughly restored. Hirsch himself suddenly lost his sight whilst bathing in hot weather. He took </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. 3 in water as he had given it to his patient. In two hours he began to perspire, and after a six-hours' sleep awoke well. Lippe has recorded the case of a lady whom he found much distressed, anxious, fearing paralysis. In her usual, health she had taken a full dinner, and when reading afterwards, the letters danced before her eyes, and the print became blurred; then face and nose became numb; pulse small, 120 a minute. One dose </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. c.m. (Fincke) was given. The numbness disappeared in half an hour; Pulse 72; the sight was perfect when she closed either eye, but everything looked indistinct when she kept both open. This symptom disappeared next morning; a slight lightness of the head remaining that day.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The time of the aggravation of </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. symptoms is chiefly night and about midnight. </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Heat</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">, as well as </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">cold</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">, is injurious to the </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. patient; sunstroke is among the conditions which call for it; and </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Acon</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. will cure many headaches caused by exposure to the sun, and also sun-erythema. Headaches are generally </span><span class="csB86C8CFE">&gt;</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> in open air, </span><span class="csB86C8CFE">&lt;</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> in warm room; toothache and cough </span><span class="csB86C8CFE">&lt;</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> in open air. </span><span class="csB86C8CFE">&gt;</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> From uncovering.
