FEAR OF CANCER WITH JERKING AND TWITCHING

The psychological pathology of Agaricus typically manifests in dependent, weak-willed individuals. These persons have from an early age established a pattern of seeking the guidance and domination of a stronger person. They have a sweet, non-aggressive manner and instead of showing their anger the muscles of their face twitch. Agaricus patients are frequently troubled by an extreme anxiety about their health. The anxiety about health is centered on a tremendous fear of cancer.
