On the other hand there is prostration and somnolence. "Fool's parsley" has not received its name for nothing</span><span class="csA62DFD6A">â”€</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">it is indeed a medicine for "fools." There is great weakness of mind or body. One very characteristic symptom is: </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Inability to think or fix the attention</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. Guided by this symptom I once gave it to an undergraduate preparing for an examination, with complete success. He had been compelled to give up his studies, but was able to resume them, and passed a brilliant examination. To a little waif in an orphan home who suffered from severe headaches and inability to fix his attention on his lessons I sent single doses of </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Aeth</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. at rare intervals, with very great relief. The little boy asked for the medicine himself subsequently on a return of the old symptoms. Other mental symptoms are: Idiocy; in some cases alternating with furor. Hallucinations. Delirium; sees cats and dogs; wants to jump out of bed, or out of the window. Irritability, especially in open air. Guernsey says: "The mental symptoms peculiar to children, and frequently of adults, are, great anguish and crying. As the disease progresses the patient becomes more and more retired in his disposition, and more inclined to weep." Somnolence. Dotage. Another marked characteristic is: Intolerance of milk; vomiting of everything taken, especially milk, which is ejected in yellowish or greenish curds. There is great weakness and exhaustion after vomiting; the child is so exhausted it </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">falls asleep at once</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">. It awakens hungry, eats, and vomits again. "Hungry after vomiting" is the keynote here. There is also griping, with diarrhoeÂœa, vomiting, crying. For adults who complain of regurgitation of food an hour after it has been taken </span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Aeth</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">., says Guernsey, is invaluable. Also copious vomiting in adults, with a great feeling of distress; can't tell what the distress is about but still it exists. Adults complain of a sensation as though the stomach was turned upside down, accompanied by a burning feeling up to the chest. Tearing pains in stomach extending into oeÂœsophagus; abdomen tense, inflated, sensitive. There is an herpetic eruption on tip of nose. Along with the gastric symptoms there is a peculiar expression of great anxiety and pain (</span><span class="csA62DFD6A">Linea nasalis</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">), a surface of pearly whiteness on upper lip bounded by distinct lines from wings of nose to angles of mouth. Other symptoms are: Sensation of swelling in head and face on entering a room. Sunken cornea. Eyeballs convulsed and directed downwards. Sleep after attacks. Sensation of swelling in hands after walking. Convulsions, with cold limbs. The pains are lancinating. Swelling of mammary or axillary glands, with lancinating pains. Prostration; stupid. All symptoms &lt; 3 to 4 a.m. Heat = all eruptions to itch intolerably.

CYNAPIUM</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Aeth.)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Before Aethusa was
known a certain class of cases of cholera infantum, and vomiting
and diarrohea in children, all resulted fatally, because there was
no remedy that looked like such serious cases. Death is stamped on
the face from the beginning, and if there are any remedies in the
book that save life this is one of them. It applies to the cases
that come on very suddenly in hot weather in infancy, with extreme
prostration. The mother does not suspect the child is sick until
she takes it from the crib; only a few hours before it was well;
but when cholera infantum is prevalent in hot weather, this little
one fills its stomach with milk and almost before it has had time
to coagulate or form into curds the milk comes up partly in curds
and partly liquid, and accompanying the vomiting there is a thin,
yellow greenish, slimy stool. The child has the appearance as if it
were dying, pale hippocratic face, there is a whitish-blue pallor
around the lips, the eyes are sunken and there is a sunken
condition around the nose. The mother is astonished and sends for
the doctor hurriedly. The child sinks into an exhausted sleep. It
wakes up and again, fills the stomach with milk which comes up
again in a few minutes, partly in curd and partly liquid, and again
there is the awful exhaustion, deathly appearance and prolonged
sleep. Without Aethusa, in two or three days the undertaker gets
that child. That is pretty nearly the whole story of
Aethusa.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">STOMACH-ABDOMEN-RECTUM-STOOL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It has delirium, it
has excitement, it has mental disturbances of various kinds, but
they are acute and accompany the brain troubles. A certain class of
infants comes down sick in the hot weather, in the hot nights, and
they get brain trouble, and from that time the stomach quits
business, the bowels become relaxed, and everything put into the
stomach either comes up or goes right through. This occurs
especially in those infants that have been fed as the ordinary
everyday mother feeds her baby, and how is that? Every time it
cries she puts it to the breast or feeds it. Well, now, let us
think a bit. Every doctor ought to think a little, once in a while.
Now meditate a trifle as to whether that is a wise or foolish thing
to do. It takes about two hours or two hours and a half for the
ordinary baby's stomach to transact good wholesome business in
digesting the milk taken, and it ought to have a rest of half an
hour or so, and when we get up to three hours and the baby cries
then it is probably hungry and will be glad to take some more and
digest it. Any shorter interval of feeding than that is bad
practice. It would be just the same thing if the child should take
half a teacupful of milk and let it partly digest, and in a little
while take a little more, and then later add a little more. It
commences to spit up its food and it is sour, and the very first
spell of hot weather that comes brings on head trouble. Only the
toughest children will stand this bad method. I have watched these
children and seen them stand it until the summer. The doctor must
put his foot down, and put it down violently, and make them see he
means it. The old woman comes in and says: "That doctor does not
know anything" and the baby must be fed. Now Aethusa suits
improperly fed babies. It is at the head of the list of medicines
for that condition; that is, when digestion has absolutely ceased
from brain trouble. So far as busy doctors have discovered the call
for this remedy, it has been mostly among babies, but adults
sometimes take on an Aethusa state, when digestion has absolutely
ceased from brain trouble and from excitement. It has cured
dyspepsia from constant feeding, in those nibblers, those hungry
fellows who are always eating, always nibbling, always taking
crackers in their pockets until there comes a time when the stomach
ceases to act. It also suits cases of indigestion from head
troubles, with hot head, vomiting, exhaustion, sweat and long
sleep.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Aethusa has
convulsions in children. Sometimes the brain trouble does not
affect the stomach, but the child goes into convulsions, with
clammy hands, deathly countenance, and the sweat, exhaustion and
sleep. "Convulsions, great weakness and prostration with
sleepiness. Dosing of the child after vomiting and after stool,
with convulsions."</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the Aethusa
patient there is much in the face and aspect to indicate a remedy;
so much can be seen and comes within the observation, and so little
questioning is necessary, that a sort of snap-shot prescribing can
be done, but it is not to be recommended. A busy physician, one who
really and truly studies his Materia Medica, and has learned the
principles, will in time do a great deal of what seems to be
snap-shot prescribing, but he really does not do so, because he
puts together many things that outsiders would not think of Aethusa
then shows itself upon the surface, whereas in many remedies there
is nothing seen upon the surface, because they manifest themselves
in inner or deeper sensations. Let me lay a case before you to
illustrate this. For instance, take a robust looking fellow, who
declares himself fairly well, out to lunch, with you. You have
noticed for some time that his nose is all the time peeling off; at
once there is a star. He never talks about his health, pretty soon,
while lunching, the door slams and he jumps. That is the second
point. Then he tells you how much he eats, how well it affects him,
how good he feels after eating, and you have noticed yourself that
he eats a good deal. You have not said one word about his health to
him. You have not asked him to tell you any symptoms. Finally you
shove the pitcher of milk over to him, and he says, "Oh, I can't
drink milk; if I take milk it gives me diarrohea; I never think of
taking it." Who could not prescribe for that fellow without taking
him into the office? Who would think of anything but NAT- C., for
such a case? Sometimes you can find out the whole story by getting
a stubborn patient to go and dine with you.</span></p>
