<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">ALLIUM
CEPA</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(All-c.)</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Allium cepa is used
principally for "colds." There are various phases of these "colds,"
in the nose, in the throat, in the larynx, in the bronchial tubes.
The patient and all the phases of his "cold," his coryza, his
laryngitis, his cough, all his complaints, are aggravated by
warmth, are worse in a warm room, excepting the tickling in the
larynx, which is sometimes aggravated by drawing in cold air. In
this way the cough is sometimes excited by cold air, but the
patient himself is better in cold air and sensitive to heat. Most
of the symptoms are worse in the evening, the symptoms of coryza,
the "cold," and the general symptoms. These are the two most
striking general features of Allium cepa.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">THROAT</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It is not strange
that the old ladies used to bind onions on the ear for earache and
around the neck for sore throats, for onion is very frequently
indicated in almost every climate for the effects of cold. Cold,
damp, penetrating winds, in any climate, are likely to bring on
Allium cepa complaints-coryza, la grippe, influenza or whatever
they may be called, and usually there is a congestive headache.
Rawness in the nose, copious flow of water from the eyes, which is
always bland; copious watery discharge from the nose, which is
always excoriating. Rawness in the larynx and throat, extending
down into the chest. Rawness in the nose. In twenty-four hours it
reaches the larynx. Cough, excited by tickling in the larynx and
when lying down at night in a warm room. On going to bed in the
evening Allium has its most troublesome aggravation. I have heard
patients describe the pain in the larynx on coughing, saying that
it felt as if someone was reaching down with a hook at every cough.
Tearing in the larynx with every cough. Sneezing, rawness of all
the mucous membranes and that tearing cough all symptoms worse in a
warm room and in the evening; it is astonishing how quickly the
onion will break up that "cold."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE-EYE-HEAD</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Now we will take up
the particulars of the coryza. Among the earlier symptoms will be
the sneezing, which comes with increasing frequency. A watery
discharge drips from the nose constantly, burns like fire, and
excoriates the upper lip and the wings of the nose until there are
rawness and redness. Notice that the fluid from the nose is
excoriating and the fluid from the eyes bland. Bear that in mind,
for when we come to study EUPHRASIA we will find just the opposite.
We will find just such a watery discharge from the nose and such
copious lachrymation, but the lachrymation is acrid and the
discharge from the nose bland. The nasal discharge of Cepa fairly
eats the hair off of the upper lip. And there is so much congestion
that the patient has a sensation of fullness in the nose, with
throbbing and burning, and sometimes nosebleed. Pains through the
jaws, in the face; and these pains extend into the head. Dull
frontal headaches, occipital headaches; headaches very severe and
the eyes cannot stand the light; tearing, bursting, throbbing in
the head.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Now, there is
another phase of this medicine. Why it begins on the left side and
goes over to the right I do not know, but it usually does this.
Stuffing up of the side of the nose, watery, acrid discharge from
the left side of the nose -in another twenty-four hours the right
side is invaded. "Profuse nasal discharge. Colds after damp
north-easterly winds." That is, after damp, cold winds, for they
may come from different directions in different localities. Fluent
coryza with headache, tears from the eyes, want of appetite, cough
and trembling in the open air. "Every year in August, morning
coryza, with violent sneezing, very sensitive to the odor of
flowers and skin of peaches." That is one form of hay fever cured
by Allium cepa. It will wipe out an attack of hay fever in a few
days, when the symptoms agree. You may know that the true nature of
hay fever is not generally understood. It is really only an
explosion of chronic disease, that is, it is a manifestation of
psora, and can be eradicated only by antipsoric treatment. Many a
time have I seen hay fever wiped out in one season by a
short-acting remedy, only to return the next just the same, and
perhaps another remedy will be required. As soon as the hay fever
is stopped you must begin with constitutional treatment. There will
be symptoms, if you know how to hunt for them that differ
altogether from the acute attack. When the hay fever is on these do
not appear. It is a difficult matter to find a constitutional
remedy when the hay fever is at its height, for it resembles an
acute disease; but it is a manifestation of psora, like any other
manifestation of psora, as eruptions, cough, etc. The nose may
manifest only a certain phase of chronic disease in one season
which may, for instance, be suited to Allium cepa. I remember one
time having occasion to prescribe Allium cepa at long distance. It
was near a homeopathic pharmacy. I wired the pharmacist to send my
patient Allium cepa, and he labeled it. Well, the patient kept the
bottle and used it next season, but it did no good. That is likely
to be the case, even when the symptoms seem to agree. In a psoric
condition a short-acting remedy is insufficient, it may help for
one day only, and the deep-acting remedy that includes the patient
as well as the hay fever and all the other symptoms will have to be
administered. The best time to treat hay fever is after the acute
attack subsides and until it begins again the next season. It will
then occur in a greatly modified form, different from any the
patient has ever had, and calling for a different remedy. That will
be the case if the constitutional remedy has been properly
selected.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EAR</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In these coryzas the
inflammation soon spreads to the ears, the throat and the larynx.
The old mothers used to put onions on the baby's ear when it had
earache. That is not surprising, when we see all the pains and
aches belonging to this remedy. Jerking pains from the throat
toward the Eustachian tube. Violent earache, even to the discharge
of pus from the ear. Ringing in the ears. Stitches towards the ear
from the forehead. Pain like thick threads drawing from deep within
the head. Stitching, tearing pains in the ear, with whooping cough,
with coryza, with laryngitis. In the household where a medicine
case is kept PULSATILLA is the standard remedy for earache, and it
is true that only occasionally has a doctor to be sent for.
PULSATILLA has such a strong affinity for the ear that it will cure
earache in almost all sensitive children who cry pitifully. But
those who are snappish, who are never suited, and who will throw
away something they have asked for and slap the nurse in the face
must have CHAMOMILLA.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">With PULSATILLA,
CHAMOMILLA and Allium cepa you can cure the majority of earaches in
children.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Further, as to the
eye symptoms that accompany the Allium cepa colds. Remember that
the discharge from the eye is bland. Although there is burning in
the eyes the tears do not excoriate as they flow down over the
cheek. Profuse, bland lachrymation. Lachrymation in the evening in
a warm room.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">ABDOMEN</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">We all know what a
flatulent vegetable the onion is. It is a wonderful medicine for
babies with colic. Cutting, rending, tearing pains drawing the poor
little thing almost double. It screams with the violent cutting in
the lower abdomen. "Stitching pains in the abdomen." "Colic pains
beginning in the hepatic region and spreading over the whole
abdomen, worse around the navel; worse when sitting." Wind colic.
Allium cepa is a wonderful remedy in whooping cough, and when it is
indicated, the child will often have indigestion, vomiting and
flatulency; will pass offensive flatus, will be doubled up with
colic. Allium cepa also cures a ragged, sensitive condition of the
anus, with bleeding, in infants.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">LARYNX AND
TRACHEA-COUGH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Acute complaints of
the voice; catarrhal hoarseness; copious expectoration of mucus
from the larynx. Violent inflammation of the larynx coming on very
rapidly, with that cough I spoke of, and the tearing in the larynx.
Some will describe it as a sensation as if something were being
torn loose. Those who describe more accurately will say that it
feels as if a hook were dragging up through the larynx with every
cough. Tickling in the larynx with hoarseness. In the whooping
cough there is this same painfulness of the larynx. The child
shakes and shudders and you can see that it dreads the cough
because of the tearing pain in the larynx. Cough and difficult
breathing from inspiring cold air, yet a warm draft will so
increase the tickling that it is sure to set the patient coughing.
So the cough is aggravated both by cold air and a warm room. Colds
sometimes travel down into the bronchial tubes and are attended
with fever and rapid pulse. If the tickling in the larynx, the
cough from inspiring the cold air, worse in a warm room and in the
evening, with tearing pain in the larynx, are present, Allium cepa
will cure. The cough is spasmodic and resembles croup or whooping
cough. Cepa has a record for croupy cough. The old lady binds onion
on the throat of the child with croup, and no doubt, out in the
back woods, where there are no doctors, it was far better than Old
School treatment.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Here is a fairly
good description from the Guiding Symptoms: "Hoarse, harsh,
ringing, spasmodic cough, excited by constant tickling in the
larynx; cough produces a raw, splitting pain in the larynx, so
acute and so severe as to compel the patient to crouch from
suffering, and to make every effort to suppress the cough."
"Severe, laryngeal cough, which compels the patient to grasp the
larynx; feels as if cough would tear it." The child will reach up
to the larynx and clutch it. This is wholly different from the
ACONITUM condition, when the child, after exposure to a dry, cold
wind, wakes before midnight with a hoarse, barking cough, and
clutches the larynx. So ACONITUM cannot be substituted for Allium
cepa.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Another affection
over which this remedy has marvellous power is traumatic neuritis,
often met with in a stump after amputation. The pains are almost
unbearable, rapidly exhausting the strength of the
