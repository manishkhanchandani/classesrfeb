<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">ALOE
SOCOTRINA</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Aloe)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Aloe, much like
AESCULUS, has a peculiar engorgement of the veins, causing
stiffness and fullness throughout the body, but the greatest
disturbance is in the veins of the portal system, with great
fullness in the region of the liver, and abdominal, rectal and
intestinal fullness. This is associated with haemorrhoids. It has
abdominal pains that drive him to stool like NUX VOMICA, cutting,
cramping pains around the navel. Pains about the navel that shoot
down towards the rectum, cutting like knives. Dysenteric and
diarrhoeic troubles. In the attacks of diarrhoea there is gushing
of thin, yellow, offensive, excoriating faeces, which burn like
fire and the anus is sore. He holds the stool with difficulty, does
not dare take his mind off the sphincter because as soon as he does
so the stool will escape. He cannot let the least quantity of
flatus escape, because with it there will be a rush of faeces. With
the Aloe diarrhoea, the abdomen is distended with gas, causing a
feeling of fullness and tightness, and he must go often to stool.
Little ones, soon after they begin to walk, will drop all over the
carpet, involuntarily, little yellow drops of mucus and faeces. The
mother sometimes punishes the little ones, but they cannot help it,
they cannot hold the stool, as it is passed involuntarily. There is
a lack of control of the sphincter. This state is not always
confined to diarrhoea, because sometimes children will go around
dropping, involuntarily, little, hard, round marble-like pieces of
stool. They do not even know the stool has passed. There is
relaxation about the rectum and protrusion of the anus, with
bleeding piles. Every mouthful of food hurries him to stool;
drinking water will often hurry him to stool. Diarrhoea from eating
oysters out of season. You might be disposed to give LYCOPODIUM,
because in the text books poisoning from oysters is laid down under
LYC. I do not know that you would be justified in saying poisoning
from oysters in season is LYC., and out of season is Aloe, but
there is a tremendous poisoning effect about oysters in the hot
weather and in the breeding season that is not found at any other
time. A great many people become nauseated, bloat up, purge
tremendously, vomit everything for several days after eating
oysters. Now, when that group of symptoms is present LYCOPODIUM
will cure it and will remove the tendency to get sick from oysters.
But if you notice those who get sick have a cholera-like trouble
from eating oysters in the hot season, you will find that that is
where Aloe is the remedy.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This remedy is not
well proved hence I have first referred to the things it is used
for clinically. It is more nearly related to SULPHUR in its venous
condition than to any other remedy. If you study together, side by
side, KALI-BI., SULPHUR and Aloe, you will be astonished at their
wonderful relation to the stomach and bowels.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Among the few mental
symptoms we notice, "She knew she would die in a week." "Life is a
burden." "Disinclined to move." Very little is brought out by which
we can distinguish it; only a few things common to many remedies
are given. The Aloe patient is extremely excitable when under the
influence of pain, and the pains are generally in the abdomen.
Colic-like pains, flatulent pains in the abdomen, that drive to
despair; he becomes extremely irritable and excited in his attacks
of colic. A little symptom that is somewhat striking is, "Hates
people, repels everyone."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The head congestion,
which occurs during the bowel disturbance, is a sort of venous
stasis such as is found in the portal system. "Headache across
forehead." "Headaches aggravated from heat, ameliorated from cold
applications." Aggravation from heat and relief from cold runs
through Aloe. He wants to be in a cool room; feels hot and flushed;
the skin is often hot and dry; he wants to be uncovered at night in
bed; burning of the extremities, hot hands and cold feet, or cold
hands and hot feet; these alternate. The head feels hot and he
wants something cool upon it. This is from the heat of the surface,
not fever.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Sensation of heat in
the surface, feeling of congestion and fullness of the surface of
the body; fullness and engorged veins all over the body. Bleedings
are common in this remedy, venous oozing from the nose, the bowels,
the bladder; bleeding in general. The veins become varicose and the
skin is hot. Much heat in the orifices of the body; the eyes, mouth
and throat are hot and burn. There is a sensation of dryness,
burning and excoriation about the anus.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">ABDOMEN-RECTUM-STOOL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Under "Eating and
Drinking" we find "Soon after supper growling in abdomen." There
are colic pains in the bowels from eating and drinking when there
is no diarrhoea, even when there is a state of
constipation.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This remedy is
useful for the complaints of old beer drinkers. Diarrhoea brought
on from drinking beer. In persons who have &nbsp;diarrhoea every
time they drink beer you will most likely find that Aloe will agree
with the symptoms, but sometimes it will be KALI-BI., for these two
remedies are very similar as to their stomach and bowel symptoms
"Belching with oppression of stomach." Here is another instance of
the tendency to capillary α venous engorgement. "Vomiting of blood"
and blood from the bowels.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There is much pain
in the hepatic region, burning and heat, etc. Mostly in the right
hypochondrium you will find distension and fullness. It is
pre-eminently a liver medicine. It is not as deep in its action as
SULPHUR. You will often find that Aloe will serve as a palliative
when it will have to be followed by SULPHUR, SUL-AC., KALI-BI. or
SEPIA, the medicines that follow Aloe and are complementary to it,
finishing its work. Aloe will make a good beginning in these liver
troubles when there is great fullness, distension, stitching pains
in the region of the liver and a dry, hot, burning skin, with no
increase of temperature. Aloe has some fever, but this sensation of
heat of the skin and dryness is without fever and is such as is
found in psoric patients. The proving has not been sufficiently
extensive to demonstrate whether Aloe produces eruption to any
extent or not, but if such could be proved this would place it
among the anti-psorics. It is not a deep long-acting constitutional
remedy like SULPHUR, and yet it is not so short-acting as ACONITUM
or BELLADONNA. Complaints come on only with a moderate degree of
rapidity. It may be associated very well with BRYONIA. BRYONIA,
does not go so deeply into the life substance as
SULPHUR.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Perhaps one of the
most striking features of the abdominal state is the fullness,
distension and rumbling. It seems as if the abdomen would burst and
the rumbling is so great that it can be heard by anyone in the
room. It keeps on one continuous gurgling. The stool gurgles out
with a noisy rumbling, like water out of a bung-hole. The text of
the earlier writers speaks of it as a sputtering, for while the
stool is passing out it is accompanied by much flatus which gurgles
and sputters. The abdomen seems to be as much distended as ever
even after great quantities of flatus have passed. There is no
relief. The pain is especially felt across the abdomen, about the
hips. Great distension as if the abdomen would burst across the
transverse colon, and also in the ascending and descending colon;
pain, gurgling, rumbling, heaviness, and feeling of pressure
outwards. "Twisting and griping pain in the upper abdomen, around
the navel, compelling him to sit bent up which relieves." "Feeling
of weakness in abdomen as if diarrhoea would result." The weakness
is sometimes very great, so much so that he is compelled to go to
bed with the diarrhoea, and you will often mistake it for
PODOPHYLLUM, so great is the exhaustion. PODO., has great
distension, tremendous gushing, much flatulence, great rumbling in
the bowel and the trouble comes on at 4 o'clock in the morning.
Aloe is like SULPH. again, in that it drives him out of bed in the
early morning with diarrhoea, and there are times when he puts the
feet out from beneath the covers to cool them off; the soles of the
feet burn and he uncovers them. Griping in the abdomen, feeling of
weakness in the abdomen. "Painfulness in whole abdomen, especially
in sides and along both sides of navel." So sensitive is the
abdomen that he can find no comfortable position. "Dull, abdominal
pain as after taking cold, morning and evening
repeatedly."</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Now here are
abdominal symptoms that relate to the condition of the woman and
not to diarrhoea. "Feeling as if a plug was wedged in between
symphysis pubis and of coccyx." "Labor-like pains in the groins and
loins worse when standing." Aloe has cured prolapsus of the uterus
of long standing when it was associated with fullness, heat of the
surface of the body, tendency to morning diarrhoea, dragging down
of the uterus and sensation of a plug wedged in between the
symphysis pubis and coccyx. The outward pressure of the uterus
causes that sensation. Dragging down as if all parts of the pelvis
would push out. A funnelling sensation in the vagina, in the
pelvis.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOOL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Urging to stool,
only hot flatus passes, giving relief, but urging soon returns."
The idea is that it compels him to go to stool, but when upon the
commode nothing but wind passes. It is useful also in old chronic
sufferers from this trouble, those who suffer from constipation,
who go many days without a stool, but feel every little while, or
several times in the day, that they must go to stool, and then only
a little wind passes. NAT-S., will very commonly overcome that
state. "Lumpy, watery stool." That is a strong feature of Aloe;
hard lumps mingled with a watery stool; the lumps are in the water
or in the liquid faeces; little hard lumps looking like marbles or
sheep dung.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the constipation
the stool is lumpy, like marbles. Sometimes these little nodules
remain in the rectum a long time without any urging to stool, and
finally escape unconsciously, being found in the clothing. Entire
loss of sensation in the anus, an anaesthesia; no feeling during
the passage of the stool.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">RECTUM</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Much of the Aloe
trouble is dysenteric in character, with a sharp, inflammatory
condition of the rectum and lower portion of the colon; bloody
discharges and yellow, jelly-like mucus. Sometimes the Aloe patient
will pass nothing but large quantities of this catarrhal,
jelly-like mucus. Don't forget Aloe for haemorrhoids that form like
a bunch of grapes. "Itching and burning in anus, preventing sleep."
He is compelled to bore with the finger into the anus; so violent
is the itching that the patient cannot let it alone; it seems it
will drive him to distraction. He gets relief only from applying
something cold. A common feature of Aloe is that ointments increase
the burning. There is increased burning of the skin round about the
ulcers after applying an ointment. The SULPHUR patient also cannot
bear any application; it is poisonous to him and he breaks out in
eruptions.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Wherever a mucous
membrane is inflamed there is formed a deposit of thick, jelly-like
mucus. If there is an ulcerated spot or aphthous patch or inflamed
surface, thick, jelly-like cakes of mucus may be peeled off almost
as thick as leather at times. At times the lower portion of the
rectum is in this state and the patient will say that the lumpy
stools are caked in jelly. The lumpy stools in GRAPHITES look as if
embedded in coagulated white of egg. Sometimes the Aloe patient,
before having a stool, will expel a teacupful of thick, jelly-like
mucus which has occupied the lower portion of the rectum. Aloe
cured a case of stricture of the rectum in which it was indicated
by this symptom. The stricture prevented nearly all the faecal
matter from getting down to the anus, but the rectum would fill up
three or four times a day and compel the patient to expel a
quantity of jelly-like mucus. The faeces that could be forced
through were scarcely larger than a pipe stem. It has been said
that our medicines are not capable of curing strictures, but they
sometimes do cure strictures. If they can cure the patient it is
marvellous how nature will take up all that inflammatory tissue and
the canal become normal. This thing has been seen many times in
stricture of the urethra and stricture of the rectum.</span></p>
