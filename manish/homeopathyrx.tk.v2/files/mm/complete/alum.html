<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">ALUMINA<br>
<br>
(Alum.)</span></span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This remedy comes in
very nicely after ALUMEN, which has much Alumina in its nature and
depends largely upon Alumina, which is its base, for its way of
working. It occurs to me to throw out a little hint. When you have
a good substantial proving of an oxide or a carbonate, and the
mental symptoms are well brought out, you can use these, in a
measure in a presumptive way, in prescribing another salt, with the
same base, which has a few mental symptoms in its proving. For
instance, you have a group of symptoms decidedly relating to
ALUMEN. The mental symptoms of ALUMEN, however, have not been
brought out to any extent, but still you have the mental symptoms
of the base of ALUMEN, which is the oxide, so that if the patient
has the mental symptoms of Alumina and the physical symptoms of
ALUMEN, you can rationally presume that ALUMEN will cure because of
the ALUMINUM in each.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">We know the mental
symptoms of Alumina fairly well. It especially takes hold of the
intellect and so confuses the intelligence that the patient is
unable to effect a decision; the judgment is disturbed. He is
unable to realize; the things that he knows or has known to be real
seem to him to be unreal and he is in doubt as to whether they are
so or not. In the GUIDING SYMPTOMS this is not so plainly
expressed, but in the CHRONIC DISEASES we have a record of this
which is the best expression of it that occurs anywhere. There we
read: "When he says anything he feels as if another person had said
it, and when he sees anything, as if another person had seen it, or
as if he could transfer himself into another and only then could
see."That is to say, there is a confusion of mind, a confusion of
ideas and thoughts. It has cured these symptoms. The consciousness
of his personal identity is confused. He is not exactly certain who
he was; it seemed as though he were not himself. He is in a dazed
condition of mind. He makes mistakes in writing and speaking; uses
words not intended; uses wrong words. Confusion and obscuration of
the intellect. Inability to follow up a train of
thought.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Then he enters into
another state, in which he gets into a hurry. Nothing moves fast
enough; time seems so slow; everything is delayed; nothing goes
right. Besides this he has impulses. When he sees sharp instruments
or blood, impulses rise up within him and he shudders because of
these impulses. An instrument that could be used for murder or for
killing causes these impulses to arise; impulse to kill
herself.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Alumina patient
is very sad, constantly sad. Incessantly moaning, groaning,
worrying, fretting and in a hurry. Wants to get away: wants to get
away from this place, hoping that things will be better; full of
fears. All sorts of imaginations. A sort of general
apprehensiveness. When he meditates upon this state of mind he
thinks he is going to lose his reason. He thinks about this frenzy
and hurry and confusion of mind, how he hardly knows his own name,
and how fretful he is, and he wonders if he is not going crazy, and
finally he really thinks he is going crazy.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Most of the mental
symptoms come on in the morning on waking. Sadness and weeping on
waking in the morning. His moods alternate. Sometimes his mental
state is a little improved and his mood changes into a quiet,
placid state, and again he goes into fear and apprehensiveness.
Some evil is going to take place and he is full of anxiety. Anxiety
about the future.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The next most
striking feature is the way in which the remedy acts upon the
nerves that proceed from the spine. There is a state of weakness of
the muscles supplied by these nerves; weakness over the whole body.
There is difficulty in swallowing, a paralytic condition of the
oesophagus; difficulty in raising or moving the arms; paralysis of
one side of the body, or paralysis of the muscles of the lower
extremities, or of the bladder and rectum. The paralytic state
begins as a sort of a semi-paralysis, for a long time merely an
inactivity, which grows at length into a complete paralytic
condition.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Everything is slowed
down. The conductivity of the nerves is impaired so that a prick of
a pin upon the extremities is not felt until a second or so
afterwards. All of his senses are impaired in this way until it
really means a benumbing of the consciousness and appears to be a
kind of stupefaction of his intellect, a mental sluggishness.
Impressions reach his mind with a marked degree of
slowness.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOOL-BLADDER</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The paralytic state
runs through the remedy and is observed in various parts in many
ways. The bladder manifests it in the slowness with which the urine
passes. A woman sits a long time before the flow starts, with
inability to press, and then the stream flows slowly. The patient
will say she cannot hurry the flow of urine. The urine is slow to
start and slow to flow, and sometimes only dribbles. At times it is
retained and dribbles involuntarily. This slowness is observed also
in the rectum. Its tone is lost and there is inability to perform
the ordinary straining when sitting at stool, and so paretic is the
rectum that it may be full and distended, and the quantity of
faeces enormous, and yet, though the stool is soft, there is
constipation. In this remedy there is often a hard stool, but we
notice that the remedy will do the best work where there is this
paretic condition of the rectum with soft stool. If the mental
symptoms, however, are present, such as I have described, with
large, hard and knotty or lumpy stool, Alumina will cure. Now, so
great is the straining to pass a soft stool that you will sometimes
hear a patient describe the state as follows: When sitting upon the
seat she must wait a long time, though there is fullness and she
has gone many days without stool; she has the consciousness that
she should pass a stool and is conscious of the fullness in the
rectum, yet she will sit a long time and finally will undertake to
help herself by pressing down violently with the abdominal muscles,
straining vigorously, yet conscious that very little effort is made
by the rectum itself. She will continue to strain, covered with
copious sweat, hanging on to the seat, if there be any place to
hang on to, and will pull and work as if in labor, and at last is
able to expel a soft stool, yet with the sensation that more stool
remains.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Of course a number
of other remedies have this straining to pass a soft stool, but
they have their own characteristics. Take for example an individual
who cannot keep awake; she says that it is impossible for her to
read a line without going to sleep; that she can sleep all the
time; she suffers night and day from a dry mouth, and the tongue
cleaves to the roof of the mouth. Now let her describe this state
of straining and struggling to expel a soft stool, and you hardly
need to go any further before you know the remedy. If that patient
in addition to what she has said tells you that she is in the habit
of fainting when standing any length of time, that she is disturbed
in a close room and has all sorts of complaints in the cold air, it
is NUX MOSCHATA. Now you see how easy it is for remedies to talk;
they tell their own story. Suppose a woman should come to you who
has been suffering from haemorrhagia, from prolonged oozing, who is
pallid and weak and is distended with flatulence, with much
belching and passing of gas, and the more she passes the worse she
feels, and she has these same symptoms of straining a long time to
pass a soft stool, tremendous effort with inactivity of the rectum.
You could do nothing but give her CHINA. By allowing remedies to
talk and tell their own story individualization is accomplished. I
have said all that to show that it is not upon the inactivity of
the rectum that you are to decide upon the remedy.
Individualization must be made through the patient. That is a
principle that should never be violated. You may have twenty
remedies all possessing a certain symptom, but if you have a few
real decided things that you can say about the patient, the manner
in which he does business, the manner in which the disease affects
the entire man, then you have something to individualize by. You
have seen the Alumina patient, the CHINA patient and the NUX
MOSCHATA patient. The sole duty of the physician is to treat the
sick, which means to study the patient himself until an idea of the
sickness is obtained.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">VERTIGO</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This medicine is
full of vertigo; he quivers, reels and "objects go round" almost
constantly. It corresponds to the vertigo of tired-out people, old
broken down patients, men worn out from old age. Vertigo also that
comes on when closing the eyes, as is found in spinal affections,
in sclerosis of posterior lateral columns. Alumina has produced
affections analogous to locomotor ataxia. It produces numbness of
the soles of the feet, the fulgurating pains, vertigo when closing
the eyes, and produces staggering and disturbances of coordination.
It is true that, &nbsp;in an early stage of locomotor ataxia
Alumina will check the disease process by bringing into order the
internal state of the economy. With ALUMINUM METALLICUM I have
stopped fulgurating pains in old incurable cases, and improved the
reflexes wonderfully, thus showing the general improvement of the
patient.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Most of the symptoms
are &lt; on rising in the morning. In the morning, as I have
mentioned it, the urine is slower to pass than after he has moved
about and warmed up a little. His limbs are stiffer in the morning
and in the morning he has to whip up his mental state. He wakes up
confused and wonders where he is. You will see that in children
especially-they wake up in the morning in a bewildered state, such
as you will find in Alumina, AESCULUS, LYCOPODIUM. He has to put
his mind on things to ascertain whether they be so or not, as to
how things should look and wonders whether he is at home or in some
other place.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD-NOSE</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There are many
headaches with nausea and vomiting. The headaches come whenever he
takes cold. This probably is due to the catarrhal state. The
Alumina patient suffers almost constantly from dryness of mucous
membranes, the nose is dry, stuffed up, especially on one side,
commonly the left. Nose feels full of sticks, dry membrane or
crusts, old atrophic catarrh, crusts in the posterior nares and in
the fossa of Rosenmuller. Large green, offensive crusts all through
the nose. Now comes the relation to the headache. Every time he
catches cold the thick yellow discharge slacks up and gives way to
a watery discharge and he has pain in the forehead over the eyes,
going through the head, with nausea and vomiting. So when it says
headache from chronic catarrh that is what it means. The headache
&gt; lying down. He has sick headaches and periodical headaches.
You will see that Alumina corresponds to a constitution that may be
called psoric-old, broken-down, feeble constitutions, scrofulous
constitutions, such as are inclined to tubercles and catarrhal
affections.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The catarrhal
tendency of this remedy is marked. Catarrhs are found wherever
mucous membranes exist. Alumina affects the skin and mucous
membrane extensively, i.e., the external and internal skin, the
surfaces of the body. The patient is always expectorating, he blows
the nose much and has discharges from the eyes. There is much
disturbance of vision belonging to this catarrhal state that may be
spoken of now. Dimness of vision, as if looking through a fog,
sometimes described as through a veil. A misty dimness of vision.
There is also disturbance of the muscles of the eye, of the muscles
of the ball and of the ciliary muscle. Weak and changeable vision.
The paralytic weakness, such as belongs to the whole remedy, will
be found in certain muscles, or sets of muscles, so that it is with
great difficulty that glasses can be adjusted. The activity of the
eye muscles is disturbed.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The catarrhal state
extends over into the back of the nose and the posterior nares are
filled up with tough mucus and crusts, and on looking into the
throat you will see that the soft palate and the mucous membrane of
the tonsils and pharynx and all parts that can be seen are in a
state of granulation, are swollen, congested and inflamed. The
pharynx feels dry and there is a chronic sensitiveness and
soreness. When swallowing food there is stinging and sensation as
if the throat were full of little sticks, especially after a
moment's rest, better by moistening and swallowing. In the night
air, after keeping still a while, there is an accumulation of ropy
mucus. This extends into the larynx with soreness in the larynx and
chest and chronic dry, hacking cough. The same catarrhal state
proceeds down into the oesophagus, so that it becomes sensitive and
clumsy. He swallows with difficulty. The bolus goes down with an
effort and he feels it all the way down. There is soreness and
clumsiness, paresis and difficulty of swallowing. This paralytic
weakness reminds the patient that he must put on a little force in
order to swallow and this swallowing is felt while the substance
goes down as if the oesophagus was sensitive.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It has a catarrhal
state of the stomach, bowels and rectum so that with the soft and
difficult stool there is often an accumulation of mucus. There is
also a catarrhal condition in the bladder, kidneys and urethra and
an old gonorrhoea will be prolonged into a catarrhal or gleety
discharge. Sometimes it is not a gleet, but the discharge remains
for many months and instead of its being a light milky white, such
as is natural in most prolonged cases of gonorrhoea, it remains
yellow and is painless. So it is with the vagina. The mucous
discharge from the vagina is a thick yellowish-white discharge,
sometimes excoriating. Thus we see, in the constitution we have
described, that an extensive catarrhal state belongs to the
remedy.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">SKIN</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">When we come to the
skin we find that it takes on a similar state of affairs. The
patient is subject to all sorts of eruptions. The skin withers,
becomes dry and is subject to eruptions, thickening, indurations,
ulcerations, cracking and bleeding. The eruptions itch worse in the
warmth of the bed. The skin itches, even when there is no eruption,
when becoming warm in bed, so that he scratches until the skin
bleeds. This presents an idea as to eruptions that you will have to
consider. A patient comes to you covered with crusts, and he says:
"When I get warm at night I have to scratch, and I scratch until
the skin bleeds." Now in Alumina it is very important to find out
whether these crusts were produced by the scratching or whether the
eruption came out as an itching eruption, for in Alumina in the
beginning there is no eruption, but he scratches until the skin is
off and then come the crusts. You must here prescribe not for the
eruption, but for the itching of the skin without eruption. Now in
MEZEREUM, ARSENICUM, DOLICHOS and Alumina the skin itches and he
scratches until it bleeds, and then he gets relief. Of course after
this there is an apparent eruption because crusts form. As soon as
the healing begins the itching begins, and he is only relieved when
the skin is raw. With the bleeding and moisture of the skin there
is relief of the itching. Now some of the books do not make the
distinction between itching without eruption and itching with
eruption, and hence mostly all young doctors get to thinking that
itching of the skin must always be associated with eruption, and
make a mistake in figuring out what kind of an eruption it is. The
skin thickens and indurates and ulcerates, and there are
indurations under the ulcers. There is a very sluggish condition of
both mucous membrane and skin with a tendency to induration.
Thickening of the mucous membrane will be found anywhere; after the
thickening come little ulcerations, and in the course of time
indurations are formed at the base of the ulcers. The same thing is
true of the skin. Dryness and burning run through everything and
may be said of all the mucous membranes and the skin in
general.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE-VISION-EAR-HEARING</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Chronic granular
lids. If we turn the eyelids down we will see that the mucous
membrane is thickened: Sometimes this thickening or hypertrophy
causes a turning out of the lids like ectropion. "The eyelashes
fall out;" that is in keeping with the general state. The hairs all
over the body fall out. Parts become entirely denuded of hair; the
hair of the scalp falls out extensively. All sorts of sounds in the
ears, buzzing, etc., and derangement of hearing; purulent
otorrhoea.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Point of nose
cracked" is in keeping with the remedy. Induration here and there
so that it favors lupus and epithelioma in one who is subject to
these swellings and eruptions. Alumina and ALUMEN, like ARS.,
LACH., SULPH. and CONIUM, are medicines that relate to these
troubles. Some of these have made brilliant cures where there is
infiltration. Upon the skin of the face and other parts of the body
there is crawling. Itching especially when getting warm. Sensation
of tension. Peculiar sensation about the face and other parts not
covered by clothing, a sensation of dried white of egg on the face,
of dried blood or cobweb on the face. If you have ever been going
through a place where there are cobwebs and a little cobweb has
strung across your face you will know what a peculiar sensation of
crawling it produces, and you cannot leave it alone until it is
removed. That sensation particularly belongs to Alumina, BORAX,
BAR-C. Little crawlings and creepings in the skin. Itching of the
face. These symptoms are so irritating that the patient will sit
and rub his face all the time. You will think that he is nervous.
He has the appearance of being nervous as he sits rubbing the back
of his hands. It is well to find out whether he does this because
he cannot keep his hands still or because of the itching. Because
of this itching sensation in the face he carries the hand to the
face as though to brush away something.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Perhaps I have not
said as much as should be said about the throat. "Ulcers in the
fauces, spongy, secreting a yellowish brown, badly smelling pus."
It may be said that the patient is often a victim of chronic sore
throat. There is this about Alumina, it has a special tendency to
localize itself upon mucous membranes. You will find in an Alumina
subject bleeding from all mucous membranes. He has catarrh of the
nose and red eyes, and his nose becomes stuffed up and he has many
acute colds; very severe throat trouble. Discharges from all of the
orifices. It is not a medicine that would be selected for a cold
settling in the throat, not a remedy for acute sore throat, but it
is a deep-acting antisporic and acts for months. Its greatest
usefulness is as a remedy for taking cold. In this respect it is
like SIL., GRAPH., and SULPH. It effects tissue changes, and it
does this slowly, for it is a slow-acting medicine. While the
patient himself with these deep-seated psoric affections feels
better generally after the remedy, it will be months before his
symptoms go away He may say: "I feel better, but my symptoms all
appear to be here. I can eat better and sleep better." Then it
would be unwise to change the remedy. You need not expect to get
immediate relief of the catarrhs and pains in the back and other
symptoms for which you gave this remedy. You may be satisfied if
you get the results after many weeks. You will find the same thing
in the paralytic weakness produced by PLUMBUM. There is a new drug
that is coming into use, the proving of which is very full and
rich, and it is analogous to the symptoms of this remedy. It is
CURARE. I wish we had a finer proving of it, but it is rich with a
great many things similar to Alumina and PLUMBUM, and especially in
the weakness of the hands and fingers of pianists. An old player
will say that after she has been playing for some time her fingers
slow down. The weakness seems to be in the extensors. Lack of
ability to lift the fingers; the lifting motion is lost. CURARE to
a great extent overcomes that, causes quickness to that lifting
power of the fingers. But this remedy also runs through in a
general way such paretic conditions; while CURARE is especially
related to a paralytic condition of the extensors more than the
flexors, the paralysis in Alumina is of both flexors and
extensors.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This medicine is one
of the few that have been found to be aggravated from starch,
especially the starch of potatoes. Aggravation from eating
potatoes. It has indigestion, diarrhoea, great flatulence and
aggravation of the cough from eating potatoes. It has also
aggravation from salt, wine, vinegar, pepper and from spirituous
drinks. Alumina is a spinal remedy and aggravation from spirituous
drinks is in keeping with some other spinal remedies. You find it
in ZINCUM. The ZINCUM patient cannot drink wine, for all of his
complaints are aggravated by it. This medicine is so sensitive and
so easily over-come by a small amount of liquor that he is obliged
to abandon it. He is not only intoxicated by it, but it aggravates
his complaints.</span></p>

has practically given out in this medicine. He is subject to
catarrh of the stomach, to ulceration of the stomach, to
indigestion from the simplest food. Sour and bitter eructations.
Vomiting of food, mucus or bile. Nausea, vertigo, heartburn, much
flatulence. Vomits mucus and water. Stomach is distended with gas.
The liver is full of suffering. Both hypochondria are full of
misery, but especially the right.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">When going over
ALUMEN I called attention especially to its antidotal relation to
LEAD. This remedy also will overcome the poisonous effects of lead
and sensitiveness to lead. Colic and paralytic weakness in lead
workers, painters and artists and in those who are so sensitive to
lead that from using hair wash containing lead they are paralyzed.
Not many years ago the acetate of lead was commonly used by women
for leucorrhoea, but it was found that so many were sensitive to it
that it was abandoned. Alumina is the most prominent antidote to
the affections which have come about through that sensitive
state.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There is so much
under stool and rectum that belongs to the general state that there
is scarcely anything left to be presented except some important
particulars. As you might suppose, this remedy has fissures; you
would naturally expect these when you consider what kind of mucous
membranes and tissues this patient manufactures. He suffers greatly
from constipation, he does much straining, the mucous membrane is
thickened and swollen, and hence we have a fissure. When you see a
remedy manufacturing and producing such a state upon the economy,
growing that kind of mucous membrane that would favor fissures, you
do not have to wait until you have cured a fissure with that remedy
to find out if it will suit the case. You do not have to resort to
the repertory to see what this remedy has done in fissure. From
your general knowledge of the medicine, you will see that it ought
to cure the patient, as it produces such a condition of the mucous
membrane and skin as would be naturally found in one who has a
fissure. The skin indurates and ulcerates and becomes clumsy and
unhealthy and constipation is produced, and so, after studying the
remedy in that way, you are not surprised if it cures a fissure.
You can also think over what other medicines have this state of the
economy and see what other remedies you would expect to cure a
fissure with. If you look into the nature of NITRIC ACID, CAUSTICUM
and GRAPHITES, you will see why they have had a wonderful record
for curing fissure. That is the way to study your Materia Medica;
see what it does to the man himself, to his organs and
tissues.</span></p>

<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The female has a
great deal of trouble that can be cured with this remedy, but her
troubles are mostly catarrhal. An instance of this is the
leucorrhoea; copious, acrid or excoriating, yellow leucorrhoea;
leucorrhoea so copious that it runs down the thighs, making the
parts red and inflamed. Ulceration about the os. The mucous
membranes are weak and patulous and ulcerate easily. All the parts
are in a state of weakness. There is dragging down from the relaxed
condition of the ligaments. Sensation of weight; the pelvic viscera
feel heavy. The discharges are commonly thick and yellow, but they
may also be albuminous, stringy, looking like white of egg, copious
and acrid; "transparent mucus." "Leucorrhoea, corroding, profuse;
running down to heels." It is more noticeable in the day time,
because these complaints are generally worse when walking or when
standing, which is not really an important symptom, but a common
condition. After menstruation it takes the woman nearly until the
next period to get straightened up. All her muscles are weak; there
seems to be no tonicity about her. It is highly suitable to women
drawing near the end of menstruation, about forty years of age; the
menstrual period prostrates, the flow is scanty, yet prostrating;
the sufferings are terrible and the patient is miserable at the
menstrual period. After menses, exhausted in body and mind, is a
strong feature of Alumina. It is a suitable remedy again when the
woman has a gonorrhoea which has been prolonged by palliation. She
has been made comfortable by partly suitable remedies, but it seems
that no remedy has been quite deep enough to root out the trouble,
for it keeps coming back. In a discharge that keeps returning,
better for a little while on PULSATILLA, and on this and that and
the other thing, and even on THUJA, given more especially because
it is gonorrhoea than because she is a sick woman. The patient is
tired and worn out, and when you come to look at the whole patient
and you see the paretic condition, the continued return of the
discharge that has been palliated by remedies, think of this
medicine in both the male and female.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The discharge is a
painless one in the male. The gonorrhoeal discharge has lasted a
long time, going and coming, until now there is left but a few
drops and it is painless. This remedy has cured many of these old
cases. Threatening chronic catarrh. The mucous membrane everywhere
is in a congested state and is weak.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A pregnant woman has
some trouble as well. A woman, who is not naturally a sufferer from
constipation, when pregnant becomes constipated, with all the
characterizing features of Alumina, i.e., the inactivity of the
rectum, no expulsive force; she must use the abdominal muscles,
must strain a long time. Again, the infant has a similar kind of
straining. You will see the new-born infant, or the infant only a
few months old, that will need Alumina. It is a very common
medicine for constipation in infants when you can find nothing
else; the child will strain and strain and make every effort to
press the stool out, and upon examining the stool it is found to be
soft, and should have been expelled easily.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The most striking
things we come to now are the cough and chest troubles. There is
expectoration in some of the coughs, but the cough is usually a
constant, dry, hacking cough, one of those troublesome lingering
coughs that has existed for years. It competes with ARG-MET. in its
character of the dry, hacking cough, especially associated with
weakness, but ARG-MET. has the cough in the daytime, which is not
so in Alumina. The Alumina cough is in the morning. Here is a
symptom that about covers the Alumina cough: "Cough soon after
waking in the morning." Every morning, a long attack of dry cough.
The cough is hard, a continued dry hacking, and she coughs until
she loses her breath and vomits, and loses the urine. This symptom
commonly occurs in the woman. "Dry, hacking cough with frequent
sneezing." It says in the text "from elongated uvula," but it
should read "from sensation of elongated uvula." It is a sensation
as if there were something tickling the throat; a tickling as if
the uvula were hanging down a long distance, and he will tell you
that his palate must be too long. Another expression which is the
same thing is "cough from sensation as of loose skin hanging in
throat." Sometimes those who do not know about the palate will talk
of something loose in the throat, while those who know they have an
uvula will generally call it the palate. But it is the same idea.
Tickling in the larynx, too. This is always quoted in singers. We
would think of Alumina when singers break down in the voice from
paralysis or from overwork of the voice. The voice lets down and
becomes feeble, and, when taking cold, there starts up a peculiar
kind of tickling. Alumina is very useful in these cases. ARG-MET.
was the remedy used by the earlier homeopaths for singers and
talkers with much trembling and letting down of the voice before
the value of Alumina was known in such conditions. Let me tell you
something here about RHUS-T, as I may not think of it again. Many
old singers, after taking cold, have a weakness left in the voice,
which they notice on beginning to sing. On beginning to sing the
voice is weak and husky, but after using it a little while it
improves. Give RHUS-T to all these patients, prima donnas, lawyers,
preachers, etc. They must warm up the voice and then they are all
right, but they say: "If I go back into the green room and wait a
little while, when I commence to sing again I am worse than ever."
The voice is better if they stay in a very hot room and keep it in
use. This fits into the general state of RHUS-T. There is a kind of
hoarseness that you may discover to be a little different from the
paralytic hoarseness of Alumina and ARG-MET. This hoarseness of
which I speak belongs to this same class of people; on first
beginning to use the voice it seems that they must get rid of some
mucus by clearing the throat until the voice can get to work. The
vocal cords on beginning to work are covered with mucus and on
getting rid of it they can do very good work, so long as they keep
at it. That is PHOSPHORUS. In such cases the use of the voice
becomes painful. The vocal cords are painful after motion and the
larynx is painful to touch. Sometimes this is so marked that it is
like stabbing with a knife on trying to use the voice. So we must
individualize hoarseness very extensively. Homeopathy is a matter

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">CHEST</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Soreness of the
chest, which is much increased by talking. There is weakness of the
muscular power of the chest. The lungs seem weak and the chest has
a sensation of weakness in it. Jar increases the misery of the
chest. The next most striking features will be in connection with
the back and limbs, and I have spoken of these in a general
way.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">BACK</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Burning in the
spine; much pain in the back. Burning and stitching pains in the
back. He expresses it as follows: "Pain in the back, as if a hot
iron was thrust through lower vertebrae." In myelitis this medicine
does wonderful work when there is a considerable amount of
spasmodic condition of the back as well, showing that the membranes
are involved. Another thing that belongs to this remedy that is a
well-known state in myelitis is the hoop sensation; sensation of
bandages here and there about the limbs and body is a common
symptom. A sensation of a tight cord around the body characteristic
of the most marked state of irritation and myelitis. Irritation of
the spinal cord with sensitive places. Burning places as if a hot
iron were forced into the spine. Pain along the cord, rending,
tearing pains in the cord with paralytic weakness, increasing
paralysis and complete paralysis; paralysis of one side of the
body.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EXTREMITIES</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Pain in sole of
foot on stepping, as though it were too soft and swollen."
"Numbness of heel when stepping." "Trembling of knees," this is a
mere matter of the general weakness. "Limbs go to sleep when
sitting." Whenever the limb is pressed against anything it will go
to sleep. Feeble circulation, feeble conductivity, feeble nerve
action; everything is slowed down. Arms and legs feel heavy. "Pains
in limbs as if bones were squeezed narrower, with pressure in the
joints." Now I will read some of the nerve symptoms which will
corroborate some of the things we have gone over. "Want of bodily
irritability." "Great exhaustion of strength, especially after
walking in open air." "One-sided paralysis, especially of the
extensors." "Rheumatic and traumatic paralysis in gouty patients."
Gouty patients with nodules in the joints; old broken down
constitutions with paretic exhaustion. "Excited condition of mind
and body." Tremblings here and there in the body. "Slow, tottering
gait as after severe illness." He must make slow motions, he cannot
hurry. "Involuntary motions."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">SLEEP</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There are all sorts
of dreams and disturbances in sleep, so that the sleep may be quite
disturbed and restless. Unrefreshing sleep, waking up with
palpitation of the heart.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Many dreams and
frequent awaking; starts in affright; muttering or crying." "During
sleep cervical muscles drew head backward;" this is in cases of
paralytic weakness; has to wake up, as the muscles of the back of
the neck pull so. Jerks in the back of the neck during
sleep.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">CHILL-FEVER</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Running through the
remedy very often, there is a great lack of animal heat, coldness,
and yet the patient wants to be in the open air; must be well
clothed and kept warm, but wants to be in the open air. The patient
takes cold continually from every change and draft. Sometimes the
patient will go to bed as cold as a frog, and when warm in bed is
so disturbed by itching and the warmth of the bed that there is no
comfort. These are two extremes coming together. The circulation is
so feeble over the extremities and backs of the hands that in cold
weather the hands are constantly cold and covered with cracks and
fissures that bleed.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The skin along the
shin bone is rough, ragged and itching. It has been said that dry
weather and dry, cold weather increase the complaints of Alumina,
and that wet weather sometimes ameliorates.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The febrile
condition of this remedy is not at all marked. There is not much
chill and not much fever, but the passive, slow, sluggish, chronic
elements and chronic symptoms are the ones that prevail most
markedly. In weak, broken-down cases there are some night sweats
and sweating towards morning. Slight chill in morning. Chill with
thirst.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">PERSPIRATION</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A striking feature
of the remedy is the chronic dryness of the skin. Sweat is rare and
scanty. This is not especially suitable for those copious,
exhaustive sweats. It is the very opposite of CALCAREA, which
sweats copiously, but this remedy, with spinal and paralytic
affections, is tired out from exertion, very exhausted, but does
not sweat. Pile on the covers to make him sweat if you will, but he
only gets hot and itching and does not sweat. Scanty sweat. Entire
inability to sweat.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">SKIN</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Chronic dryness of
the skin with fissures. The skin becomes worn and ragged and
fissured from its dryness. Great dryness of the thick skin over the
back of the hands, and in cold weather the hands become cold and
discolored.</span></p>
