<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">AMMONIUM
CARBONICUM</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Am-c.)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">If we were
practicing in the old-fashioned way and considered the wonderfully
volatile nature of Am- c. in some of its forms we would only look
upon it as an agent to relieve fainting and simple affections and
use it in the form of hartshorn to comfort old maids and some other
women. But Ammonium carbonicum is a deep-acting, constitutional
medicine, an anti-psoric. It effects rapid blood changes, it
disturbs the whole economy and it establishes a scorbutic
constitution. Its fluids are all acrid. The saliva becomes acrid
and excoriates the lips, so that they crack in the corners and
middle, and become raw and dry and scabby. The eye-lids fester and
become dry and cracked from the excoriating fluids from the eye.
The stool is acrid and excoriates. The genitals of the female
become raw and sore from the acrid menstrual discharge and
leucorrhoea, and wherever there is an ulcer upon the skin the
fluids that ooze from it excoriate the parts round about, this
excoriating character belonging to all of the exuding fluids and
discharges.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This remedy has
bleeding of black blood, often fluid blood, which will not
coagulate, flowing from the nose, the uterus, the bladder and
bowels. The blood is dark, showing that a great disturbance is
taking place in the circulation. The skin has a mottled appearance
intermingled with great pallor.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It produces a
violent action upon the heart, in which there is audible
palpitation, and every motion aggravates the pulsation. With this
is associated great prostration. It is rather a strange coincidence
that the ancients knew that Am-c. would overcome difficult
breathing from cardiac attacks and that aqua ammonias or hartshorn
is used today to a certain extent in indications similar to those
mentioned. They use it as a stimulant, but when indicated the
single dose very high is enough. The ancients knew enough, also, to
use hartshorn in the low forms of pneumonia, at the turning point
in the advanced stage; that is an old allopathic practice, but it
had a homeopathic relation to some of the cases. Once in a while
they would cure a patient in the awful stage of prostration with
heart failure at the end of pneumonia, and because they relieved
such a one it was then established as a remedy for all future
use.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Am-c. has a state
analogous to blood poisoning, such as we find in erysipelas and in
the most malignant forms of scarlet fever, with prostration, great
dyspnoea, so that it seems as if the heart were giving out. With
this there is an unusual patchy condition of the surface, due to
the paralytic condition of the blood vessels, enlargement of the
glands, duskiness and puffiness of the face. Am-c. has been used
allopathically in just such a state for centuries and it has
demonstrated its homeopathic relations by its efficacy.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It belongs to the
simple enfeeblement, weak heart, emaciation. There is quite an
absence of symptoms and a lack of response to remedies. The patient
must lie in bed because of the palpitation and difficult breathing
on motion. It is a matter of mere weakness. Such a case furnished
me much amusement for a year and a half. There was a woman in this
city who answered just such a description; her state was one of
peculiar cardiac weakness with dyspnoea and palpitation on
motion.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">I had been treating
the case, but had not fully studied it, and as she did not progress
under my management she was taken out of my hands and taken to one
of our most able neurologists, who put her upon the "rest cure" and
promised that in six weeks she would be perfectly well. But at the
end of six weeks she was worse than ever and a cardiac specialist
was then brought to examine her. He said it was true the heart was
not vigorous, but there was no organic affection and consequently
the case did not belong to his branch. Then a lung specialist was
brought in, and later she was examined by all kinds of specialists.
All of her organs were fully investigated, and it was announced
that nothing was the matter with them; but the poor woman could not
walk because of her sufferings and palpitating heart. She had a
little dry, hacking cough that did not amount to anything, but her
chest was examined and there was nothing wrong with it. But after
she had been in this continual fire for about three months, and was
steadily failing, the side of the family that were my adherents
prevailed against the others and I went to see her again. I
continued to study the case, which was extremely vague, having
nothing but those few symptoms, and finally I settled upon Ammonium
carbonicum, and she has been on this remedy for eighteen months.
She now climbs mountains; she does everything she wants to do and
is about ready to go to housekeeping. She has grown from a case of
nervous prostration, brain fag and any other diagnosis that might
have been heaped upon her to a well woman, and under that one
remedy. This shows you how deeply this remedy acts. One dose
generally acts upon her for six weeks to two months, steadily
improving her each time.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">RESPIRATION</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Exhaustion coming at
every menstrual period. An attack of cholera, or what one might
mistake for cholera, coming the first day of the menses; a copious
diarrhoea. Sometimes it is an exhaustion with vomiting, exhaustion
as in VERATRUM, with coldness, blueness, sinking, dyspnoea. The
kind of dyspnoea that I have been speaking of up to this time is
not an asthmatic dyspnoea; it is a cardiac dyspnoea, due to a weak
heart; but this remedy has also asthma, and in the asthma there is
this peculiarity: if the room is warm the dyspnoea increases until
suffocation seems imminent; as if he would die for want of breath.
He is compelled to go out into the cold air for relief. While the
warm room increases the dyspnoea in asthmatic complaints the bodily
state of the patient is worse from cold. The complaints of the body
and the headaches are worse from cold.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A common thing
running through this remedy is aching in the bones. The bones ache
as if they would break. The teeth ache violently from every change
of weather or from change of the temperature in the mouth. The jaws
ache or the roots of the teeth ache. A prominent feature is falling
out of the hair, the finger nails become yellowish, the gums settle
away from the teeth and bleed, the teeth become loose, all in
keeping with the scorbutic constitution.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This remedy has
hysteria, and it is not surprising that nervous women carry a
bottle of ammonia hanging to their chain. Many women do this
because as soon as they go into a close place they faint and must
use their hartshorn. This condition in the woman, if in a mild
degree, is not hysterical; it belongs to the sensitive nature of
women;</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">but if carried to a
more marked state it is hysterical. The hysterical fainting will be
averted by the use of the hartshorn. Am-c., will stimulate the
action of the heart and relieve.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The remedy is full
of depression of spirits. She weeps much, has fainting fits,
anxiety, uneasiness and exhaustion from motion. Oversensitive about
what she hears other people saying. Complaints from listening to
others talking. Complaints, both mental and physical, are worse in
the wet weather, and she is sensitive to cold, raw, wet weather.
The gouty complaints, nervous complaints, prostration, cardiac
complaints, dyspnoea, headaches, etc., come on in raw
weather.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A congestive
headache comes on in wet weather and from weather changes.
Sensation as if the brain would ooze out through the forehead and
eyes. "Pulsating, beating in the forehead as if it would burst,"
The headache is worse from stepping, especially the headaches that
come at the menstrual period. Headache worse in the morning. This
medicine in such headaches, with the symptoms I have described,
shows its antidotal relation to LACHESIS, because LACHESIS produces
all this state of prostration. In the old text-books you will
notice this expression, "Inimical to LACHESIS." This means when
LACHESIS has been given in high potency and has acted curatively,
Ammonium carbonicum, is not likely to act curatively after it, and
is sometimes capable of disturbing the case, confusing it and
mixing up the symptoms. But when LACH. has been given in too low
potency, and the patient has been poisoned with the crude medicine,
this remedy then becomes an antidote, used in a high potency,
because of the similarity in its action. It will overcome many of
the poisonous symptoms of the case. If you will examine the
appearance of people who have been bitten by snakes and then
examine the pathogenesis of this remedy you will see a great
similarity between them. It is well known that this remedy has had
repeated use in snake bites. Evidently it did not save all of them,
but it must have done something for these cases or it would not
have established so great a reputation for itself. Give it not as
an antidote PER SE, but when indicated in blood-poisoning and
animal bites with zymosis, with a tendency to black liquid
bleeding, as in ELAPS. Running through the snake poisons there is a
tendency to bleeding of black blood that will not
coagulate.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE-VISION</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It has many eye
symptoms. Sparks before the eyes in connection with headaches;
double vision; aversion to light. "Large, black spot floats before
the eyes after sewing." When these symptoms have been present in
such a constitutional state as I have described the remedy has
cured cataract; it has cured the patient and finally the
crystalline lens has cleared up. Burning of the eyes, smarting
eyes, blood-shot eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EAR-HEARING</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It disturbs the
hearing, causing hardness of hearing and discharge of acrid fluid
from the ears.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">We have had
scorbutic, catarrhal condition of the nose, such as described.
Discharge from the nose acrid. "Severe pain as if the brain were
forcing itself out just above nose." "Nose-bleed when washing face
or, hands in morning." It has many complaints from bathing, and a
prominent feature is that the skin is covered with red, mottled
spots after bathing. Bathing produces surging all over, here and
there, as well as nose-bleed. Palpitation is worse from
bathing.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">THROAT</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the throat we
have an appearance like malignant scarlet fever, diphtheria and
other zymotic states; purple, swollen, ulcerated and bleeding, and
gangrenous, accompanied by great exhaustion, with enlarged tonsils
and glands. The glands outside of the throat and neck are enlarged
and felt as lumps. In diphtheria, when the nose is stopped, the
child starts from sleep gasping for breath. Here again we observe
its relation to LACHESIS and the ophidia, for soon after the
patient drops to sleep he wakes up suffocating. In diphtheria, in
chest troubles with great prostration, the patient is worse after
sleep.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-FEMALE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Menses too soon.
"The menstrual blood is blackish, often in clots." The leucorrhoea
is acrid. "Violent tearing in abdomen and vagina." "Irritation of
clitoris." Swelling of the genitals. Now, let me tell you something
not mentioned here, but important, and that is a sensation of
soreness in the whole pelvic viscera; at times it seems as if all
her inner parts were raw. It is a sensation of soreness; not always
sore to touch. This sensation of deep-seated soreness is especially
felt during menstruation. All through the menstrual period soreness
and rawness. "Menses premature, abundant, blackish, often in clots,
preceded by griping and colic."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">COUGH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The remedy is full
of catarrhal symptoms and cough, with much rattling of mucus in the
chest and air passages. Oppression of breathing, a catarrhal
dyspnoea. Especially is this a remedy, when the symptoms agree, in
hypostatic congestion of the lungs, a filling up of the chest with
mucus which it is difficult to expel; great rattling in the chest
and great weakness. It is a good palliative in the last stages of
consumption. A dose of Am-c., when there is great coldness,
prostration and weakness in the chest. It is not unlike that
sensation of weakness in the chest which is like STANNUM. He can
hardly cough out loud, and because of the weakness he cannot expel
the mucus, like ANT-T. Short asthmatic cough.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The complaints of
this remedy come on especially at three o'clock in the morning. The
cough comes on at that time. Old people who suffer from catarrh of
the chest have an aggravation at three o'clock in the morning with
the palpitation and prostration, waking up at that hour with cold
sweat and dyspnoea. Almost pulseless; weakness of the heart. Face
pale and cold.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Great lassitude."
Defective reaction with, or at the close of, severe zymotic
troubles, typhoid, diphtheria, scarlet fever, erysipelas, etc. In
those complaints that should come to a crisis, if the patient goes
into a state of great exhaustion under remedies fairly well
selected, you have an instance where this medicine competes with
ARSENICUM for the nervous prostration. You see "heart failure"
spoken of in old school literature. They say the patient got along
very nicely, but finally died of heart failure. In a great many
instances if Ammonium carbonicum were given in time it would save
life.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Averse to walking
in open air." "Children dislike washing." The warmth of the bed
relieves the rheumatic pains, relieves the chill. "In a warm room
the headache is better." "From washing reappearance of the
symptoms; nose-bleed; blue hands; swollen veins." "Worse in cold
air."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">SKIN</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">We come now to the
appearance of the skin: "Body red as if covered with scarlatina."
"Putrid flat ulcers with a pungent sensation." "Malignant
scarlatina with somnolence, starting from sleep." "Erysipelas of
old people when cerebral symptoms are developed." Whenever treating
a severe form of disease and an eruption comes to the surface, like
a carbuncle or erysipelas, and does not give relief to the patient
then there is danger. A remedy must be found soon. When a patient
is coming down with severe internal troubles it is not a very
uncommon thing for unhealthy looking boils to come out, or
carbuncles or erysipelas blotches. It is always serious when these
are not immediately followed by relief to the patient. It shows a
pernicious state that has been pent up and cannot be held any
longer and this violence is going to destroy. This is one of the
remedies that you may look for to check the progress of such
states. Any remedy, of course, which corresponds to the totality of
the symptoms, is the remedy to administer.</span></p>
