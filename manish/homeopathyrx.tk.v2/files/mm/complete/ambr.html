<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">AMBRA
GRISEA</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Ambr.)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">On looking over this
remedy as a whole it will appear to you that you have been studying
the characteristics of one PREMATURELY OLD. You will often see
symptoms coming on in one at fifty years of age that should appear
at eighty, and after studying this remedy you will see that the
same aspect is presented, a premature old age. We recognize
trembling and a peculiar kind of feebleness that cannot be
described by any expression but senility; it is not the confusion
of mind belonging to sickness, but the peculiar state we recognize
in old people, in declining life; trembling and tottering and a
dreamy state of mind with forgetfulness. He goes on from one
subject to another, asking a question, and, without waiting for it
to be answered, asking another. And so he jumps about from one
topic to another. It can hardly be said to be confusion, it is a
dreamy state of mind, a state of senility. This remedy is useful
when such a state is found in young persons, when the mind is not
insane and yet it is weak. Especially is it indicated in those
persons who manifest a momentary, fleeting inquisitiveness, JUMPING
FROM ONE SUBJECT TO ANOTHER. Often a patient asks me one question
after another, never waiting to have the first one answered, a
flitting, flighty talker, who does not seem to realize that I have
not answered his questions; that patient, I say to myself, needs
Ambra grisea. That state of mind belongs to modern society women in
such great frequency that you will be astonished to note it on all
hands. A modern society belle that could not darn the heel of her
stocking to save her soul will in a few years get into just that
state, and even Ambra will not cure her. But there is a kind of
nervous sickness manifested by these symptoms that Ambra grisea
will cure. Alternation of depression of spirits with vehemence of
temper is another feature. That naturally belongs to old age. A
period of greatest excitability is often followed by depression, a
state of indifference to all things, to joy, to grief, to people,
etc., treating with indifference things that would naturally break
the heart of a well-balanced person. He does not even wonder why he
is not excited over these wonderful things, so decided is the state
of indifference. Many of the complaints are WORSE IN THE MORNING.
He gets up with confusion and dulness of mind and is in a dreamy
state and towards evening he takes on symptoms of
insanity.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Ambra is one of the
most frequently indicated medicines in simple, nondescript VERTIGO
of old men. So dizzy that they cannot go out on the street; so
dizzy upon getting up in the morning that they must wait a while
until they can get around on their feet. It is the dizziness
belonging to senility and to premature old age. Now, when this man
undertakes to meditate upon something his ideas are whisked away.
It is a sort of confusion with VANISHING OF IDEAS. He has to make
an unusual effort a few times to bring his thoughts back to the
place before he can concentrate the mind to meditate upon some
idea.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">But while
concentration of the mind is difficult, he is compelled to sit and
DWELL UPON THE MOST DISAGREEABLE THINGS that force themselves upon
him and he cannot get rid of them. It is somewhat analogous to
NAT-M., but the peculiar feature of NAT-M. is that she delights to
dwell upon past unpleasant occurrences and lies awake at night
thinking about them. Ambra grisea is forced to dwell upon such
things. Images, false faces, hideous imaginations, fancies and
visions annoy him and keep him awake. In the semi-dreamy state he
is kept holding up before his mind these grimaces. Such a state of
mind may come on from business embarrassments with vertigo,
congestion to the head and brain fag.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">One thing running
through this remedy is that the PRESENCE OF OTHER PERSONS
AGGRAVATES THE SYMPTOMS; also the MARKED AGGRAVATION FROM
CONVERSATION. A woman, when attended by a nurse, is unable to have
a stool without sending the nurse into another room. In spite of
much straining she can do nothing unless alone. It is said in
NAT-M. that the patient cannot urinate in the presence of other
persons. The urine will not start when anyone is around. That is a
sort of general feature of this remedy. Confusion of mind and
embarrassment in the presence of other persons. Embarrassment in
company. As soon as he goes into company there is flushing,
trembling, nervous excitement and the thoughts vanish. With these
symptoms the patient imagines that he is going out of his mind, and
finally he settles down into a state of MELANCHOLY, sadness and
despair, and does not want to live. He loathes his life and wants
to die. "Great sadness." "Melancholy, sits for days weeping." Such
is the mental state of this prematurely old patient with broken
down constitution. It is a picture of a wreck and the question will
arise when you find a patient that looks and acts in this way
whether you have received him in time to cure him. You readily see
you have before you one who is going down hill and going into
insanity of one form or another. A physician sees the forerunner of
a great breakdown when he sees an Ambra grisea patient with the
nervous mental state, the quivering, trembling and excitement in
one who was once a strong, vigorous man. Some great business or
domestic shock has come upon this patient. It is not the aspect you
see when phthisis is coming on; you do not see the cachectic
condition, but it is a prostration of the nervous system, a mental
prostration. A man goes through the trial of one death after
another in the family and there seems to be nothing remaining; he
cannot look at it philosophically; he has lost his business and his
friends and then he takes on dreaminess and wonders whether life is
worth living. Then it is you get the Ambra grisea
aspect.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">VERTIGO</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Many of the
complaints come on in the MORNING and many come on AFTER EATING.
"Vertigo with feeling of weight on vertex; worse after sleep," but
especially in the morning. It is not mentioned in the text, but it
is also worse after eating. "Had to lie down on ACCOUNT of vertigo
and feeling of weakness in stomach."</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Running through the
nervous symptoms we have MUSIC is INTOLERABLE; music makes him
tremble, aggravates his mental symptoms and gives him pain in the
back as from a hammer. A number of physical symptoms are brought
out by listening to music. The tones seem as if they were a
material substance taking hold of him.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Complaints are often
ONE-SIDED; perspiration on one side of the body or perspiration on
the affected side. "On right side of head, a spot where hair when
touched pains as if sore." The same sensation is in the skin,
oversensitive to touch. "Scalp feels sore in the morning when
awaking; this is followed by a sensation of numbness." The word
NUMBNESS you will find running through the complaints. You will
find a peculiar kind of numbness, such as belongs to old people.
Diminished sensibility of the parts; feeble circulation.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Again, we find under
the eye symptoms, "Dulness of vision as if from looking through a
mist." There is dimness of vision coming on without any condition
in the eye that would justify it. It is a nervous dimness of
vision, a senile paralysis coming on. "Itching on eyelid as if a
sty was forming." ITCHING is felt all over the body; itching in all
the little openings.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Among the symptoms
that are not in the text and that are decided symptoms belonging to
this remedy are, "Pressing headache starting from both temples,
drawing and tearing in the head, to and fro. Shooting through the
head, lancinating, cutting pains, worse on exertion, better from
quiet and lying. Headache when blowing nose. Pressing pain in the
left frontal eminence and in the eye. Burning in the right eye and
in the eye-lids. Tearing in short streaks in and upon the right
eye, pressure on the left eye-brow, shooting, aggravated after
eating; lachrymation." These are in the original provings, but not
in the text; they have been left out. This is the case all through
the GUIDING SYMPTOMS; important symptoms were left out because it
was necessary to cut down the work.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEARING</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Hearing decreases."
Dullness of hearing without any organic affection of the ear. So
perverted is his ability to hear that music aggravates his
symptoms, that is through the nerves of hearing. "Listening to
music brings on congestion to head." Music aggravates his cough.
Think of one commencing to cough simply because he hears music!
What a strange thing that is! CALCAREA has such sensitiveness that
the stroke of the piano is painful in parts, especially in the
larynx.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This remedy is full
of BLEEDING. Copious bleeding from the nose in the morning. There
we get the morning aggravation again. We get the idea of the feeble
circulation because of the easy oozings from mucous membranes.
"Copious nose bleed early in bed." "Dried blood gathered in nose."
"Long continued dryness of the nose, frequent irritation as from
sneezing." In the nose an old, dry catarrh with atrophic condition
of the mucous membrane. The nose inside becomes shiny and
withered.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">THROAT</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Dryness of the mouth
without thirst. Biting pain in the throat between the acts of
swallowing. Rawness in the throat. The throat complaints are worse
in the morning. Complaints are worse after eating and worse from
warm drinks, especially from warm milk. "After eating, cough and
gagging." There is a peculiar combination of symptoms about the
throat. Dryness and accumulation of mucus in the throat which he
tries to expel, and when making an effort to cough out the mucus he
gags and sometimes vomits. Vomiting from cough. Weakness at the pit
of the stomach after every evacuation; an "all-gone" feeling in the
pit of the stomach. Pressure deep in the region of the liver; worse
in the morning; worse after eating; worse after stool. Distension
of the abdomen with great flatulence, especially after eating. Some
symptoms are worse after drinking. Sometimes these complaints come
on in the middle of the night, rousing him up with rumbling and
cutting in the bowels. The abdomen is cold; it feels as if the
whole inside of the abdomen were cold. At other times the coldness
seems to be on one side of the abdomen.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOOL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Inveterate
CONSTIPATION in old persons, and especially when it is impossible
to have anyone near at the time of stool. "Frequent ineffectual
desire for stool; this makes her very anxious; at this time
presence of other persons becomes unbearable." After the normal
stool there is pressure in the abdomen or a sense of emptiness and
weakness in the abdomen which is better after passing flatus or
eructation.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">URINE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Bloody URINE with
red sediment in the urine. Urine when emitted is clouded,
yellowish-brown and deposits a brownish sediment. "Sour-smelling
urine." The urine is copious. "During urination burning, smarting,
itching and titillation in the urethra and vulva." "Sore rawness
between the thighs." "Voluptuous itching on scrotum." "Violent
morning erections without desire," with numbness of the genitals.
The symptoms are most erratic, as much so as in IGNATIA and NAT-M.
Taken as a whole they can be reconciled, but taken a few at a time
they seem wonderfully inconsistent. You must get the whole remedy
in order to comprehend it.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-FEMALE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Copious discharge of
blood between the menstrual periods. "Discharge of blood between
periods at every little accident." Discharge of blood from the
vagina from pressing at hard stool; even from a walk that is a
little too long or from too great exertion. "During menses left leg
becomes quite blue from distended varices, with pressive pain in
leg." "Lying down aggravates uterine symptoms," quite an unexpected
thing. Menses too early and too profuse. "Menses appear seven days
before time," and then comes that horrible itching of the genitals;
"soreness and itching with swelling of labia."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">LARYNX AND TRACHEA
–RESPIRATION-COUGH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Another marked
feature of this remedy that you might expect with all this nervous
excitement and prostration is dyspnoea with cardiac symptoms,
difficult breathing, and a sort of asthma. It comes on from any
little exertion. Asthma on attempting coition.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Itching, scraping
and soreness in larynx and trachea." "Titillation in throat, larynx
and trachea." Everywhere there is itching, and the itching is very
often a form of crawling. "Asthma of old people and children," in
feeble, tremulous, weakly ones. "Whistling in chest during
breathing." "Spasmodic cough." "VIOLENT SPASMODIC COUGH WITH
FREQUENT ERUCTATIONS AND HOARSENESS." A good deal of this cough is
of nervous origin. It is a cough with excitement, with nervousness,
with trembling, which would make one of considerable experience
wonder if that patient did not have brain and spinal cord trouble.
Nervous cough, such as occurs often in spinal irritation. Cough
from constriction of the larynx followed by copious flow of white
mucus. This is a paroxysmal cough, much like whooping cough.
Asthmatic dyspnoea from any little exertion, from music, from
excitement. Cough with congestion of blood to the head. Cough from
thinking and from anxiety.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It is not very long
after these symptoms show themselves before this patient will
emaciate and wither, until the skin looks like dried beef. With all
he is a tremulous and shaky patient.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">CHEST</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">He complains a great
deal of tearing pressure deep in the left side of the chest.
Sensation of rawness in the chest and itching in the chest.
Titillation and itching, moving about here and there if he tries to
touch the place and scratch it.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">You will not be
surprised to know that this patient suffers from palpitation of the
heart upon slight exertion, from excitement, from music, from any
effort to put the mind on anything, with trembling and quivering.
And this palpitation he notices even to the extremities; he throbs
all over. His extremities pulsate. He is conscious of his arteries
everywhere and the palpitation of his heart causes oppression of
breathing.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EXTREMITIES</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The limbs easily
become numb; pressed upon in the slightest manner they go to sleep;
go to sleep on being crossed. Coldness, trembling and stiffness of
the extremities. The finger nails become brittle and are
shrivelled. The arms go to sleep when lying down. "Sore and raw
between the thighs and in hollow of knees." Heaviness of lower
limbs, paralytic weakness; the patient is growing old; senility is
coming on. This remedy has cured the premature trembling that comes
on in middle-aged persons. It has cured the "going to sleep" and
numbness and feeble circulation with loss of muscular power. It is
very suitable in children who are excitable and nervous and weak.
"In lean persons."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
