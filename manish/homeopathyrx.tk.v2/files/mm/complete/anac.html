<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">ANACARDIUM
ORIENTALE</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Anac.)</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MENTAL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This remedy is full
of strange notions and ideas. The mind appears to be feeble;
almost, if not complete imbecility; seems as if in a dream;
everything is strange; slow to comprehend. Marked irritability;
disturbed by everything; cursing. Weak memory. Forgetful of things
in his mind but a moment ago. All his senses seem to vanish and he
gropes around as if in a dream. Change of states; alternate states.
Dullness and sluggishness of the mind prevail. He is in a
continuous controversy with himself. Irresolution marks his
character. He cannot settle between doing this and that, he
hesitates and often does nothing. He cannot decide, especially in
an action of good or evil. He hears voices commanding him to do
this or that, and seems to be between a good and an evil will. He
is persuaded by his evil will to do acts of violence and injustice,
but is withheld and restrained by a good will. So there is a
controversy between two wills, between two impulses. When this is
really analyzed by one who knows something of the nature of man it
will be seen that the man is disturbed in his external will, but
the internal will cannot be affected by medicine. His external
voluntary is continuously excited by external influences, but his
real will, in which is his conscience, restrains that and keeps him
from carrying the impulses into effect. This can only be observed
when its action is on a really good man. He has a controversy when
his external will is aroused, but in an evil man there is no
restraint and he will not have this symptom.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Hallucinations; a
demon sits on one shoulder and an angel on the other. He is
disposed to malice and has an irresistible desire to curse and
swear. Laughs when he should be serious. So it is carried on until
all things in the external will are inverted. Internal anxiety,
i.e., the internal will is in turmoil over this external
disturbance. "Contradiction between will and reason" is an attempt
to express what the individual knew nothing about. "Feels as though
he had two wills." That is better. It finally destroys or paralyzes
the external will, and when a man is naturally evil and is under
the paralyzing influence of Anacardium he will do acts of violence.
A wicked man is restrained, not by his conscience, but by fear of
the law. Anacardium paralyzes the external will and places him in a
position of imbecility, and he does acts of violence from his own
natural perverted self. It has so acted on a portion of the mind
that it teaches a great deal. I have learned much from Anac, AURUM
and ARGENTUM of the strange action of medicines on the human mind.
Psychology must be figured out by the action of drugs on the human
mind. By this means we get as facts and can lay aside many
hypotheses.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Ideas as if nothing
were real; all seems to be a dream. Fixed ideas. He thinks he is
double. This comes from a vague consciousness that there is a
difference between the external and internal will, a consciousness
that one will is the body and another is the mind. Dwells on
thoughts about salvation. That a stranger is by his side is another
recognition of the two wills. Those strange forms accompany him,
one to his right side and one to his left. This mental state drives
him to madness.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Alternation of his
moods and understanding. One moment he sees a thing and another
moment he does not understand it. One moment she sees it is her
child and another that it is not. One moment it is a delusion and
next moment it is an illusion. One moment thinks it is so and next
moment has enough reason left to know that it is not so. Delusion
is an advanced stage of illusion. In the Repertory we have the same
remedies often in illusion and delusion; it is a matter of grade.
When the intellect is slightly affected it is an illusion, and what
he sees he knows is not so. He sees demons, and at first he knows
from his intelligence that a demon is not there, but later, he
wants you to drive him out. It does not matter which, they are
similar symptoms, and it is a matter of degree, and so, in the
Repertory, delusions and illusions are not given separate
places.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Anac, HYOS., STRAM.
and BELL., are important in bringing out the quality of the
perverted human mind as to the intelligence and affections.
Whenever a medicine makes a man desire to do something it affects
his will, and when it affects his intelligence it is acting on his
understanding. Medicines act on both.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Low-spirited,
disheartened, fears he is pursued, looks for thieves, expects
enemies, fears everything and everybody. Full of internal anxiety.
No peace. He is separated from the whole world, and he despairs to
do that which is required of him. Cowardly in the extreme. Fears
some dreadful thing will happen. Morose, sulky, sullen. Unsocial;
complains of weak memory. Slight causes make him excessively angry.
A strong feature is that all moral feeling is taken out of him. He
feels cruel. Can do bodily injury without feeling. Cruel,
malicious, wicked.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Bad effects of
mental excitement. Weak-minded. Consequences of fright and
mortification. Suitable in religious mania when the conflict
between the external and internal will is kept up. It is analogous
to HYOS.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Many complaints are
ameliorated by eating.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">PHYSICAL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Sensation here and
there of pressure, described as of a plug, all through the body, in
the head, eyes, in the navel and down the spine. Objects appear too
far off. Things have a strange look, sometimes uncanny. Illusions
of smell, burning timber, pigeon's dung. Chronic dry
coryza.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The whole body has
been well covered by symptoms; but it seems that the mind
represents the principal aspect, and it will seldom be used
excepting for such mind symptoms. Usually when the mental symptoms
are strong the physical are also covered by the remedy.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Full of trembling
and paralytic weakness. Tetanus; epilepsy. Sensations as of a hoop
or band around the body, limbs or head; pressing as of a
plug.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The eruptions are
like RHUS-T in many respects; erysipelatous eruptions dark, dusky
and of malignant types. It is an antidote to RHUS-T. poisoning.
Eruptions all over. Yellow vesicles are common. Intense itching of
eruptions. Warts on the palms like NAT-M. Skin burns much. It seems
closely related in its symptoms to all the RHUS. family.</span></p>
