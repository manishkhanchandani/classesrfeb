<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">ANTIMONIUM
TARTARICUM</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Ant-t.)</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">FACE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">About the first
thing we see in the study of an Ant-t., patient is expressed in THE
FACE. The face is pale and sickly; the nose is drawn and shrunken;
the eyes are sunken and there are dark rings around the eyes. The
lips are pale and shrivelled. The nostrils are dilated and
flapping, and there is a dark, sooty appearance inside of the
nostrils. The face is covered with a cold sweat and is cold and
pale. The expression is that of suffering. The atmosphere of the
room is pungent, more pungent than foetid or putrid, and makes you
feel that death is in it. The family is disturbed; they are going
hither and thither, and the nurse is in an excited and busy state,
and you enter upon this scene to make a homeopathic prescription.
It is one of excitement and one that you cannot act rapidly in, but
one in which you must make a very quick prescription. These things
will interfere somewhat with your thinking at the time that you
must do the best thinking and the most rapid thinking.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">COUGH-EXPECTORATION-CHEST</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Now, in what kind of
cases do we find this state and appearance, where all the features
and symptoms conform to the nature of the remedy? First, in
CATARRHAL PATIENTS, in broken down constitutions, in feeble
children, in old people. Catarrhal conditions of the trachea and
the bronchial tubes. Our ears being open we hear COARSE RATTLING
and bubblings in the chest. If you have ever been in the room of
the dying you have heard what is called the death rattle. It is
coarse like that. Now and then there is expectoration of a mouthful
of light-colored, whitish mucus. The condition is one in which the
chest is steadily filling up with mucus, and at first he may be
able to throw it out; but finally he is suffocating from the
filling up of mucus and the inability of the chest and lungs to
throw it out. It is a paralytic condition of the lungs. It may
occur in cases of grippe. At first it may be a case that comes on
quite rapidly, running a rapid course. It may be a case that
produces early prostration, that is, in three or four days or a
week. The first few days of the sickness will not point to Ant-t.
So long as the reaction is good and his strength holds up you will
not see this hippocratic countenance, sinking, and coldness and
cold sweat. You will not hear this rattling in the chest, because
these symptoms are symptoms that indicate a passive condition.
Ant-t., has weakness and lack of reaction. Hence we see that it is
suitable in those cases that present this state, or in such
patients as are so feeble, when they are taken down, that they at
once enter upon a passive or relaxed state. In cases of bronchitis
with pneumonia, inflammation of the trachea, inflammation of the
air passages in general, the inflammation is likely to be attended
with dryness or a scanty flow of mucus. If this be violent in a few
days it will reach a state of relaxation and weakness. But the
first state does not indicate Ant-t. Such medicines as BRYONIA and
IP. come in for the first period, and your impression is, when
administering those medicines, that they will be sufficient for the
whole case, and they will be, except in those states wherein this
weakness is present from the beginning, or where there is lack of
ability to react sufficiently from your remedy to recovery under
it. Then comes in a second remedy, and that is the time when this
medicine begins its operation.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">IP. has some of this
coarse rattling, but it is attended with great expulsive power of
the lungs. This medicine has the coarse rattling that comes after
many days. IP. has it the first days of the sickness. This remedy
has the coughing and gagging and retching, but in the stage of
great relaxation, prostration and coldness. It seems as if he will
die. When you hear him cough you are at once impressed with the
idea that there must be some profound weakness in his lung power.
We know that it is in the power of the lungs to produce an
expulsive action with the deep inspirations. They have no such
power in Ant-t. The chest is full of mucus and it rattles; the
cough is a rattling cough, but the mucus does not come up, or only
a small quantity comes up, but it does not relieve him. His chest
is full of mucus, he is suffocating and he is really passing away,
dying from carbonic acid poisoning due to a lack of expulsive
power. In cases of pneumonia; when first coming down with a chill,
it may be a very violent attack, such an attack as from its
violence produced prostration early, that is, after three or four
days. It is not indicated in the beginning during the chill, and
during the high grade of inflammation, but during the stage of
exudation. But the violence of the attack leads him to a state of
prostration, or he is already feeble as if he was old, and
therefore he becomes easily relaxed and prostrated from the
disease. Altogether unlike ACON., BELL., IP. and BRY., for they
come down with violence-the very opposite is present in Ant-t.
Little fever, cold sweat, coldness, relaxation, hippocratic aspect.
So it is the remedy that closes out the scene with the severe cases
of bronchitis, pneumonia; most of these cases die in an
Ant-t.state. This patient is an old GOUTY PATIENT, debilitated from
long illness, always shivering, pale, with enlarged joints. Every
spell of wet weather brings on a catarrhal state of the chest,
larynx and trachea, which runs into a state of copious secretion of
mucus. He is in bed at once, prostrated, with coarse rattling. In
children that have frequent attacks of bronchitis, from cold wet
weather, from cold rainstorms in the autumn, in the spring and in
cloudy weather. No sooner do they get over one cold than another
cold comes on. The acute stage is never violent with them, but they
keep having these passive rattling colds. Recurrent rattling in the
chest. Chilly and pale. Those florid children that do not look sick
when they have a cold, are more or less vigorous, who have rattling
in the chest, but do not come down with weakness and are not
prostrated from it, but keep on rattling, they call for KALI-S.
That is quite a distinguishing feature, the weakness at once speaks
for this remedy. In VERY OLD PEOPLE this weakness occurs, old
broken down people who have for years had CATARRH OF THE CHEST.
Every sharp cold spell in the winter brings on catarrh of the
chest, with thick white mucus, and attended with great dyspnoea,
driving him to bed. He must sit up in the bed and be fanned; cannot
lie down because of the difficult breathing and filling up of the
chest. Ant-t., will ease him over a number of these attacks before
he dies. When the mucus is yellow and purulent in one of these old
people, AMMONIACUM will tide him over a good many winters. We see a
good many old people that suffer from catarrh of the chest during
the winter; they have had it for years, and do not expect to be any
better. When the expectoration is yellow AMMONIACUM will pull them
through, and Ant-t., when it is white and attended with
prostration, sweat, coldness, pallor and blueness of the face.
These are the principal uses of this remedy in practice. It has
many pains and aches. To a great extent Ant-t. builds upon the
ANTIMONIUM CRUDUM basis. It forms its chest symptoms to a great
extent upon that basis. Many of the symptoms are like ANTIMONIUM
CRUDUM; many symptoms are worse when warmed up, and from too much
clothing. You will see this patient sitting up in bed with no
clothing around the shoulders or neck, and the night-gown wide open
in order to breathe. Suffocates if the room is too warm. It gets
that from the ANT-C. It is worse from bathing in cold water, like
ANT-C. The mucous membranes are covered with thick white mucus,
like ANT-C. Also he does not want to be meddled with or bothered.
Everything is a burden. The child when sick doesn't want to be
touched or talked to or looked at. Wants to be let alone. The
infant is always keeping up a pitiful whining and moaning. Many
times the respiration is a moaning respiration. Rattling and
moaning. Always in bad humor, that is, extremely irritable when
disturbed. Any disturbance seems to increase the breathing and is
an annoyance and makes the patient irritable. No wonder the patient
is wonderfully anxious, because from his appearance we would say
that he must have the feeling that he is dying. He looks as if he
were sinking, and if he does not get relief soon he certainly will
die, for there is a filling up of the chest that is suffocating
him, and the feeling is that of suffocation, dyspnoea, which is
steadily increasing. The wings of the nose move as in LYCOPODIUM.
LYCOPODIUM competes with it very closely and resembles it very
much.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There are many
headaches laid down under Ant-t., but ANT-C. is more likely to work
out for Antimonium headaches, while this medicine is more likely to
work out for Antimonium chest troubles. Both of these remedies have
very decided gastric symptoms. Constant nausea, vomiting and
indigestion. Ant-t. with its difficult breathing is sick at the
stomach. Loathes everything, loathes food; vomits even water. He
has also a docile state and if allowed to be quiet, in spite of all
the sufferings, he will fall into a sleep, or go into a state of
inability to feel. He will cough and sleep, and snore through the
dyspnoea, so that it is in many ways like ANT-C., but ANT-C. has
nothing like the copious flow of mucus from mucous membranes that
are inflamed. It has nothing like the passive state of the whole
economy. It is not so desperate in its provings, and not so
dreadful to look upon.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Clinically Ant-t.
has been confined in its use mostly to the mucous membranes of the
chest, but it has the same passive conditions of all the mucous
membranes of the body, discharges of white mucus from the eyes.
"Eyes prominent, glaring. Dim, and swimming. Gonorrhoeal
ophthalmia." But the rheumatic conditions furnish another form of
this remedy, another phase of it like ANT-C. The joints are
affected, take on a passive, slow infiltration and become
dropsical; dropsical swelling of all the joints. Gouty infiltration
of the joints, and these are especially bad during the cold, wet
weather. Eye symptoms of this gouty character. Eyes infiltrated
along with the joints, so there is a gouty state of the eyes. The
gouty state affects the whole body. The mucous membrane is pale
instead of being red and inflamed; it is pale and relaxed, and it
appears to ooze; mucus forms upon it very readily. This is the
state that occurs in the chest. It is not that burning rawness
found in ARS. and the more acute remedies, although there is a
state of prostration and the anxiety and cold sweat which resembles
ARS.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">TEETH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Then this gouty
state affects the teeth. His teeth are all rheumatic. "Rheumatic
pains in the teeth," with rheumatic pains in the joints. Teeth are
sensitive. "Teeth covered with mucus."</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">STOMACH</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">With all the
complaints the STOMACH gives out, and there is nausea, inability to
digest and loathing of food. Vomiting of everything taken into the
stomach; vomiting of even a spoonful of water. In most complaints
this remedy is THIRSTLESS. It is an exception that it has thirst.
Generally in these attacks of dyspnoea the friends of the patient
stand around with a very strong desire to do something, if it is
only to hand a glass of water. This patient is irritated by being
offered a swallow of water. He is disturbed, and shows his
annoyance. The child will make an offended grunt when offered
water. Thirstlessness with all these bronchial troubles, with
copious discharge of mucus and great rattling in the chest.
Sometimes there is an irresistible desire for cold things in the
stomach, but it is the exception. "Desire for acids or acid
fruits," and they make him sick. Troubles brought on in the stomach
from vinegar, from sour things, from sour wine, from sour fruits,
as in ANT-C. Aversion to milk and every other kind of nourishment,
but milk especially makes the patient sick, causing nausea and
vomiting. The stomach and abdomen are greatly distended with
flatulence. The abdomen is tympanitic. With the stomach symptoms
and bowel symptoms there is this CONSTANT NAUSEA, but it is more
than a nausea, it is a deadly loathing of every kind of food or
nourishment, a nausea with the feeling that if he took anything
into the stomach he would die; not merely aversion to food, not
merely a common nausea that precedes vomiting, but a deadly
loathing of food. The weakness takes on an increased anxiety, and
he increasingly suffocates when he is offered food. Kind-hearted
people very often want him to take something, for perhaps he has
not taken any food all day, or all night; but the thought of food
only increases the dyspnoea, increases his nausea, his loathing and
his suffering. Vomiting is not an easy matter in this remedy. The
vomiting is more or less spasmodic. "Violent retching. Gagging and
retching and straining to vomit. Suffocation, gagging, through
great torture." The stomach seems to take on a convulsive action,
and it is with the greatest difficulty, after many of these great
efforts, that a little comes up, and then a little more, and this
is kept up. "Vomiting of anything that has been put into the
stomach, with quantities of mucus." Thick, white, ropy mucus,
sometimes with blood. "Vomits slime, with great exertion. Vomiting
large quantities of mucus. Vomits tenacious mucus." "Vomiting of
slime, with bile. A tough, watery mucus, then some food, then
bile." But the principal thing vomited is the thick, white, ropy
mucus, flowing from the mucous membranes everywhere. Tough and
stringy; can be drawn out in strings. The patient is often choked
while this thick, ropy, white mucus is expelled from the oesophagus
and mouth. The mouth fills up with it. It is a tremendous effort, a
spasmodic effort, for this patient to rid the stomach of its
contents, which is mucus, or mucus and bile. Early in the vomiting
it is mucus, and after much straining there is a regurgitation of
bile into the stomach, and the continuing of vomiting is from bile.
The great straining also induces a flow of blood into the stomach,
and the contents of the stomach will be streaked with blood.
ULCERATION of mucous membranes everywhere. It has ulcers in the
nose and in the larynx, and ulcers that bleed. Bleeding ulcers in
the stomach, and so there is vomiting of blood.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Like ANT-C., it has
been useful in old drunkards. Old drunkards sometimes take on a
debilitated form and take frequent colds. After getting over a big
debauch, having been many days on one of their times, they become
relaxed and cold, and take cold, and the chest fills up with mucus,
and they are vomiting, suffocating and vomiting. "Rattling of mucus
in the chest of old drunkards." Ant-t. is sometimes required.
ANT-C. when the trouble is confined mostly to the stomach. Ant-t.
when the chest symptoms are present with growing anxiety and the
coldness and the prostration; prostration from long drinking. Old
gouty patients, old drunkards; old broken down constitutions. In
children also that have broken down constitutions, as if they had
grown old. These take cold in the chest, with great rattling of
mucus, and require this remedy.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Very commonly there
is anxiety in the stomach, it is not always described as a pain,
but an anxious feeling, a deathly sinking, an indescribable sinking
in the stomach as if she was going to die. "Anxiety in the stomach,
with nausea." A passive congestion of the liver, with vomiting and
bile.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">ABDOMEN</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The remedy is also
full of cutting pains, cutting like a knife. Pinching in the
intestines. Colicky pains. Distension of the abdomen. The abdomen
may be distended with serum, or it may be distended with flatus.
"Sharp, cutting pains, as with knives. Most violent pains in the
abdomen." Dropsy is one of the natural conditions of all forms of
Antimonium. I remember an energetic horse doctor feeding all the
horses BLACK ANTIMONY when the epizootic was upon the land, going
through all the stables. I learned that he was giving BLACK
ANTIMONY to all horses and I left instructions that mine should not
have any medicine except what I gave. Nearly all the horses that he
treated, ended in dropsy, and were laid up for days and weeks with
the legs wrapped up. It was a proving of Antimonium. Ant-t. is full
of it. It was a common thing, formerly, for old broken down
constitutions to be put on Ant-t, at the end of pneumonia and
fevers, but they almost always had bloating of the feet for three
or four months after getting up. If they did not have that, they
had "fever sores." Antimonium is a common cause of the "fever
sore," the lingering indolent ulcer that forms upon the legs
following old fevers in broken down constitutions. Sometimes they
never get rid of them. They certainly never get rid of them unless
they fall into the hands of a prescriber of our school.</span></p>
