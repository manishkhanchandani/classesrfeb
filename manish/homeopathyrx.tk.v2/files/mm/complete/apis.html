<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">APIS
MELLIFICA</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Apis)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This remedy has so
many symptoms on the surface of the body we will study the outer
aspect first. All over the body is found a thick rash, sometimes of
a rose color. It is rough and can be felt as a rough rash under the
fingers. The patient at this time is greatly distressed by heat and
the skin is sensitive to touch with the rash or without it. Nodular
swellings here and there come and go. Then comes an erysipelatous
inflammatory condition, in patches, here and there, about the head,
with great tumefaction about the face, eyes and eyelids. Erysipelas
may occur anywhere, but it more commonly belongs to the face and
runs to a high degree of inflammatory action, with stinging,
burning and oedema. In the extremities we have a marked dropsy,
swelling with pitting upon pressure. A general anasarca may appear.
The face is greatly swollen at times, the eyelids look like water
bags, the uvula hangs down like a water bag, the abdominal walls
are of great thickness and pit upon pressure, and the mucous
membranes in any part look as if they would discharge water if they
were punctured. Puffing or oedema, with pitting upon pressure, is a
general condition that may be present in any inflammatory state.
There is a general amelioration from cold and aggravation from
heat. The skin symptoms and the patient are aggravated from heat.
This prevails also in the mental state, in inflammatory conditions;
in cardiac conditions, in dropsy, in sore throat, etc. Sometimes
this aggravation amounts to aggravation from warm drinks, warm
room, warm clothing, warmth of the fire, etc.; if it is heat the
patient is greatly disturbed. In brain troubles, if you put an Apis
patient with congestion of the brain into a warm bath he will go
into convulsions, and consequently warm bathing is not always "good
for fits." It is taught in old school text-books so much that the
old women and nurses know that a hot bath is good for fits, and
before you get there just as like as not you will have a dead baby.
This congestion of the brain, with little twitchings and
threatening convulsions, makes them put the baby in a hot bath, and
it is in an awful state when you get there. If the baby needs OPIUM
or Apis in congestion of the brain the fits become worse by bathing
in hot water. If the nurse has been doing that kind of business you
have learned the remedy as soon as you enter the house, for she
will say the child has been worse ever since the warm bath, has
become pale as a ghost and she was afraid he was going to die.
There you have convulsions worse from heat, pointing especially to
OPIUM and Apis. That is the way with Apis all through. It is not
laid down in the books that Apis is worse in the throat symptoms
from warm drinks and wants altogether cold things, and will not
take warm things which aggravate, but one of our graduates wrote me
that by making use simply of the generals, as he had been
instructed, Apis conforming to all the rest of the case, he made a
beautiful cure of a case of diphtheria which had the relief from
cold, which shows how generals are continued into particulars and
how they can be made use of. The generals continue to build and
enlarge our Materia Medica.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Upon the outer
surface then we see that Apis is full of dropsy, red rash,
eruptions, urticaria, erysipelas, which inflammations extend to the
mucous membranes. The outer part of man is his skin and mucous
membrane. When we are dealing with man from centre to
circumference, we think of the innermost as the brain and heart and
internal organs that are vital, while their coatings and coverings
are external. Apis affects the things that are external; it affects
the envelopes, the coverings. You notice how frequently it affects
the skin and the tissues near the skin, and it also affects the
envelopes or coverings of organs; for example, the pericardium. It
establishes serous inflammations with effusion. Apis produces an
inflammation of the membranes of the brain. In the serous sac which
encloses the heart, pericardium, and also in the peritoneum it
produces the same kind of inflammation. Thus we see that the
coverings are especially affected by Apis, viz., the skin and
mucous membranes and the coverings of organs; and with these we get
dropsy, catarrh and erysipelas. In all of these inflammatory
conditions there is stinging and burning; burning like coals of
fire at times, and stinging as if needles or small splinters were
sticking in.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The MENTAL SYMPTOMS
of Apis are very striking, and the most striking thing throughout
the mental state is the aggravation from heat and from a warm room.
The symptoms themselves are great sadness, constant tearfulness
without any cause, weeping night and day; cannot sleep from
tantalizing thoughts and worrying about everything. Depression of
spirits with constant weeping. Sadness and melancholy; extreme
irritability; borrowing trouble about everything. Foolishly
suspicious and jealous. Absolutely joyless. Absolutely indifferent
to everything that would make her happy or joyful. No ability to
apply things that would make her happy to herself, they must mean
someone else. Foolish, silly, childish behavior in a woman in
confinement, in a woman in advanced years; talking foolish twaddle,
such as a child would talk, on serious occasions. Another aspect of
the mental state is the delirium, which comes on in serious forms
of brain affections in children. The child gradually goes into a
state of unconsciousness. Lies in a stupor, one side of the body
twitching, the other side motionless, rolling head from side to
side; head drawn back rigidly; pupils contracted or dilated, eyes
very red, face flushed, a stupid state or state of
semi-consciousness. Child lying with the eyes partly closed, as if
benumbed. It is suitable in congestion of the brain, meningitis or
cerebro-spinal meningitis with opisthotonos when all the symptoms
are aggravated from heat. The child puts on a more dreadful state
if the room becomes overheated; becomes extremely death-like or
pale if the room becomes overheated. If the child is able to do so
it kicks the covers off. If it is in a position where it can look
into a large open grate it will be much aggravated. I have seen
Apis children who had to be removed from near an open fire. They
will cry to get away from the heat that comes upon them from the
register or open fire. The heat increases every symptom, and
sometimes causes them to break out in a cold sweat all over the
body, which does not ameliorate their fever nor the burning heat.
Very often the head is rolling and tossing, the teeth gnashing, and
the eyes flashing with threatening convulsions, the child carrying
the hand to the head at times, a state of semi-consciousness, and
the child screams out with that peculiar scream which is known to
mean congestion of the brain, encephalique- the brain cry. The
shriek is a very strong Apis feature. The child cries out with this
shriek in sleep when going into brain troubles. It says in the
text: "Sopor interrupted by piercing shrieks." We must be able to
see in the general beginning of provings the disease which they
resemble, for we do not always see the remedy in the advanced
state. We see the disease in a state of progress, and must be able
to see it in its beginning. As was the disease in the beginning so
was the remedy in the beginning. Things that have similar
beginnings may have similar endings.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Apis also has
muttering, delirium and loquacity. All kinds of screaming and
shrieking, shrill and otherwise, violent and less violent.
Premonition of death, dread of death, fear of apoplexy. "Very busy,
restless, changing kind of work, with awkwardness." Awkwardness is
especially found under the fingers, toes and limbs in Apis. The
whole nervous system shows a disturbance in co-ordination. This
disturbance in co-ordination runs through the remedy, awkwardness,
staggering with the eyes shut. Dizziness when the eyes are shut.
"Ailments from fright, rage, vexation, jealousy or hearing bad
news." "After severe mental shock paralyzed on the whole right
side."</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The complaints of
Apis are attended with violence and rapidity. They come on with
great rapidity, rush on with violence, until unconsciousness is
reached. It has been my fortune to see many violent cases of
poisoning from the sting of the honey-bee. When the oversensitive
patient is poisoned by the sting he is dreadfully sick. The
majority of people in the course of their life have been stung by
the honey-bee and a mere little swelling occurs in the region of
the sting, a swelling as big as a robin's egg or a hen's egg at
most, without constitutional states; that is, when the individual
is not sensitive to Apis. He may have been stung in half a dozen
places, and each one gives him a little lump. But you meet one who
is sensitive to the sting of the honey-bee, and if he gets one
little sting on any place in his body, he comes down with nausea
and anxiety that makes him feel that he is dying, and in about ten
minutes he is covered with urticaria from head to foot; he stings
and burns and wants to be bathed in cold water; he fears that he
will die if something is not done to mitigate his suffering, rolls
and tosses as if he would tear himself to pieces. I have seen all
these symptoms come on after Apis. The antidote for that is
CARBOLIC ACID. I have seen CARBOLIC ACID administered in that
state, and the patient described the sensation of the CARBOLIC ACID
going down his throat as a cooling comfort. He says "Why, doctor, I
can feel that dose go to the ends of my fingers." When you
administer an antidote under such circumstances listen to what your
patient says. When you get the true natural antidote, and, at
times, when you get the true curative medicine in a case, no matter
how high the potency is, the patient will say: "I feel that to the
roots of my hair and to the ends of my toes." Such is the feeling
it gives when the true antidotal medicine goes to the innermost
portions of his economy, and that is the way we want to get our
medicines always, to be guided by the symptoms of our patient that
they will tell us what medicines to administer, and when the
medicine is administered its highest reaction is of that
sort.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">If we are well
acquainted with the symptoms of Apis we can many times get along
without having a specialist to treat the eyes. They make more
people blind with their lotions, caustic solutions, etc., than they
benefit. The old-fashioned way was to cauterize with copper and
silver nitrate solution, and the modern things are not much better.
At the present day the homeopathic physician who is not capable of
taking eye symptoms as well as lung symptoms and symptoms of any
part of the body is not competent to practice medicine. Eye cases
can be prescribed for by the physician. In Homeopathy there is no
such thing as treating the eye and other organs of the body, but
the patient with all his organs, not the patient with one or two
organs.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Apis is a great
remedy for the eyes. It has deep-seated inflammatory complaints of
the eyes as a result of disease. Inflammations that are
erysipelatous in character, that leave thickening of the mucous
membrane and lids, and white spots over the eye; opacities.
Inflammation with opacities very extensive or in patches. Enlarged
bloodvessels. When the inflammatory condition is active it is
attended with oedema of the lids, both upper and lower, and the
whole face is sometimes in a state of oedema, such as you would
expect to see after a bee sting. The swelling of the mucous
membranes of the lids is so enormous that they roll out, looking
like pieces of raw beef. The fluid will run out over the cheeks in
great abundance. Burning and stinging like fire, better from
washing, from cold applications, worse from heat. Chronic eye
troubles that are worse from looking into an open fire, worse from
radiated heat; wants something cold applied. Chronic granular lids.
The results of chronic inflammation are numerous and extensive.
Worse from looking at white things, worse from looking at the snow.
Pain in the eyeballs, pain deep in the eyeballs, stitches, burning,
stinging and shooting. Chemosis. Apis is often suitable for old
scrofulous affections of the eyes. Vascular, affections, the veins
are enlarged. "Iritis." "Congestion to the eyes, blood-vessels
injected;" whole conjunctiva inflamed. Photophobia. Rheumatic
ophthalmia, that is, a high grade of inflammation of the eyes in
rheumatic subjects. Catarrhal inflammation of the eyes; scrofulous
inflammation of the eyes. Hot tears gush out of the eyes; burning
in the eyes. Erysipelas of the eyes and sides of the face,
EXTENDING FROM THE RIGHT TO THE LEFT.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This direction is an
Apis feature in many other respects. Erysipelas commences on the
right side of the face, extends over the nose to the left side.
Inflammation commences in the right side of the abdominal viscera
and extends over to the left. In inflammation of the ovary the
right is preferred to the left. The right side of the uterus is
preferred. Pains in the whole right side of the pelvis extending
over towards the left. Burning stinging here and there extending
from right to left.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EAR</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Inflammation of the
middle ear in connection with or after scarlet fever.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">THROAT-MOUTH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Now we come to the
throat troubles of Apis. We have much throat trouble. Apis cures
diphtheria, especially when there is a high grade of inflammation
and the membrane is scanty or comes slowly or insidiously, and it
is somewhat of a surprise the gradual progress it makes; the parts
are oedematous and the soft palate is puffed like a water-bag, and
the uvula hangs down with a semi-transparent appearance like a bag
of water. All around the throat and mouth there is an oedematous
condition looking as if it would flow water if pricked. Burning,
stinging pains in the throat ameliorated by cold and aggravated by
heat. Aversion to all warm substances and drinks. The tongue swells
until it fills the mouth, worse on the right half of the tongue, or
involving the right side first. Raw beef appearance, denuded
appearance of the tongue and buccal cavity and throat. Various
kinds of swelling in the throat; benign swellings, with burning,
stinging and redness. Ulcers in the throat that come as a result of
this inflammation. Apis is suitable in the severest forms of sore
throat accompanying scarlet fever. It cures scarlet fever when the
symptoms agree, and it is not an uncommon thing for Apis to be
suited to scarlet fever, though the rash is sometimes rough. The
scarlet fever rash is not always smooth and shiny. When the rash
does not come out at all, the face is very pallid, with a high
grade of inflammation of the throat; the scarlet fever is in the
family, and the skin is red without any rash; in those cases that
are worse from heat, want the covers off, and are sensitive to the
heat of the room. The patient desires a low temperature in the
room, is worse from heat, wants cool things, worse from radiated
heat especially, or hot air that comes from a register or fire. He
suffocates when a little warm air is radiating over the body. He is
disturbed from heat even in the chill of an intermittent fever; if
in a warm room when having a chill, he suffocates. So it is with
the scarlet fever, with the sore throat, and in diphtheria; from
the least whiff of radiated heat he suffocates. He wants the doors
and windows open, wants something cold. Sometimes the scarlet fever
patient will go into convulsions because the rash fails to come
out. Apis is sometimes a suitable remedy and must be compared with
CUPRUM, ZINCUM and BRYONIA. A warm bath will intensify the
convulsion.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Sensation of
constriction and erosion in the throat in the morning." Throat sore
and swollen; stinging pains. "Could not swallow solid food." With
these complaints there is often shivering, shuddering, little
chills intermingled with the febrile state. Many times you will
think to comfort him by covering him up with a warm blanket, but it
will make him worse, he will throw it off. A child will kick off
the covers. An adult who is shivering while covered up will kick
off the covers. These strange and peculiar things are guiding
features, things that cannot be accounted for.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOMACH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In Apis there is
vomiting, nausea, retching and vomiting, with great anxiety.
Vomiting of bile and everything eaten. Vomiting of bitter and sour
fluids.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">ABDOMEN</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Apis causes soreness
and tightness throughout the abdomen and hypochondria. Sensation of
tightness runs through many of the complaints of Apis. The abdomen
is distended with gas. Meteoritic condition, great tension and
fulness, hard and drum-like. In all inflammatory complaints, in
peritonitis, inflammation of the liver, inflammation of the pelvis,
there is great tension, tightness; but this tightness is not always
general, sometimes it is local; sometimes it is with little
congestion, but tightness prevails throughout the abdomen, and this
tightness makes it impossible for the patient to cough for fear
something will burst. The cough makes him feel as if something
would be torn. Cannot strain at stool. This is common in the
abdominal and pelvic complaints of women. The woman will say she
cannot strain at stool, because of the feeling that if she strains
something will break loose. The same state exists in the chest. It
seems that on coughing something will tear loose, as if the fibres
are in a state of tension or stretching.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Hypersensitive state
of the liver; inflammation of the liver and spleen. Pain under the
short ribs, worse on the left side. "Pains from below the ribs
spreading upward. Obliged to bend forward from a painful contracted
feeling in the hypochondria." All the complaints are likely to make
the patient bend forward and flex the limbs, because the state of
tension is painful. Sensitiveness of the stomach to touch. Over the
whole abdomen she is so sore that touch is extremely painful; in
all the inflammatory complaints of women the abdomen is very sore
and painful. Soreness, distension and stinging burning pains
through the abdomen. Burning heat in the stomach.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the external
abdomen there is an oedematous state. Dropsy, sometimes alone,
sometimes with anasarca. Limbs swollen to the full extent, pitting
upon pressure, the feet and limbs swollen, with burning, stinging
and numbness in the limbs.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOOL</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Feeling as if the
intestines were bruised. Watery diarrhoea is common in Apis; yellow
stools, green stools, olive green stools, watery stools, etc. Every
day six to eight diarrhoeic stools, which smell like carrion. It is
especially useful in a peculiar kind of stool occurring in children
and infants, an intermingling of blood, mucus and food, giving the
stool an appearance like tomato sauce. The anus protrudes with
stool and seems to remain open, an open anus like PHOS. and PULS.
Chronic diarrhoea, dysentery, haemorrhagia from the bowels. In its
constipation it is related more commonly to head troubles. He goes
many days without a stool. The bowels seem to be perfectly
paralyzed, with congestion of the brain and acute
hydrocephalus.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">URETHRA-URINE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The urinary troubles
are numerous in Apis. The urine is scanty, coming only in drops.
Much straining before the urine will start, and then only a few
drops; dribbling a little hot urine, burning urine, bloody urine.
As soon as a few drops collect in the bladder the urging comes,
constant, ineffectual urging. Later the urine is almost suppressed.
Infants go a long time without passing urine, screeching and
carrying the hand to the head, crying out in sleep, kicking off the
covers. Very often a dose of Apis will be found useful. It is often
called for in scarlet fever when the urine is loaded with albumen.
Urinary troubles, with swelling of the genitals, and the swelling
is oedematous. Scanty urine in little boys, with the foreskin
enormously distended, or in hydrocele. Every time the call to
urinate comes he will shriek, because he remembers the pain he had
the last time. Inflammatory complaints of the kidneys and ureters,
bladder and urethra. The whole urinary tract is irritated, very
much like CANTHARIS, and these two medicines antidote each other.
If you are called to a child that has been drugged with crude Apis
you can generally antidote it with CANTHARIS. If you go to a woman
who has taken CANTHARIS for vicious purposes, you can very often
overcome it with Apis. The violent frenzy that has been brought on
by CANTHARIS will be overcome by Apis. The smarting, burning and
stinging along the urinary tract will be found under Apis. "Flow of
urine unconscious." Stitching pain in the urethra with enuresis.
Morbid irritability of the urinary organs. "Strangury. Agony in
voiding urine. Retention of urine in nursing infants." It is queer
how the old women knew, long before Apis was proved, that when the
little new-born baby did not pass its water they could find a cure
by going out to the bee-hive and catching a few bees, over which
they poured hot water, arid of which they gave the baby a
teaspoonful. Some domestic things like that have been known among
families and among nurses, and it is consistent because it is just
like what we give Apis for. "Urine scanty and foetid, containing
albumen and blood corpuscles." Especially in acute albuminuria. The
acute inflammatory affection of the kidney with albuminuria, such
as occurs in scarlet fever or diphtheria, or after these, such as
occurs as a sequel of acute disease. Inflammation of the kidney
closes up the case and kills off a good many in allopathic hands,
never in homeopathic hands.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-FEMALE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It is closely
related to the genital organs of both male and female. Swelling and
oedematous state of the genitals. Apis is a great friend of the
woman. It cures all of her inflammatory complaints it seems, when
the symptoms agree. That is to say, it produces inflammation of the
uterus and ovaries and dreadful sufferings in the external and
internal parts, and we have only to discover when the symptoms
agree to cure most of these inflammatory troubles. It even stops
abortion. It will stop abortion after some miserable scoundrel has
attempted to get rid of the offspring, and she has taken drugs and
brought on pains, pains strong enough to expel the contents of the
uterus, especially in the first, second and third months. A little
haemorrhagia has come on, a mere threatening, the membranes are not
yet ruptured, but they soon will be, and she has stinging, burning
pains, and lies uncovered and suffers from the heat, probably from
the overdose of ERGOT. Apis will overcome this greatly to her
regret. This kind of villainy prevails. But women have accidents
and weakness, whereby, in spite of the fact that they desire to
hold their offspring, they are threatened with abortion, and Apis
is a great friend to the prospective mother. Burning and stinging
pains in the ovaries, especially the right; when greatly enlarged
and even cystic, Apis has proved a curative remedy, has often cured
tumors, and has caused cystic formations to stop growing or to
disappear. The right ovarian region is very sensitive. Pain in the
uterus and ovaries before and during menstruation. Stinging,
rending, tearing pains cutting like knives, worse from heat. It is
a very easily got symptom, because in most painful symptoms heat or
the hot water bag are tried with the natural hope of relief, but
with this remedy it aggravates. She throws it aside, for the pain
is worse from heat. "Ovaries enlarged," etc. Dropsy of right ovary.
Ovarian tumor.</span></p>
