<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="cs243F98C">ARGENTUM
NITRICUM</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Arg-n.)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">MENTAL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">We shall find by
examining the symptoms of this remedy that the intellectual feature
predominates, as in the metal; that the affections are disturbed
only in a limited way. There is a predominance of mental symptoms.
First of all, disturbance in the memory, disturbance of reason; he
becomes most irrational in his explanations of his actions and
methods. He is irrational and does strange things and comes to
strange conclusions; does foolish things. He has all sorts of
imaginations, illusions, hallucinations. He is tormented in his
mind by the inflowing of troublesome thoughts, and especially at
night his thoughts torment him to the extent that he is extremely
anxious, and this puts him in a hurry and in a fidget, and he goes
out and walks and walks, and the faster he walks the faster he
thinks he must walk, and he walks till fatigued. Strange notions
and ideas and fears come into his mind. He has an impulse that he
is going to have a fit or that he is going to have a sickness. A
strange thought comes into his mind that if he goes past a certain
corner of the street he will create a sensation, will fall down and
have a fit, and to avoid that he will go around the block, he
avoids going past that corner for fear he will do something
strange. He is so reduced in his mental state that he admits into
the mind all sorts of impulses. There is inflowing of strange
thoughts into his mind, and when crossing a bridge or high place
the thought that he might kill himself, or perhaps he might jump
off, or what if he should jump off, and sometimes the actual
impulse comes to jump off the bridge into the water. When looking
out of a window the thought comes to his mind what an awful thing
it would be to jump out of the window, and sometimes the impulse
comes to actually jump out of the window There is fear of death,
the over-anxious state, that death is near, and often at times like
ACON. he predicts the moment he is going to die. Looking forward to
times he is anxious. When looking forward to something that he is
about to do, or that he has promised to do, or in the expectation
of things, he is anxious. When about to meet an engagement he is
anxious until the time comes. If he is about to take a railroad
journey he is anxious, full of fear and anxiety and tremulous
nervousness until he is on the car going and then it passes away.
If he is about to meet a certain person on the street corner he is
anxious and breaks out often in a sweat from anxiety until it is
over with. Not only is this particular symptom present, but the
symptoms come on as a result of his anxiety. He is excitable,
angers easily, and as a result of this, pain comes. When he becomes
angry, he becomes vehement and pain in the head comes on; cough,
pain in the chest and weakness follow this anger. The anxiety he
has from these circumstances will bring on complaints. When he is
going anywhere, going to a wedding, or to the opera, or any unusual
event, it is attended with anxiety, fear and diarrhoea. So it is we
have in this a wonderful medicine. It says in the text that he gave
all sorts of queer reasons for his strange conduct, endeavouring to
cover up, as it were, his foolishness which he himself realizes.
Sadness, melancholy and confusion. Defective memory.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">PHYSICAL</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The sight of high
houses makes him dizzy, and his vertigo is increased or comes on
from closing the eyes; with the vertigo there is buzzing in the
ears, great weakness and trembling.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Constitutional
headaches from brain-fag, from exertion of the mind. In such mental
exhaustion, headaches, nervous excitement and trembling, and
organic troubles of the heart and liver in business men, in
students, in brain workers, in those subject to long excitement, in
actors who have kept up a long time the excitement of appearing
well in public. This state of mind progresses until there is a
general state of weakness; with trembling, paralysis, numbness,
disturbed functions, palpitation, throbbing all over the body, with
the mental state. The nervous state continues until there is
disorder of all the organs of the body. The stomach refuses to
digest, everything taken seems to go into gas, and he becomes
distended and suffers with pain. The circulation seems to be
greatly disturbed in addition to the palpitation. Fullness of the
blood vessels and throbbing all over the body. The blood vessels
become diseased. Atheromatous degeneration and dilatation of the
veins, varicose veins. Upon the mucous membranes and skin
ulceration, and this progresses and the heart becomes increasingly
feeble, and the extremities become cold and blue and the lips are
cold and blue, with aggravation of all these complaints from mental
excitement, from going to the opera, from meeting a friend, from
keeping an engagement. The medicine is pre-eminently a nervous one,
full of spinal symptoms, rending, tearing pains down the
extremities; such pains are found in locomotor ataxia, fulgurating,
shooting pains. There is one grand feature running through this
patient modifying most of his symptoms, with few exceptions, and
that is that he is like a PULS. patient; he wants cold air, cold
drinks, cold things; he wants ice, ice cream; wants the head in the
cold air; suffocates in a warm room. He suffocates from warm
clothing, wants the door and windows open; cannot breathe in a
stuffy room, suffocates if other people are in the room; cannot go
to church or to the opera, cannot go to places of amusement or
gatherings, must stay at home. He dreads a crowd, dreads certain
places.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Everywhere we find
ulceration, but particularly upon the mucous membrane. The throat
has ulcers in it; ulceration of the eyelids, and of the cornea;
ulceration of the bladder. Ulcers of the uterus, of the vagina and
of the external soft parts. This tendency to ulcerate seems rather
strange, peculiar that it should have in its pathogenesis such a
tendency, when the old school has been using it to cauterize
ulcers, and yet it heals them up. We know that PHOS. will burn and
it intensifies the tendency to ulcerate, makes the ulcer go deeper,
while Argentum nitricum sets it healing. Upon mucous membranes we
find red elevations, granulations, enlargement of vessels, purplish
aspect. Sensitive ulcers. The complaints in women come on BEFORE
and DURING the menstrual period. It is a favourable time for all
her complaints to be aggravated; if she has Argentum nitricum
symptoms they are likely to be at their worst at this time. She
suffers from most violent dysmenorrhoea, from nervous excitement,
from hysterical manifestations, and an unusually increased flow. A
tendency to haemorrhagia belongs to this remedy. The ulcers bleed;
there is bleeding from the nose, bleeding from the chest, the urine
is bloody; leucorrhoea copious, menstrual flow copious;
menorrhagia; bleeding from the mucous membranes generally, from the
uterus. Vomiting of blood. It has cured prolonged and most
inveterate ulceration of the stomach, when there has been vomiting
of blood.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The aggravation at
the menstrual period is a strong feature and she is free from
symptoms during the interim. The palpitation, the trembling, the
coldness of the surface, though desiring cold open air, blueness of
the lips, coldness of the extremities, blueness and coldness of the
lower extremities to the knees and of the hands and arms to the
elbows, and yet the patient wants cool things, wants something
cold. This may not be seen at any other time. Here is a striking
feature. "Patient cannot lie on the RIGHT side because it brings on
so much palpitation." We have plenty of remedies with palpitation
worse from lying on left side, but remedies with palpitation worse
lying on the right side are rare (ALUMN., BAD., KALM., KALI-N.,
LIL-T., PLAT., SPONG.). It is uncommon, strange, rare and peculiar.
It is such a strong feature in this remedy that to a great extent
it becomes quite general, because it is a HEART symptom and is
intermingled with the general symptoms. With this sensitiveness he
is compelled to get into some other position; must get up and walk,
because of lying on the right side. The patient will say he throbs
from head to foot while lying on the right side; he throbs all
over, a general pulsation when lying on the right side. Do not
forget in this medicine all these general things when we come to
apply them in their particulars and the particulars in the
generals. Do not forget that this medicine is one of the most
FLATULENT medicines in the books. He is distended to bursting; gets
scarcely any relief from passing flatus or eructations.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">He is possessed with
the distressing idea that all his undertakings must fail. When
walking he becomes faint with anxiety which makes him walk faster.
Everywhere you will find the intellectual symptoms
predominant.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD-VERTIGO</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The headaches are of
a congestive character; considerable throbbing, ameliorated by
cold, and tight bandaging. Headache from mental exertion, from
excitement, with vertigo, nausea and vomiting. Pains in the right
side of the head, jagging, cutting, stitching, pulsating. Head
feels much enlarged.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE-VISION</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The eye symptoms are
too numerous to mention. They are of a general character such as we
find in catarrhal conditions with ulceration, relieved by cold. All
of the eye symptoms are worse in a warm room, worse from sitting by
the fire. Wants cold applications, cold washing. Intense
photophobia; aversion to light, and this is worse in a warm room;
wants it cold, wants it dark. There is much swelling and
tumefaction of the blood vessels of the eye, and redness, and it
has a raw denuded excoriated appearance. "Chemosis with
strangulated vessels." "Cornea opaque." "Ulceration of cornea in
new-born infants; profuse purulent discharge from the lids," and
this is what the "Regulars" in former days and almost up to date
have been using for the eyes, treating them with Argentum nitricum.
Photophobia: after long looking at fine sewing, fine print. In one
who has suddenly taken on far sightedness, it has come on as a
congestive condition; not of old age but something that should be
cured. All at once he cannot see print at the usual distance but
must hold it away off; if it occurs in some one twenty-five years
of age or in a child. At close distance it is indistinguishable.
Such a disturbance of accommodation producing far sightedness it
has caused and cured. "Oedema of lids," etc.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Oedema is a word
which runs through the remedy. That is to say, it has a dropsical
state wherever dropsy may occur.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">FACE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The face is the next
place we find particulars worthy of note. "Face: sweat stood in
drops on his face." "Face sunken, pale, bluish." "Looks prematurely
old." "Face blue, heavy breathing, pulse less."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">THROAT</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Then come the throat
symptoms. Another feature of this remedy is its general tendency to
produce warts. There is a tendency to favour the growth of warts
and in the throat there are little wart-like growths; polypoid
growths in the throat and about the genitals and anus; hence its
great use in sycotic constitutions. It has all the discharge
necessary to its use in the sycotic constitution.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Felt as if he had a
stick in the throat when swallowing." At once you will see its
close relation to HEP. In inflammatory conditions of the throat
with ulceration. In Argentum nitricum he wants to be in a cold
room, wants cold air, and to swallow cold things. In HEP. he wants
warm things to drink, warm clothing, warm room, and cannot put even
his hand out of bed or his throat will begin paining him. Things,
you see, just exactly opposite, but they both have "sticks" in the
throat. In dry chronic catarrh ALUM. and NAT-M. have "sticks" in
the throat; but in red throat with tumefaction and pain these two
remedies give no relief, the former two are better. "Sticks" in the
throat like fish-bones. NIT-AC., HEP. and Argentum nitricum are the
most striking remedies for the fish-bone sensation. Many remedies
have sticking in the throat, but these are the most prominent. We
know how Argentum nitricum has been used for ulceration in the
throat, and here it comes in as one of the most useful remedies in
congestion of the throat of long standing. Catarrhs with loss of
voice. Warty growths, condylomata, etc. Loss of voice, tumefaction
of the mucous membrane round about the vocal cords and paresis of
the vocal cords. Condylomata on the vocal cords.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOMACH-ABDOMEN-STOOL-RECTUM</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Loss of appetite"
and refuses drink. This is another feature. DESIRES SUGAR. He feels
that he must have it and it makes him sick, brings on eructations,
increased flatulence, sour stomach. He cannot digest it; it acts
like a physic and brings on a diarrhoea. So marked is the
aggravation from sugar that the nursing infant will get a green
diarrhoea if the mother eats candy. Then is it astonishing that the
baby can get a dynamized dose from the mother, when the dynamized
dose can travel like lightning, and sugar takes all day to be
digested and dynamized and fed as poison to the baby ? I remember a
case that I figured and figured on. The baby had MERCURIAL stools,
sure enough, they were grass green. Well CHAM. has grass green
stools and ARS. and MERC. and lots of remedies have grass green
stools. Routinist that I was in those days I could not get anything
but MERC. out of it, and although the baby had gotten MERC., ARS.
and CHAM. there was no relief, until I found that the mother had
been eating candy. When she was asked if she ate sweet things,
sugar, etc., she said, "Oh, no." "Why, yes, you do," said the
husband; "I bring you home a pound of candy every day. What do you
do with it?" "Oh, that was nothing," she replied. But the baby did
not get well until it got Argentum nitricum and the mother stopped
eating sugar. "IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE FOR SUGAR." Quite a number of
medicines have craving for sweets, but many of them can eat sweets
with impunity. It is always a peculiar thing when one of the
articles of diet, such as milk, sugar, salt, starch, etc., and the
things of the table make sick. When it is said that "I cannot eat a
teaspoonful of anything with starch, egg or sugar in it without
being sick," it is always strange and peculiar, because it is not
something that comes in only as a craving and affecting the
stomach, but it affects the whole patient. The patient says: "I
become sick," and hence it becomes a general. When the patient gets
&nbsp;diarrhoea from eating sugar it is not merely a local and
particular symptom, because the whole patient is sick before the
diarrhoea begins; the diarrhoea is the outcome. Hence as it is a
general it is necessary that it should be examined into.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"The vomited
substances tinge the bedding black." Incessant vomiting of food. He
sometimes spits up food by the mouthful until the stomach is empty.
Eructations of air accompanied by a mouthful of undigested food,
like PHOS. and FERR. Spitting it up; welling up in
mouthfuls.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Eructations
relieve." "Flatulence passes upwards, in quantities." Frequent
eructations. Eructations do not always relieve. It is more like
CHIN. in its eructations. The eructations of CARB-V. relieve for
some time and he feels better. This is the way with CARB- V.; he is
distended almost to bursting and he cannot get up any wind, but
finally after much pain and distension it wells up in empty
eructations and then he gets relief. With CHIN. he is distended,
and every little while getting up gas, but with no relief. It does
not seem to help, and sometimes patients will say they seem to get
worse after it. So it is with Argentum nitricum at times. It
evidently has both. "Most gastric ailments are accompanied by
belching." "Belching difficult; finally air rushes out with great
violence." "Nausea after every meal; nausea with troublesome
efforts to vomit." I have seen these Argentum nitricum patients
vomiting and purging in the same moment, not vomiting one second
and purging the next, but gushing out both ways with great
exhaustion like cholera morbus, so relaxed, prostrated and weak.
"Vomit; streaked brown, flocculent, like coffee
grounds."</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The stomach, liver
and abdomen are full of pain. The abdomen distended with all this
troublesome flatulence. Inflammation of the stomach, ulceration of
the stomach, most troublesome diarrhoea. Diarrhoea with copious
flatus. Stool with copious flatus in nursing children, with tormina
and viscous sanguinolent stools and tenesmus. "Diarrhoea of
children after weaning." Another feature in connection with the
diarrhoea and dysentery is that casts are passed with the stool,
like diphtheritic membrane or deposit; casts like the rectum,
strings of membrane, come with the stool. Stools of green, foetid
mucus with noisy flatus at night.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">URETHRA-URINE-GENITALIA</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Urine passed
unconsciously and uninterruptedly." "Urging to urinate; the urine
passes less easily and freely". "Bleeding of the urethra; painful
erections; gonorrhoea." It has most painful gonorrhoea with painful
erections in the male. In the female the vagina is extremely sore,
and the external soft parts are swollen; tumefaction. Vagina feels
sore on urinating; bloody discharge. In the male, orchitis from
suppressed discharge.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-FEMALE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the female,
ovaritis, inflammation of all the pelvic organs. Great soreness all
over the pelvis. Bleeding from the vagina. Ulceration of the
uterus. Coition is painful or impossible. "Pains like sticks or
slivers in and about the womb," etc. This sensation prevails
wherever there are ulcers. "Prolapsus with ulceration of the os or
cervix." Haemorrhagia of short duration; shooting pains through
abdomen and stomach. Metrorrhagia. Complaints of nervous women and
at the menstrual period. Menses suppressed or scanty. Complaints
during pregnancy.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">CHEST</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Under the symptoms
of the heart and pulse: "Anxiety with palpitation and throbbing
through the whole body." "Violent palpitation from the slightest
mental emotion or sudden muscular exertion. Palpitation obliges her
to press hand hard against heart for relief. Heart's action
irregular, intermittent," etc.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">BACK</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Pain in the lumbar
region comes on while sitting, but is better when standing and
walking. Pain in the back from flatulence. Sore pain in the spine.
Pain in back at night. Great weight in the lumbar region. It is a
very useful remedy in locomotor ataxia.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EXTREMITIES</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Great restlessness.
The nervous symptoms are very numerous. Periodical trembling of the
body. Chorea, with tearing in the legs. Convulsions preceded by
great restlessness. Nervous, faintish, tremulous sensation,
etc.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">SLEEP</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The sleep symptoms
are quite general. Distressing nightmares. The dreams are horrible.
Wakens in excitement and with starting. All sorts of strange,
horrible things in sleep. Dreams of vicious and violent things, and
that everything is going to happen to him. Dreams of departed
friends, etc.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">On waking in the
morning limbs feel bruised; aching in the chest, etc. Cannot sleep
at night because he is so nervous.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Erysipelatous bed
sores. While riding, palpitation and anxiety compelling him to get
out of the wagon and walk, and that real fast.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">SKIN</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Purplish rash, such
as appears in the most serious forms of scarlet fever and zymotic
diseases.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Its most natural
antidote is NATRUM MURIATICUM. When you have the ulceration, where
the throat has been cauterized or the cervix uteri or eyelids have
been cauterized by Nitrate of Silver study NAT-M. and see if the
symptoms of the case would not justify its administration. It is
the most common natural antidote for these vicious
practices.</span></p>
