<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">ARNICA
MONTANA</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Arn.)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Arnica patient
is morose, wants to be let alone, does not want to be talked to,
does not want to be approached. He does not want to be approached,
both because he does not wish to enter into conversation, a mental
state, and also because he does not wish to be touched on account
of the great bodily soreness. These are the two most striking
things in this medicine. Irritable, morose, sad, fearful, easily
frightened, imagines all sorts of things, especially that he has
heart disease, or that he will mortify, or that some deep-seated
trouble is upon him. Full of nightmare, dreadful dreams, dreams of
muddy water, robbers, etc. Horrors in the night. He frequently
rouses up in the night, grasps at the heart, has the appearance of
great horror, and fears some dreadful thing will happen. A sudden
fear of death comes on at this time, rousing him up in the night;
he grasps at the heart, and thinks he is going to die suddenly. He
is full of dreadful anguish, but finally he comes to himself, lies
down, goes off into a sleep of terror, jumps up again with the fear
of sudden death, and says: "Send for a doctor at once." This is
repeated night after night in persons who are fairly well in the
daytime, who have no sympathy because there seems to be no reality
in their sickness, only a mental state. It is also seen in persons
who have gone through a railroad accident, or through some shock,
who are sore and bruised from injury. They rouse up in the night
with a fear of sudden death, with an expression of terror; the
horrors they really went through are repeated. This is similar to
OPIUM, only the OPIUM fear remains, even in the daytime. Arnica
dreams of it.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">When sick in bed
afflicted with a zymotic disease, with violent fever, or with fever
after an accident or injury, he becomes greatly prostrated, stupid
and unconscious. He can be aroused and will answer a question
correctly, but goes back into a stupor, or he hesitates about a
word, is unable to find correct words when trying to answer, and
goes back into the coma. When roused up, he looks at the doctor and
says: "I do not want you; I did not send for you; I am not sick; I
don't need a doctor." He will say this even when he is seriously
ill. I have seen an Arnica patient lie back upon his pillow after
emptying the stomach of a black fluid like blood, seriously ill,
with the face mottled, in zymotic sickness or such as threaten
malignant chill, that one would think he was almost going to die,
look up and say? "I am not sick; I did not send for you; go home."
Yet when in a state of health he was friendly, kind-hearted, knew
me well, glad to shake hands with me; but now he is irritated at
seeing me there and insists there is nothing the matter with him.
Such is the "shock" state, almost a delirium. After finishing such
a sentence, he will lie down in a stupor, will lie in bed drawn up
in a heap and merely groan when spoken to. He wants to be left
alone, does not want to be bothered, does not want to be talked to.
That state ushers in complaints after a shock that has shaken the
whole system that has disturbed the circulation. When a symptomatic
typhoid is coming on, i.e., when an intermittent or remittent is
taking on symptoms that are typhoid in character, when the tongue
becomes shiny, and sores appear about the teeth and lips, when
there is sinking, and soreness all over the body, there are times
when this mental state that I am describing will appear and the
patient must have Arnica. Arnica will interrupt the progress and
prevent a typhoid state. Arnica is sometimes suitable to the
scarlet fever, when the eruption does not come out, in those severe
forms when the body is dusky, mottled and covered with red spots;
the patient is constantly turning and that mental state is coming
on with moroseness, and stupidity. It is a wonderful remedy, a
misunderstood remedy, a misused remedy, because it is almost
limited to bruises. It is one of the sheet anchors in certain
seasons, in the malarial valleys of the West, for intermittent
fever. In congestive chills, in those dreadful attacks with
prostration, stupor, mottled skin, with congestion that comes on
suddenly, with anxiety. The doctors know these fevers, they dread
them, and can only cope with them by using such remedies as Arnica
and LACHESIS and other deep-acting medicines. It is not true that
these patients must have QUININE. For many years, I practiced among
these cases, and I have seen numerous congestive chills and had no
need for QUININE. I would rather have my repertory and a few
potencies than all the QUININE in the drug stores. The sugar pills
cure safely, permanently and gently, while the QUININE never cures,
but suppresses, and there is nothing in the after history of that
patient drugged with QUININE and ARS. but congestion and violence
so long as he lives.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Horror of instant
death, with cardiac distress in night." From that, it spreads on
throughout the system, but that horror of instant death is a
striking feature and it comes on regardless of heart disease. A
horror in the night when there is nothing to come upon the patient;
a horrible congestion, which affects especially the cerebellum and
upper part of the spinal cord.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Stupor with
involuntary discharges." "Coma, insensibility." "Lies as if dead."
These symptoms come in the low forms of disease, in the typhoid
type of disease. Many of the remittent fevers, if badly treated, or
permitted to run their course under bad nursing, will turn into a
continued fever. While the true idiopathic typhoid comes on after
many weeks of gradual decline, a symptomatic typhoid may come on
suddenly, and it has symptoms of graver form than the ordinary
typhoid. The idiopathic typhoid will seldom kill and will generally
run to a favourable termination, if the doctor stays at home. This
remedy is full of delirium in these low types of fever, even
delirium like delirium tremens. "Hopelessness; indifference."
"Hypochondriacal anxiety, peevishness." "Fears being struck by
those coming towards him." That is both bodily and
mental.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Now, with this
mental state thoroughly in mind, we are prepared to take up the
general physical state, which has in all complaints, all over the
body a feeling as if bruised. It is not strange that Arnica is used
for bruises, but it is very foolish to put it on the outside and to
rub it on in the form of the tincture. It produces in its
pathogenesis mottled spots, like bruises. If you take Arnica
internally, in large doses, you will have mottled spots, bluish
spots, which become yellowish, due to ecchymoses, from
extravasations of the smaller capillaries. This is, to a certain
extent, what takes place in bruising. It is an extravasation of
blood from the capillaries, and sometimes from the larger vessels.
But all over the body he is sore and bruised, as if he had been
beaten. If you watch an Arnica patient in order to get the external
manifestations of his state, you will see him turning and moving.
You will at once ask yourself. Why is he restless? And if you
compare remedies in your mind, you will say, he is like RHUS-T.; he
stays in a place a little while and then he moves. No matter if, he
is only semi-conscious, you will see him make a little turn, part
way over, and then a little further over, and so on until he is
over on the other side. Then he commences again, and he will shift
a little and a little, and so he turns from side to side. The
question is, why does he move so, why is he restless? It is an
important matter to solve. We notice the awful ANXIETY of the
ARSENICUM patient that keeps him moving all the time. We notice the
PAINFUL UNEASINESS felt all over the body with the RHUS. patient so
that he cannot keep still. The Arnica patient is so SORE that he
can lie on one part only a little while, and then he must get off
that part or to the other side. So if we ask him, "Why do you move
so?" he will tell us that the bed feels hard. That is one way of
telling that the body is sore. A more intelligent individual will
say it is because he is so sore and feels as if bruised and beaten,
and he wants to get into a new place. This state of soreness is
present if it be a symptomatic typhoid, an intermittent fever, a
remittent fever, or after an injury when he is really bruised all
over. You get the same continual uneasiness and motion, moving
every minute. He moves and thinks that now he will be comfortable,
but he is comfortable only for a second. The soreness increases the
longer he lies, and becomes so great that he is forced to move.
With RHUS- T. the longer he lies the more restless he grows and the
more he aches, until he feels as if he will fly if he does not
move. With RHUS-T. the uneasiness passes off after moving, and with
Arnica, the soreness passes off if he gets into a new place. With
ARSENICUM, you see him moving about and look wild, he is anxious,
this anxiety forces him to move, and he gets no rest, for he keeps
going. The RHUS-T. and Arnica patients get better from every little
motion.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">PHYSICAL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Arnica patient
bleeds easily; his blood vessels seem to be relaxed, and
extravasation is easy. Blue spots come easily upon the skin, and
internally the mucous membranes bleed easily. The parts that are
inflamed bleed. He is subject to catarrhal conditions, and if he
has a cough, he bleeds easily. The mucus that is hawked out of the
chest and throat is streaked with blood, or dotted with tiny
pin-head blood clots. His urine contains blood and there is
bleeding from the various orifices of the body. There is not
sufficient tone in the fibres of the vessel to hold the blood
within the vessel walls and they ooze.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">All over the body
there is a lameness, and soreness, and a feeling as if bruised; a
rheumatic lameness; the joints are swollen, sore and lame. If an
acute disease becomes more severe, we shall find the mental
symptoms as described, and there will be an increasing soreness in
the muscles. Arnica is very suitable for that sore, bruised
condition of the body; therefore Arnica is a very important remedy
in injuries, bruises and shocks, injuries of joints, injury of the
back with lameness and soreness. In such conditions, Arnica becomes
one of the first remedies, and unless there are general decided
symptoms calling for other remedies it should be the first remedy.
Arnica will very often take all the soreness out of a sprained
ankle and permit him in a few days to go walking about, to the
surprise of everybody. The black and blue appearance of sprained
joints will go away in a surprisingly short time, the soreness will
disappear, and he will be able to manipulate that joint with
surprising ease. I have seen a sprained ankle when it was black and
blue, so swollen that the shoe could not be put on, but after a
dose of Arnica, the swelling disappeared in an astonishing way, the
discoloration faded out and the patient was able to stand on the
foot. No such result can be obtained with the use of Arnica lotion
externally. A high potency of Arnica is most satisfactory in
bruises, and when no decided contra-indication is present Arnica is
the first remedy; but for the weakness of tendons that follows such
a condition Arnica is not always sufficient, and then RHUS-T. is
its natural follower. If the weakness and tenderness remain in the
joints, follow the RHUS-T with CALC. One will not, of course, give
these remedies all on the same day, and not in the same glass, but
will wait until all the good has been gotten out of the Arnica
before following with RHUS-T. It is quite a common thing for aching
and restlessness and weakness to come into a part that has been
injured, and RHUS-T is then a suitable remedy; and it is quite
common for a joint that has been badly treated to remain gore and
weak, and then CALC. comes in as a natural follower of the RHUS-T.
Now and then we have to resort to CAUST., STAPH., and other
remedies, because of some peculiar feature in the case, but these
remedies are all related more or less to Arnica, RHUS-T and CALC.
For another class of injuries compare LED. and HYPER.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Arnica is useful in
some chronic cases; especially in old cases of gout. It is quite a
common thing for old cases of gout to rouse up into a new soreness
of joints, with great sensitiveness. You will see the old
grandfather sit off in a corner of the room, and if he sees little
Johnnie running towards him, he will say, "Oh, do keep away, keep
away." Give him a dose of Arnica and he will let Johnnie run all
over him. He does not want to be touched or approached; he feels
that anything that is coming towards him is going to hurt him. He
is extremely sensitive, his joints are sore and tender, and he is
afraid they will be hurt.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This medicine has
erysipelatous inflammation. If you have erysipelas of the face with
the mental state described, with soreness, and sore, bruised
feeling all-over the body, you need not wait longer before
prescribing Arnica. The sore, bruised feeling all over the body,
and the mental state, would decide in favour of Arnica against any
medicine. In inflammation of the kidneys and bladder, of the liver,
and even in pneumonia, the mental state and the sore, bruised
feeling all over the body would enable you to do astonishing work
in such cases, even though Arnica has never produced pneumonia. It
has all there is of the rusty expectoration, with all the soreness
of the chest and catarrhal state, the coughing and gagging, and
sore, bruised feeling all over the body, and then adds to this the
condition of stupor and the mental state that belongs to the
inflammatory condition of any organ and is especially strong in
this medicine. We do not have to worry about any particular
fineness of diagnosis to settle upon Arnica.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Arnica has aversion
to meat, broth and milk. There is great thirst at particular times;
for instance, DURING THE CHILL of intermittent fever he has thirst,
while at other times he is thirstless. "Vomiting of dark-red
coagula, mouth bitter; general soreness." Vomiting of black, inky
substances.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">ABDOMEN</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Arnica is a useful
remedy in inflammatory conditions of the abdomen, liver,
intestines, with tumefaction, tympanites, prostration, tendency to
uneasiness, and so sore that he cannot be touched. This state also
comes with typhoid. Do not forget the symptoms of Arnica in
appendicitis. You do not need to run for the surgeon for every case
of appendicitis if you know BRY., RHUS-T., BELL., Arnica and
similar remedies. The homeopathic remedy will cure these cases,
and, if you know it, you need never run after the surgeon in
appendicitis except in recurrent attacks. If you do not know your
remedies, you will succumb to the prevailing notion that it is
necessary to open the abdomen and remove the appendix. It is only
deplorable ignorance that causes appendicitis to be surrendered to
the knife.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOOL-URINE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Offensiveness is a
feature of Arnica; there is offensiveness of the eructations, and
of the flatus. The stool is horribly offensive. "Nightly
diarrhoea." "Stool involuntary during sleep." "Stools of undigested
food, purulent; bloody, slimy, mucus." Dark blood, very foetid
stool. Here we see the tendency to oozing from the mucous
membranes. Black watery stools with black vomit. "Retention of
urine from exertion," from overwork, from injury, from concussion
of the brain, from some violent accident. The urine is brown, or
inky, dark. "Piercing pains as from knives plunged into the
kidneys." "Urine very acid, with increase of specific
gravity."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-FEMALE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Another feature of
Arnica occurs in pregnant women. The extreme sensitiveness,
soreness or tenderness throughout the whole body is especially felt
in the abdominal viscera, in the uterus and pelvic region.
Sensitiveness to the motion of the foetus, sore and bruised; the
motions of the foetus are very painful and keep her awake all
night. Arnica will remove that soreness and she will not
distinguish the motion of the foetus. It is not an increased motion
of the foetus, but that she is sensitive to it. "Constant dribbling
of urine after labor."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">FEVER</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A general feature
also of the remedy is that the body is cold and the head hot; the
whole body and the extremities are cold, but the head feels hot.
This is a marked condition in sudden congestive attacks, in
congestive chill and congestive intermittent fevers. This,
sometimes, is the very beginning of a severe attack when there has
been almost no warning except a night or two of bad dreams and
distress, fear-fulness and stupefaction, with soreness in the body.
If he comes out of this, an increased soreness in the body comes
on, which grows worse and worse until he is sore and bruised all
over. Children going into severe attacks of infantile fever may
threaten convulsions, the head is hot and the body cold. Most
physicians will think of BELLADONNA, which has such cold
extremities and such a hot head. Do not forget Arnica, especially
in those children who seem to have an aversion to being touched,
and scream out every time the mother takes hold of the leg or arm.
Look into the history a little and you will see that this is a
soreness, and if you strip the child, you may observe dusky spots,
which give an added indication of Arnica.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">COUGH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This is a
whooping-cough remedy; you can easily conjure up what the
indications are for whooping-cough; aggravation from touch, sore,
bruised condition, spasmodic cough with expectoration of blood, or
dark blood-streaked mucus, or little tiny pin-head dots all through
the mucus. Vomiting of food with black mucus. The mental state of
the child can easily be imagined. The child is cross and fretful.
"Cough excited by cries in children when accompanied by anger and
tossing about." "Paroxysms of cough at night." "Whooping cough;
child cries before paroxysms as though in fear of soreness." You
can easily apply that which we have seen in the remedy to the
various diseases that come on. Stitching pains in whooping cough,
pleuritic pains with catarrh of the chest, with pneumonia or
pleurisy, inflammatory conditions. It has also more lingering
complaints, "fatty degeneration of the heart." Stitches in the
cardiac region, stitches from left to right. "Weary, bruised, sore,
great weakness, must lie down, yet bed feels too hard."</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It will be well to
read over all these symptoms; there are numerous particulars in the
remedy, many little symptoms that are of great interest.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It follows well
after ACON. and is complementary to ACON., IP. and
VERAT.</span></p>
