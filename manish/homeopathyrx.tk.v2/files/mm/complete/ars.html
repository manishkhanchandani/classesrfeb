<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="cs7062CF40">ARSENICUM
ALBUM</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs7062CF40">(Ars.)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">From the time of
Hahnemann to the present day Arsenicum has been one of the most
frequently indicated medicines, and one of the most extensively
used. In the Old School it is most extensively abused, in the form
of Fowler's solution.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Ars. affects every
part of man; it seems to exaggerate or depress almost all his
faculties, to excite or disturb all his functions. When all our
medicines have been as well proved we will affect wonderful cures.
It is a substance easily proved because of its active nature, and
from its very abuse we have learned much of its general nature.
While Arsenic impresses the whole economy and disturbs all the
functions and tissues of man, there are certain prevailing and
striking features in it. ANXIETY, RESTLESSNESS, PROSTRATION,
BURNING and CADAVERIC ODORS are prominent characteristics. The
surface of the body is pale, cold, clammy, and sweating, and the
aspect is cadaveric. In chronic sickness with great debility,
anaemia, from long exposure to malarial influence, in the poorly
fed and from syphilis this remedy is of great service.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MENTAL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The ANXIETY that is
found in Ars. is intermingled with fear, with impulses, with
suicidal inclinations, with sudden freaks and with mania. It has
delusions and various kinds of insanity; in the more active form,
delirium and excitement. SADNESS prevails to a great extreme. So
sad that he is weary of life; he loathes life, and wants to die,
and the Arsenic patient does commit suicide. It is a remedy full of
SUICIDAL TENDENCIES. The anxiety takes form also in the
restlessness, in which he constantly moves. If he is able to get up
he goes from chair to chair; the child goes from nurse to mother,
and from one person to another. When in bed, unable to sit up, the
patient tosses and turns from side to side; if he is able, he
climbs out of bed and sits in the chair, keeps moving from one
place to another, and, when thoroughly exhausted, he gets back into
bed again. The restlessness seems to be, mostly in the mind; it is
an anxious restlessness, or anguish, with the idea that anguish is
a deathly anxiety. That is an effort to express it in the extreme.
It seems that he cannot live, and it is not pain that drives him to
anguish, but it is an anxiety intermingled with restlessness and
sadness. This state prevails in all diseases intermingled with
prostration. An uneasiness comes in the early stage of disease, and
lasts but until the prostration becomes marked. While lying in bed,
at first he moves his whole body, moves himself in bed and out of
bed; but the prostration becomes so marked that he is able to move
only his limbs until at last he becomes so weak that he is no
longer able to move and he lies in perfect quiet in extreme
prostration. It seems that prostration takes the place of anxiety
and restlessness, and he appears like a cadaver. So remember that
these states of anxiety and restlessness go towards the cadaveric
aspect, towards death. This is seen, for instance, in the typhoid,
where Arsenicum is indicated. At first there is that anxious
restlessness with fear, but the increasing weakness tends towards
prostration.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">PHYSICAL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Running all through
the remedy there is the BURNING mentioned as one of its most marked
generals. There is burning in the brain, which makes him want to
wash his head in cold water. This sensation of heat in the inner
head with pulsation is ameliorated by the cold bathing, but when
there is a rheumatic state that affects the scalp and outward
nerves, and there is burning, the burning then is ameliorated by
heat. When the headache is of a congestive character, with the
sensation of heat and burning inside the head, and there is a
feeling as if the head would burst, and the face is flushed and
hot, that headache is better from cold applications and in the cool
open air. So marked is this that I have seen the patient sitting in
the room with clothing piled on to keep the body warm and with the
window open to relieve the congestion of the head. Therefore, we
say a striking feature belonging to this medicine is relief of all
the complaints of the body from wrapping up and from warmth in
general, and relief of the complaints of the head by cold, except
the external complaints of the head, which are better from heat and
from wrapping up. The neuralgias of the face and eyes, and above
the eyes, are better from heat.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The burning is felt
in the stomach; there is burning in the bladder, in the vagina, in
the lungs. It feels as if coals of fire were in the lungs at times,
when gangrenous inflammation is threatened, and in certain stages
of pneumonia. There is burning in the throat and burning in all the
mucous membranes. The skin burns with itching, and he scratches
until the skin is raw, and then it burns, but the itching ceases;
as soon as the smarting lets up a trifle the itching commences
again. All night the itching and burning alternate, burning for a
minute, when he scratches it until it is raw, but soon the itching
begins J again and it seems that he has no rest.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The secretions and
excretions of Arsenicum are ACRID; they excoriate the parts,
causing burning. The discharge from the nose and eyes causes
redness around the parts, and this is true of all the fluids from
the various orifices. In ulcers there is burning, and the thin,
bloody fluid discharged excoriates the parts round about. The ODOR
of the discharge is PUTRID. If you have ever discovered the odor of
gangrene, of mortified flesh, you know the odor of the Arsenicum
discharges. The stool is putrid, like decomposed flesh, putrid
blood. The discharges from the uterus, the menstrual flow, the
leucorrhoea, the faeces, the urine, the expectoration, all the
discharges are putrid. The ulcer is so putrid that it smells like
decomposing flesh.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Arsenic produces a
tendency to BLEEDING. The patient bleeds easily and may bleed from
any place. There is vomiting of blood; bleeding from the lungs and
throat. Bloody discharge from the mucous membrane, at times, when
inflammation is running high; haemorrhagia from the bowels,
kidneys, bladder and uterus; anywhere that mucous membrane exists,
there may be haemorrhagia. Haemorrhagia of black blood and
discharges that are offensive.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">GANGRENE and sudden
inflammatory conditions like gangrenous and erysipelatous
inflammations are common in Arsenic. Parts suddenly take on
erysipelas, or parts that are injured suddenly take on gangrene.
Gangrene in internal organs, malignant inflammations, erysipelatous
inflammation. No matter how you look upon the condition, no matter
what it is called, if it is a sudden inflammation that tends to
produce malignancy in the part it belongs to Arsenicum.
Inflammation will go on in the bowels for a few days attended with
a horribly offensive discharge, vomiting of clots of blood, great
burning in the bowels with tympanitic condition. You may almost
look upon this as a gangrenous inflammation, so violent, sudden and
malignant is it, and it has the anxiety, prostration, fear of
death, and chilliness, the patient wanting to be covered warmly.
When with this inflammation of the bowels the patient is relieved
by heat, it means Ars. You should remember that SEC. has a similar
state; it has all the tympanitic condition, all the ulceration and
prostration, all the offensive odor and expulsion of offensive
clots, and all the burning, but the SEC. patient wants to be
uncovered, wants things cold, wants the windows open. The only
distinguishing feature between these two remedies in a case may be
that SEC. wants cold and Arsenicum wants heat, but this is the way
we individualize in our homeopathic prescribing. When there is
gangrenous inflammation in the lungs, we find the patient has been
taken with a chill, there has been restlessness, prostration,
anxiety and fear; as we enter the room we detect a horrible odor,
and on looking into the pan we see the patient has been spitting up
by the mouthful, black, foul expectoration. Look and see if the
patient wants to be covered warmly; if he is easily chilled, and
heat feels good; then it is a hard thing to cover that case outside
of Arsenicum. The prostration, the vomiting, the anxiety, the
restlessness, the cadaveric aspect are present, and where will you
find a remedy with that totality outside of Ars.? I have many times
gone a long distance to detect, from the very aspect of things,
these symptoms that could be gotten while walking from the door to
the bedside. Every symptom is Arsenicum; he looks like it, acts
like it and smells like it. You may go to a patient with high grade
inflammation of the bladder, with frequent urging to urinate,
straining to urinate, and there is bloody urine intermingled with
clots. It has been found by the attending physician when he
introduces the catheter to draw off the urine that clots dam up the
catheter, a little is drawn off and then it stops. We have a
history of restlessness, anxiety, fear of death, amelioration from
heat, great prostration. You must give Ars., not because there is
inflammation of the bladder, but because it is a rapidly
progressing inflammation, and because it is gangrenous in
character. The whole bladder will be involved in a short time, but
Arsenic will stop that. So it is with all the internal organs, the
liver, lungs, etc.; any of them may take on violent and rapid
inflammation. We are not now speaking of the particulars, but only
illustrating the general state of Ars., in order to bring out what
runs through the whole nature of it. We shall find when we take up
the remedy and go through it in a more particular way these
features will stand out everywhere.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The MENTAL symptoms
show in the beginning anxious restlessness, and from this a
continuation towards delirium and even insanity with all that it
involves; disturbance of the intellect and will. "He thinks he must
die." I went to the bedside of a typhoid patient once with all the
general aspect I have described; he was able to talk, and he looked
up at me and said: "There is no use of your coming, I am going to
die; you might as well go home; my whole insides are mortifying."
His friend was seated on one side of the bed, giving him a few
drops of water, and just about as often as he could get there with
it he wanted it again. That was all he wanted; his mouth was black,
parched and dry. He got Arsenicum. One of the characteristic
features of Arsenicum, is THIRST FOR SMALL QUANTITIES OFTEN, just
enough to wet the mouth. It is commonly used as a distinguishing
feature between BRYONIA and Arsenicum for the purpose of
memorizing, that BRYONIA has thirst for large quantities far apart,
but Arsenicum little and often, or violent unquenchable
thirst.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Thoughts of death
and of the incurability of his complaints." "Thoughts crowd upon
him; he is too weak to keep them off or to hold on to one idea."
That is, he lies in bed tormented day and night by depressing ideas
and distressing thoughts. This is one form of his anxiety; when
tormented with thoughts, he is anxious. In the delirium he sees all
kinds of vermin on his bed. "Picks the bedclothes." "Delirium
during sleep, unconscious mania." "Whimpering and gnashing teeth."
"Loud moaning, groaning and weeping." "Lamentations, despair of
life." "Screaming with pains." "Fear drives him out of bed, he
hides in a closet." These are instances of insanity that take on
first a state of anxiety, restlessness, and fear. Religious
insanity, with the delusion that she has sinned away her day of
grace, the biblical promises of salvation do not apply to her,
there is no hope for her, she is doomed to punishment. She has been
thinking on religious matters until she is insane. Finally she
enters into a more complete insane state, a state of tranquillity;
silent, and with aversion to talk. So we see one stage enters into
another; we have to take the whole case together; we have to note
the course that the case has run in order to see it clearly and
note that in one stage there were certain symptoms and, in another
stage, other symptoms. For instance, we know that in the ACUTE
conditions of Arsenicum there is either thirst for ice cold water,
and for only enough to moisten the mouth, or there is thirst for
water in large quantities and yet it does not quench the thirst;
but this thirsty stage goes on to another in which there is
aversion to water, and hence we see that in CHRONIC diseases
Arsenicum is thirst less. So it is in a case of mania; in the
chronic state he is tranquil, but in the earlier stages, in order
to be an Arsenicum case, he must have gone through the Arsenicum
restlessness, anxiety and fear.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">FEAR is a strong
element in the mental state, fear to be alone; fears something is
going to injure him when he is alone; full of horror; he dreads
solitude and wants company, because in company he can talk and put
off the fear; but as this insanity increases he fails to appreciate
company and the fear comes in spite of it. He has a violent
increase of his fear and horror in the dark and many complaints
come on in the evening as darkness is coming on. Many of the mental
troubles, as well as the physical troubles, come on and are
increased at certain times. While some complaints, pains and aches
are worse in the morning, most of the sufferings of Arsenicum are
worse from 1-2 p.m. and from 1-2 a.m. After midnight, very soon
after midnight sometimes, his sufferings begin, and from 1-2
o'clock they are intensified. Extreme anxiety in the evening in
bed.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Averse to meeting
acquaintances, because he imagines he has formerly offended them."
Great mental depression, great sadness, melancholy, despair,
despair of recovery. He has dread of death when alone, or on going
to bed, with anxiety and restlessness. He thinks he is going to die
and wants somebody with him. The attacks of anxiety at night drive
him out of bed. This is an anxiety that affects the heart, and so
the mental anxiety and cardiac anxiety almost seem to coincide. A
sudden anxious fear comes over him at night; he jumps out of bed
with fear that he is going to die, or that he is going to
suffocate. It is full of dyspnoea, cardiac dyspnoea, and varying
forms of asthma. The spells come on in the evening in bed or after
midnight; from 1-2 o'clock he is attacked with mental anxiety,
dyspnoea, fear of death, coldness, and is covered with cold sweat.
"Anxiety like one who has committed murder." This is one form of
his anxiety; he finally works up to the idea that the officers are
coming after him, and watches to see if they are coming in to
arrest him. Some unusual evil is going to happen to him; always
looking for something terrible to happen. "Irritable, discouraged,
restless." "Restlessness cannot rest anywhere." "As a consequence
of fright, inclination to commit suicide."</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Arsenicum
patient with this mental state is ALWAYS FREEZING hovers around the
fire, cannot get clothing enough to keep warm, a great sufferer
from the cold. Chronic Arsenicum invalids cannot get warm; they are
always chilly, pale and waxy, and in such invalids, after they have
had several unusual weak spells, dropsical conditions come on.
Arsenicum is full of puffiness and dropsy; oedematous condition of
the extremities; dropsy of the shut sacs or of the cavities;
swelling about the eyes; swelling of the face, so that it pits upon
pressure. Arsenicum in these swellings is especially related to the
lower eyelid rather than the upper, while in KALI-C. the swelling
is more in the upper eyelid than the lower, between the lid and the
brow. There are times when KALI-C. looks very similar to Arsenic,
and little features like that will be distinguishing points. If
they run together in generals, then we must observe their
particular peculiarities.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the HEADACHES we
have a striking general feature of Arsenicum, brought out in their
periodicity. Running all through this remedy there is PERIODICITY,
and for this reason it has been extensively useful in malarial
affections which have, as a characteristic of their nature,
periodicity. The periodical complaints of Arsenic come on every
other day, or every fourth day, or every seven days, or every two
weeks. The headaches come on these cycles, every other, or third,
or fourth, seventh or fourteenth day. The more chronic the
complaint is, the longer is its cycle, so that we will find the
more acute and sharp troubles in which Arsenic is suitable will
have every other day aggravations and every fourth day
aggravations: but, as the trouble becomes chronic and deep-seated,
it takes on the seventh day aggravation, and in the psoric
manifestations of a long, lingering and deep-seated kind there is a
fourteenth day aggravation. This appearing in cycles is common to a
good many remedies, but is especially marked in CHIN. and Arsenic.
These two remedies are similar to each other in many respects, and
they are quite similar in their general nature to the
manifestations that often occur in malaria. It is true, however,
that Arsenic is more frequently indicated than CHIN. In every
epidemic of malarial fever that I have gone through I have found
Arsenicum symptoms more common than those of CHINA.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">These headaches
bring out the interesting point that we mentioned above. Arsenicum
has in its nature AN ALTERNATION OF STATES, and this carries with
it certain generals. Arsenicum in all of its bodily complaints is a
cold remedy; the patient sits over the fire and shivers, wants
plenty of clothing, and wants to be in a warm room. So long as the
complaints are in the body this is so; but when the complaints are
in the head, while he wants the body warm he wants the head washed
in cold water, or wants the cold air upon it. The complaints of the
head must conform to the generals that apply to the head, and the
complaints of the body must be associated with the generals that
apply to the body. It is a difficult thing to say which one of
these two circumstances is most general, and it is sometimes
difficult to say which one is the general of the patient himself,
because he confuses you by saying: "I am worse in the cold," but
when his headache is on he says: "I am better in the cold, I want
to be in the cold." It is really only the head, and you have to
single these out and study them by the parts affected. When things
are so striking you must examine into it to see what it is that
brings about the modality. You will see a similar state running
through PHOSPHORUS; the complaints of the stomach and head are
better from cold, i.e., he wants cold applications upon the head
with head sufferings, and wants cold things in the stomach with
stomach complaints, but in all the complaints of the body he is
ameliorated from heat. If he steps out into the cool air, he will
commence to cough, if he has a chest trouble. So we see that the
modalities that belong to the part affected must always be taken
into account. For instance, you have a patient suffering from
neuralgia or rheumatic affections and these same pains extend to
the head, then he wants the head wrapped up because they are
ameliorated from heat. But when it comes to cases of congestive
conditions of the head, he then is better with his head very cold.
Now, as I have said, there is an alternation of these states in
Arsenicum. I will illustrate by mentioning a case. Once a patient
had been dragging along with periodical sick headaches. The sick
headaches were better from cold water, cold applications to the
head, could hardly get them cold enough, and the colder the better.
These headaches came every two weeks, and so long as they were
present he desired cold to the head. Then these periodical
headaches would be better, for long periods; but when they were
away he was suffering from rheumatism of the joints, which was also
periodical, and also more or less tenacious, and when this
rheumatism of the joints and extremities, with more or less
swelling and oedema, was present he could not get warm enough; he
was at the fire and wrapped up; he was relieved by heat, and wanted
warm air and a warm room. This would last for a period and then
subside, and back would come his sick headaches and last for a
while. That is what I meant by the alternation of states. Arsenicum
cured that man, and he never had any of them afterwards. The
alternation of states sometimes means that there are two diseases
in the body, and sometimes the remedy covers the whole feature in
alternation of states. I remember another case, which will
illustrate this peculiar nature of alternation of complaints, which
is shared by other remedies besides Ars. A patient suffered from a
pressure in the top of the head, such as I recently described to
you under ALUMEN. She would suffer for weeks from that pressure on
the top of the head, and the only relief she could get was from
hard pressure; she tired herself out with hard pressure and would
contrive all kinds of weights to put upon the head. That would go
away in the night and she would wake up the next morning with
constant urging to urinate. The irritable bladder alternated with
pain on top of the head. ALUMEN cured. In many of these anti-psoric
remedies we have an alternation of states. This illustrates the
necessity for getting the symptoms of all the states that present
themselves for cure, otherwise you will many times prescribe in a
chronic case of psoric character and temporarily relieve it, when
back comes another aspect of it. You have only hastened the disease
a little faster than it would go if let alone. But that is not
homeopathic prescribing. Be sure, when a remedy presents one state,
that it is as clearly indicated in the other state, otherwise that
remedy is not the simillimum. You must hunt until you find the
remedy that has both states, or you will be disappointed. We
sometimes do not discover this alternation of states until we have
brought it back two or three times by incorrect prescribing. Some
people are so reticent and so difficult to get symptoms from that
we do not always get these symptoms. But you examine your record
and you find where you have made a foolish prescription that you
drove a new condition away and back came the first trouble, and you
kept on with this see-saw business. Now remember in doing this your
patient is not improving, and that you must re-study the whole
case, taking the alternating states into account. In Arsenicum, the
head symptoms alternate with physical symptoms. You will find
running through certain remedies, as a part of their nature, that
mental symptoms alternate with physical symptoms; when the physical
symptoms are present, then mental symptoms are not traites the
necessity for getting the symptoms of all the states that is
determined it is a good point, but sometimes you do not find a
remedy, because many of our remedies are not well recorded; they
have not yet been observed in their alternations and marked as
such. We find in PODO. the peculiar feature that the headaches
alternate with diarrhoea; he is subject to sick headaches and to
diarrhoea and one or other will be present. In ARNICA the mental
symptoms alternate with uterine symptoms. The uterine symptoms,
when observed, look like ARNICA, but these go away in the night and
mental symptoms come on, the mind being heavy, gloomy and cloudy.
When we have remedies that have these manifestations it requires a
greater depth of vision to see the alternation of states, because
these things are not always brought out in the proving, for the
reason that one prover had one group of symptoms, and another,
another. Yet a remedy that is capable of bringing out the two
groups of symptoms is sufficient to cure this alternation of
states.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The periodical
headaches of Arsenic are found in all parts of the head. They are
the congestive headaches with throbbing and burning, with anxiety
and restlessness; hot head and relief from cold. There are
headaches in the forehead, which are throbbing, worse from light,
intensified from motion, often attended with great restlessness,
forcing him to move, with great anxiety. Most of the headaches are
attended with nausea and vomiting. The sick headaches are of the
worst sort, especially those that come every two weeks. In some of
these old, broken-down constitutions you will find he is cold,
pallid, sickly; he is always chilly and freezing except when the
headache is on, and it is better from cold; the face much wrinkled,
great anxiety and no desire for water. Remember that it was said in
the acute state of Arsenicum there is thirst, thirst for little and
often, dry mouth and desire for water enough to moisten the lips,
but in the chronic states of Arsenic he is generally thirstless.
There are headaches on one side of the head involving the scalp,
one-half of the head, worse from motion, better from cold washing,
better from walking in the cold air, though very often the jar or
stepping starts up a feeling as of a wave of pain, shakings
vibration or looseness in the brain; such are the sensations and
these are conditions of pulsation. Then there are dreadful
occipital headaches, so severe that the patient feels stunned or
dazed. They come on after midnight, from excitement, from exertion;
they come on from becoming heated in walking, which produces
determination of blood to the head. NAT-M. is a medicine analogous
to this in its periodicity and in many of its complaints. It has
congestive headaches from walking and becoming heated; especially
from walking in the sun. The Arsenicum headaches are generally
worse from light and noise, better from lying down in a dark room,
lying with the head on two pillows. Many of the headaches commence
in the afternoon from 1 to 3 o'clock, after the noon meal, grow
worse into the afternoon, lasting all night. They are often
attended with great pallor, nausea, prostration, deathly weakness.
The pain is paroxysmal; violent head pain during the chill of an
intermittent fever; headache as if the skull would burst during an
intermittent fever. Arsenicum has this head pain of a congestive
character in intermittent fever, as if the head would burst. A
peculiar feature of the thirst is that there is no thirst during
the chill except for hot drinks; during the heat there is thirst
little and often for water enough to moisten the mouth, which is
almost no thirst, and during the sweat there is thirst for large
drinks. Thirst begins with the beginning of the heat and increases
as the dryness of the mouth increases; he desires only to moisten
the mouth until he breaks out in a sweat, and then the thirst
becomes a desire for large quantities very often, and the more he
sweats the more desire he has for water. The headache is during the
chill; it increases, so that it becomes a congestive, throbbing
headache during the chill and heat; this grows better towards the
end of the heat as the sweat breaks out, it is ameliorated by the
sweat.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In chronic
headaches, congestive headaches and malarial complaints, a TENDENCY
to SHRIVEL is observed upon the skin; a prematurely old, wrinkled
appearance of the skin comes on. The mucous membrane of the lips
and mouth often shrivels and becomes wrinkled. This is also found
in the diphtheritic membrane of the throat as a peculiar feature of
Arsenic, and belongs, as far as I know, to no other remedy. The
exudation in the throat is leathery looking and shrivelled. A
shrivelled membrane is not a sure indication for Arsenic, but when
Arsenic is indicated you would be likely to find this kind of
membrane; such cases as are very malignant in character, very
offensive, putrid, those with a gangrenous odor.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">At times the head is
in constant motion when there are complaints in the body, because
parts of the body are too sore to be moved; then the motion of the
head comes on because of restlessness and uneasiness, and he keeps
it in motion even though it does not ameliorate. The face and head
are subject to oedema; dropsy of the scalp and erysipelatous
inflammation of the face and head. The scalp pits upon pressure and
there is a little crepitation under it from pressure. The scalp is
subject to eruptions and is very sensitive. So sensitive is the
scalp that the hair cannot be combed; it seems as if the touch of
the comb or brush when rubbing over the scalp went into the
brain.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">SENSITIVENESS is a
feature of Arsenic; sensitiveness to smell and touch;
oversensitiveness of all the senses. A peculiar feature that
perhaps I have not brought out is the oversensitiveness to the
circumstances and surroundings of the room. The Arsenicum patient
is an extremely fastidious patient. Hering once described him as
"the gold-headed cane patient." If this is carried out in a woman
who is sick in bed she is in great distress if every picture on the
wall does not hang perfectly straight. Those who are sensitive to
disorder and confusion and are disturbed and made worse until
everything is placed in order have a morbid fastidiousness which
has its simillimum in Arsenic.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The eye symptoms of
this remedy are very prominent. In old cases of suppressed malaria,
in broken down constitutions, in pallid, sickly people who are
subject to general catarrhal conditions, and such catarrhal
conditions as localize more especially in the nose and eyes, the
eye symptoms will be troublesome. There are discharges from the
eyes. It may be conjunctivitis, in a general way involving the lids
and the globe, going on sometimes to ulceration with thin, bloody
discharge, increasing to thick, acrid discharge that excoriates the
eye, making the canthi red and causing granulation with burning.
The burning is better from washing in cool water and also better
from dry heat. Very often ulcers appear on the globe of the eye,
often upon the cornea. It has various kinds of hypertrophy
beginning in patches that will form scars, and in old ulcerated
patches little growth similar to a pterygium growing towards the
centre of the eye and threatening blindness. The inflammations are
sometimes attended with swelling, burning and excoriating
discharge; this swelling is bag-like in character, and so we find
"baggy" lids and little bags forming under the eyes. The face is
waxy and pale, presenting the appearance of a broken down
constitution or a dropsical condition.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The catarrhal state
involves throat and nose, and it is sometimes difficult to separate
the nose symptoms from the throat symptoms. The Arsenicum patient
is always taking cold in the nose, always sneezing from every
change in the weather. He is always chilly and suffers from drafts,
and is worse in cold, damp weather; always freezing, chilled
through. These pale, waxy, broken down constitutions with catarrhal
discharges from the nose on looking at a bright light become blind.
Sneezing and coryza with inflammatory conditions through the whole
nasal cavity, throat, larynx and chest. The cold begins in the nose
and goes down into the throat, very often causing hoarseness with
dry, tickling, hard, rasping cough. It is a difficult matter to
find remedies for a coryza that begins in the nose and extends into
the chest with bronchial troubles; very often you require a change
of remedy, as the chest symptoms often run to a different remedy.
It is difficult to find a remedy that covers the symptoms of both
nose and chest.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Arsenicum is the
remedy for old, chronic catarrhal troubles of the nose where the
nose bleeds easily, and he is always sneezing and taking cold,
always chilly and pallid, tired, restless, full of anxiety in the
night and has troublesome dreams. The mucous membrane is easily
inflamed, producing patches of red and ulcers that bleed easily.
Great crusts form in the back of the nose. There is a striking
tendency to ulcerate in Arsenicum. If it is a sore throat it
ulcerates; if colds settle in the eyes, they may end in ulceration;
catarrhal troubles in the nose end in ulceration; and this
ulceration tendency, no matter where the trouble locates, is a very
strong feature of Arsenicum. It is the remedy for catarrhal
complaints of the nose and other places in broken down
constitutions from syphilis or malaria, or a constitution that has
gone through blood poisoning of some kind, either poisoning from a
dissecting wound, or from erysipelas or typhoid fever or other
zymotic states improperly treated, or poisoning with quinine and
like substances that break down the blood and establish a state of
anaemia. If an ulcer comes upon the leg, if a leucorrhoea comes on,
if any discharge is established the patient is relieved thereby.
Now let some of these discharges slack up and you have a chronic
state apparently from retained secretions, but it is a form of
blood poisoning. So it is with suppressed ear discharges,
suppressed throat discharges, suppressed leucorrhoea and
ulcerations. Arsenicum is one of the medicines that will conform to
the anaemic state that follows each suppression. At the present day
it is fashionable to use the cautery, to make local applications to
stop leucorrhoea and other discharges and to heal up ulcers. Now,
when these external troubles go there is an anaemic state
established in the economy, the patient becomes waxy and pallid,
sickly looking, and these catarrhal discharges come on as a means
of relief because of the suppression of some other condition. For
instance, since the suppression of a leucorrhoea the woman has had
thick, bloody or watery discharge from the nose. It is frequently
suitable to the constitution when an ulcer has been dried up by
salves, or an old ear discharge has been stopped by the outward
application of powders. The doctor thinks he has done a clever
thing in stopping such discharges, but he has only succeeded in
damming up the secretions which are really a relief to the patient.
Such medicines as SULPHUR, CALC. and Arsenicum are suitable for the
catarrhal discharges that come from these suppressions, in broken
down constitutions. Arsenic is also like unto the condition that
has been brought about from the absorption of animal poisons. It
goes to the very root of the evil, as it is similar to the symptoms
brought on from a dissecting wound. Arsenicum and LACHESIS are
medicines that will go to the cause at once and antidote the
poison, establishing harmony and turning things into
order.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The nose symptoms,
then, of Arsenic are very troublesome and furnish an extensive part
of the symptom image of an Arsenicum patient. They always take cold
easily, are always sensitive to cold and the catarrh is always
roused up on the slightest provocation. When an Arsenicum patient
is at his best he has discharge more or less of a thick character,
but when he takes a little cold it becomes thin; the thick
discharge that is necessary to his comfort slacks up, and then he
gets headache and on comes thirst, restlessness, anxiety and
distress. This goes on to a catarrhal fever of two or three days
duration, and then the thick discharge starts up again and he feels
better; all his pains and aches disappear. It has been of great
service in epithelioma of nose and lips.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Inflammation of the
throat and tonsils with burning increased by cold and better by
warm drinks. There is redness and a shrivelled condition of the
mucous membrane. When there is blood poisoning going on, as in
diphtheria, an exudate appears upon the mucous membrane and it
becomes gray and shrivelled, ashy colored, and this sometimes
covers the whole of the soft palate and the arches. It looks
withered. He is prostrated, anxious, sinking, weak, not a great
deal of fever, but much dryness of the mouth.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The catarrhal state
goes down into the larynx with hoarseness, and into the trachea
with burning, worse from coughing, and then comes constriction of
the chest, asthmatic dyspnoea and dry, hacking cough with no
expectoration. This teasing cough is attended with anxiety,
prostration, restlessness, exhaustion and sweat, and the cough does
not seem to do any good. The cough is the early part of it and
keeps on as a dry, rasping, harsh cough for several days without
doing any good; and then asthmatic symptoms come on, when he
expectorates great quantities of thin, watery sputum. There is
constriction about the chest, a great sense of tightness and
wheezing, and he feels he will suffocate. Bloody mucus is
expectorated at times, but the symptoms are more generally of a
catarrhal character. Symptoms of pneumonia sometimes appear with
the rusty expectoration. The expectoration is excoriating. There is
in the chest a sense of burning, as if coals of fire were in the
chest, and it goes on to bleeding and liver-colored
expectoration.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Arsenicum is a
bleeding medicine, one that predisposes to haemorrhagia, and
bleeding takes place from all mucous membranes; commonly of bright
red blood, but in this region the parts take on a gangrenous state
and the haemorrhagia become black and there are little clots like
portions of liver. The same are found in the vomited matter and in
the stools. The expectoration is horribly offensive, so much so
that you soon get the idea that there is a state of gangrene. The
patient is at this time going into a state that perhaps cannot be
any better described than a gangrenous inflammation; there will be
signs to indicate the inflammatory condition, and there will be the
smell of the expectoration which you will detect as soon as you
open the door. The expectoration is a thin, watery fluid
intermingled with clots. In the pan you will find this watery
expectoration looking like prune juice, and in the midst of it will
be clots of blood; the offensiveness is horrible. He has gone
through the period of restlessness and is now prostrated, sinking,
pallid, and likely enough covered with a cold sweat.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">When we come to the
stomach we find everything that may be called gastritis, vomiting
of everything taken, even a teaspoonful of water, extreme
irritation of the stomach, great prostration, horrible anxiety; dry
mouth; a very little hot water will sometimes comfort him for a
minute, but soon it must come up; cold fluids are vomited
immediately. The whole oesophagus is in a state of inflammation;
everything burns that comes up or goes down. Vomiting of bile and
blood. Extreme sensitiveness of the stomach is present; he does not
want to be touched. Heat applied externally relieves, and there is
a temporary relief from warm drinks; the heat is grateful. In the
bowels we have much trouble; this remedy has all the symptoms of
peritonitis; distension of the abdomen, a tympanitic state; cannot
be handled or touched, yet he will keep moving because he is so
restless, he cannot keep still, but finally he becomes so weak that
exhaustion takes the place of restlessness. Dysentery is likely to
come on, with involuntary passages of urine and fasces, one or
both, with haemorrhagia from the bowels and bloody urine. As the
bowels move, we get the cadaveric odor to the stool, a smell like
putrid flesh. The stool is bloody, watery, brown like prune juice,
or black and horribly offensive. Sometimes dysenteric in character
with dreadful straining and burning of the anus; every stool burns
as though there were coals of fire in the rectum; burning in the
bowels, burning all the way through. The pain in the abdomen is
better from the application of hot things. The tympanitic condition
is extreme. Sometimes there is a gastro-enteritis that takes on a
gangrenous character that in olden times used to be talked about as
gangrene of the bowel, a mortification that always ended in death.
A thick, bloody discharge is passed with a horrible odor, all
substances are vomited, the patient desires to be in a very warm
room, wants to be well covered, wants hot applications and warm
drinks, looks cadaveric and smells cadaveric, with a dry, pungent
odor that penetrates everything, but if he wants the covers off,
wants a cool room and windows open, wants to be sponged with cold
water, and wants ice cold drinks then he must have
SECALE.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">I want to warn you
against the too promiscuous use of Arsenic in the summer complaints
of young babies, for dysentery and cholera infantum. It has so many
little symptoms that are so common to these complaints that if you
do not look out and are not warned you will be likely to give your
patient Arsenic, suppress some of the symptoms, changing the aspect
of the case so that you cannot find a remedy for it and yet not
cure the case with Arsenic. There is a strong tendency to be
routine and give Arsenic without a sufficient number of generals
being present; i.e., if you give it on particulars and not on the
generals of the case.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This medicine is
full of diarrhoea and dysenteric symptoms; in these conditions
there will be the pallor, the anxiety, the cadaveric aspect and the
cadaveric odors. In the dysentery there is most distressing and
frequent urging to stool, scanty, slimy, black, fluid, inky stools
with cadaveric smell, great prostration, restlessness and pallor.
In the bowel troubles, in low forms of disease, the stool becomes
involuntary. This is a condition of the rectum, a relaxation of the
rectum, great prostration. Involuntary stool generally indicates
either local or general exhaustion, and in this remedy there is
terrible exhaustion, so that there is involuntary diarrhoea in
typhoid and in low forms of zymotic disease; involuntary
urine.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Purging is sometimes
present in Arsenic, but generally he does not have much purging,
such as we find in PODO., PHOS. AC. Usually there will be little,
frequent gushes, little spurts with flatus and the great exhaustion
that occurs in cholera, little spurts with mucus, slimy, whitish
stools. Arsenic is not so commonly indicated in cholera, i.e.,
during the gushing period, but sometimes after the gushing is over
and the vomiting and purging have passed, leaving a state of
extreme exhaustion, we have a state that appears like coma, the
patient looks almost as if dead, except that he breathes. We find,
then, that Arsenicum will establish reaction. Cholera infantum with
great prostration, sinking and cadaveric appearance, great
coldness, covered with cold sweat, cold extremities, cold as death;
cadaveric, sickly, foul, pungent, penetrating odor in the room from
the faeces and urine and even of what is vomited. The passages from
the bowels are acrid, excoriating, causing redness and burning.
Very often the burning extends into the bowels. The rectum and anus
burn, smarting all about the anus. It has tenesmus, painful,
unbearable urging, great distress in the lower bowel, in rectum and
anus, terrible state of anxiety of the patient and the pain is so
violent and the suffering so intense, the anguish so intense, that
he can think of nothing but death; the fearfulness and frightful
feelings are such as he has never experienced in his life, and he
feels confident these mean he is going to die. This, like all other
complaints, is attended with restlessness, and when not at stool he
is walking the floor, going from bed to chair and from chair to
bed. He will get on the stool and then back to bed, then he is
hurried to stool again, sometimes he loses it. Sometimes there is a
chronic haemorrhoidal state with burning, and the haemorrhoids
protrude when at stool, he is much exhausted after getting back
into bed after a stool, with these protruding lumps which are like
grapes and feel like coals of fire. They are hot, dry and bleeding.
Fissures of the rectum that bleed at every stool, with burning
itching and eczematous eruptions about the anus with
burning</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This kind of pain
may be felt anywhere in the body; burning is characteristic of
Arsenic, stitching is characteristic of Arsenic. Now, put these
together and the patient often describes it as being stuck with red
hot needles all over him. This red hot sensation, which is a common
feature all over, is felt at the anus, and especially when there
are haemorrhoids, burning and sticking like hot needles in the
haemorrhoids.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">At times when a
patient is coming down with the early stage of a violent attack he
will have all the rigor and chill that it is possible to find in
the Materia Medica and that can be found in disease. Rigors and
chills of violent character, and at such times he describes a
feeling as if the blood flowing through the vessels were ice water.
He feels a rushing through the body of ice cold waves. When the
fever comes on and he is intensely hot from head to foot, before
the sweat has appeared, he feels that boiling water is going
through the blood vessels. Then comes on the sweat and dyspnoea and
all complaints in which he is prostrated and becomes cold. While
the sweat sometimes relieves the fever and pains, yet it is
prolonged and attended with great exhaustion and does not relieve
his exhaustion. Many of his complaints are increased with the
sweat; for instance, thirst is increased, the drinking is copious
and does not relieve, it seems he cannot get enough and patients
will say: "I can drink the well dry," or "Give me a bucket of
water." Such things are indicative of the state of thirst. During
the fever he wants little and often; during the chill he wants hot
drinks.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Arsenicum is a very
useful medicine in the eruptions of the genitals with burning. In
little ulcers that burn, even when they are syphilitic; herpetic
vesicles that appear upon the foreskin and upon the labia; chancre
or chancroid with burning, smarting and stinging, but especially in
those that are weak, that offer no willingness to heal, but that do
the very opposite, that spread, those that we call phagedenic,
those that eat from their outer margins, become larger and larger.
Arsenicum and MERC-C. are the two principal medicines for spreading
ulcerations such as eat in every direction, very offensive. Such
ulcerations as follow the opening of a bubo in the inguinal region
where there is no tendency to heal. A little, watery, offensive
discharge keeps coming and extending, ulceration keeps spreading
round about the opening, no tendency to heal. Or the patient has
been in the hands of a surgeon who has passed his knife down the
threatening suppurating bubo and it has been followed by red,
angry, erysipelatous appearance and shows no tendency to heal. The
edges have been removed by ulceration, and now the surface has
cleared off, leaving a surface the size of a dollar; sometimes
becoming serpiginous. These ulcers are sensitive to touch and burn
like fire.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the male and
female sexual organs there are many symptoms of importance. In the
male organs a dropsical condition, dropsy of the penis, oedematous
appearance, so that the penis is enormously swollen and looks like
a water bag; the scrotum, especially the skin of the scrotum,
greatly swollen and humid round about the parts. In the female the
labia are enormously swollen with burning, stinging pains, hard and
swollen. Erysipelatous inflammation of these organs, ulcerations of
a syphilitic character; these when such symptoms as burning,
smarting and stinging are present. In the female, violent, burning
pains in the genitals with or without swelling, burning that
extends up into the vagina, with great dryness and itching of the
vagina. The leucorrhoeal discharge excoriates the parts, causing
itching and burning with great suffering. Whitish, watery, thin
discharges that excoriate; so copious sometimes that it will run
down the thighs. The Arsenicum menstrual flow is very often
excoriating in character. Copious leucorrhoeal flow intermixed with
menstrual flow, very profuse and very acrid. Suppressed
menstruation going on for months; amenorrhoea in prostrated,
nervous patients, wrinkled, careworn, haggard faces.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Of course, Arsenic
has a wonderful reputation in the old school for anaemia, and it is
said to be as good as FERR. for anaemia; FERR. and Ars. are the
strong drugs for anaemia, so that it is not to be wondered at that
these pallid mortals find benefit from Arsenicum. "During
menstruation, stitches in the rectum." "Leucorrhoea acrid,
corroding, thick and yellow," etc.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">After parturition
the woman does not pass the urine; no urine in the bladder;
suppression, or the bladder is full and it does not pass. In
connection with this subject you will find CAUST. the most
frequently indicated remedy when you go back, and the woman has not
passed the urine and it is time that she should; you will
frequently find it indicated when you have no other symptoms to go
on. ACON. will be more frequently indicated than any other remedy
if the infant has not passed the urine. This is keynote practice
and is to be condemned when there are other symptoms to indicate a
remedy. If there are no other symptoms study ACON. and CAUST. and
see if there is any reason why they should not be given. Another
feature in connection with the woman, Arsenic is a wonderful
palliative in cancerous affections, such as occur in the uterus and
mammary glands. Burning, stinging pains have entirely disappeared,
in incurable cases, of course. It becomes one of the
palliatives.</span></p>

voice, laryngitis, with dry teasing cough; a cough that does not
seem to do any good; hacking constantly, dry, hacking cough. Study
its relation to asthma and difficult breathing, dyspnoea. Arsenic
has cured some long-standing cases of asthma of a nervous
character; asthma that comes on after midnight, in patients who
suffer from the cold, those who are very pallid, dry wheezing
cough, must sit up in bed and hold the chest, anxious restlessness
with prostration.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The heart symptoms
are troublesome to manage when they get to be like Arsenic; the
symptoms correspond to a state of great weakness, great
palpitation, palpitation from the least exertion or excitement,
great anxiety, anguish, weakness; he cannot walk, he cannot go
upstairs, he can hardly move without increasing the palpitation;
every excitement brings on palpitation. "Severe paroxysms of
palpitation or attacks of syncope during endocarditis." Arsenicum
corresponds to most serious complaints of the heart, corresponds to
many of the incurable complaints of the heart; i.e., when you see
Arsenic corresponding in all of the symptoms with these marked
cardiac affections, dropsy of the pericardium, etc., you have a
class of cases that are very serious, "Angina pectoris," etc.
"Rheumatism affecting the heart," etc. "Hydropericardium with great
irritability," etc. "Pulse frequent, small, trembling." "Pulsation
through whole body," etc., etc. Again this goes on to another state
when the heart becomes weak, pulse thread-like, patient pale and
cold, covered with sweat, pulse very feeble. When this is not a
state of the heart itself then Arsenic becomes a wonderful remedy;
that is, it is capable of cure.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">I want to say a few
things concerning a few essentials, some few things most general to
the Arsenicum type of intermittent. You can read the general state
of intermittent fever and fevers generally and apply what has been
said. Arsenic has all the violence of the chill that you can find
in any remedy, with excitement, headache, prostration, dry mouth,
desire for hot drinks and to be covered up warmly, with all the
anxious restlessness and prostration that you can find in any
medicine; but the time of the Arsenic case is an important thing. A
striking feature of the Arsenic time of chill is its irregularity,
coming not twice alike, coming at any time. It has afternoon chill
and after midnight chill, sometimes in the morning, sometimes at 3
or 4 p.m., sometimes at 1 p.m. It has a striking periodicity in its
nature. Hence it has an intermittent nature. It has a striking
feature of thirst. During the chill, while there is sometimes great
thirst, he has aversion to cold things, hence can take only hot
drinks, hot teas, etc. During the fever the thirst increases
because he has dry mouth, and he drinks little and often, just a
teaspoonful to wet his dry mouth. Water does not quench his thirst,
for he wants but a tablespoonful, little and often. This runs on
into the sweat with prostration, increased coldness, desire for
copious drinks, and unquenchable thirst for cold drinks. The chill
is attended with great aching in the bones, likely to commence in
the extremities, and during the chill there is a great head
congestion with purple fingers and toes. Put these things together
and the prostration that occurs with the awful anxiety and you can
most always in a general way pick out the Arsenic case. But it has
so many details in its chill, fever and sweat that if you take the
details of symptoms and leave these general features out you will
be likely to be able to cover almost any case of chills, i.e., you
may think you will, but unless some of these general states are
present that stamp it as Ars. you will fail. It is one thing to
stamp the whole case as Ars. and another thing to say that these
are Arsenicum symptoms. So it is with CHIN. and QUININE; they have
numerous particular symptoms, and yet to make the case a CHIN. or
QUININE case the striking general features must be
present.</span></p>
