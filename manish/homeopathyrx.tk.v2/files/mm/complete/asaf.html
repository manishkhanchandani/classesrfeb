<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">ASAFOETIDA</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Asaf.)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This remedy in olden
times was frequently abused for man and beast. Our grandfathers
supposed it was a protection against disease, and hence they used
it in the stables. Lumps of "foety," as they called it were put in
the corn for the horse, to keep off distemper. What it has
accomplished I am unable to say, but it is certain that these
farmers looked upon Asafoetida as a great protective against
disease. It has been used also by the laity as a medicine for
fainting, for hysteria, and all sorts of nervous symptoms and
complaints. The use is justified by the proving. These things are
scarcely worthy of note, but it shows the general use among the
people, as a domestic medicine, in crude form. It has been used
more extensively in this form than in professional practice in a
legitimate way.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There is one class
of patients you will find who will trouble you. Those cases that
come into your office with puffed, venous, purple faces; they have
an appearance of plethora; the face looks puffed, bloated and
dropsical at times; it is a dark red, dusky face; such a face we
shall cure sometimes with Asafoetida. CARBO-AN., AUR., CARB-V. and
PULSATILLA are also related to this kind of face, but it is a very
troublesome face, it shows more or less cardiac disturbance and
venous stasis. The venous side of the heart will often be involved,
or be about to be involved, when you have this kind of face. I
never like to see them come into my office, for they are hard cases
to manage. They have deep-seated troubles, with bleeding, they are
subject to sudden inflammations, and they do not rally quickly. In
this constitution, we have ulcerations; a little place will
ulcerate and suppurate, and the ulceration will burrow; this is
just what this remedy does. Another thing this kind of constitution
will do is to set up an inflammatory condition of the periosteum
with swelling, periostitis of the tibia for instance, where the
circulation is not very active; inflammation of cartilages with
tumefaction and purple skin, stitching pains and dropsy,
ulcerations and fistulous openings. This medicine is good for just
such states. "Ulcers with extreme sensitiveness."</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Patients often say,
"I get no sympathy when I am sick because I look so well;" fat,
flabby and purple. This remedy will seldom be thought of in lean
persons; they seem to be free from complaints like those of
Asafoetida, but in fat, flabby persons, extremely nervous,
extremely sensitive to pain, full of hysteria. Purple when out in
the cold, purple when excited. In other words, you see before you
the venous constitution, and these people get the worst kind of
hysteria; they go off almost from no cause into fainting; from a
close room, from excitement, from any disturbance; sometimes cramps
come on, but more especially fainting. They are subject to
stitching pains from the bone to the surface; that is, from within
out. The periosteum becomes irritated, and glands become swollen.
Syphilis sometimes produces this kind of condition. Vascular
disturbances in the body; periostitis, necrosis, induration of
glands, nerve syphilis and head pains. In old syphilitics with this
kind of venous face, subject to bleeding, ulcers turn black or
become purple. In this, there is a similarity to LACHESIS. Old
scars turn purple, threaten to suppurate, take on a venous aspect,
become painful and turn black. Ulcers form at the site of old scars
in old syphilitic patients and sometimes in psoric patients. Most
complaints come on during rest and are better by slow motion
(PULS).</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There is another
grand feature running through this remedy; it is full of
discharges, catarrhal discharges, discharges from ulcers, watery
discharges from different places, and even watery stool; and all
these discharges are horribly offensive and ichorous. Deep, flat
ulcers from bone and periosteal affections give out a watery,
bloody discharge that is horribly offensive, with pains shooting
outwards. Get the idea of the venous stasis well fixed in your mind
and with this syphilitic state added to it.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There are many pains
running through the remedy and they are night pains like those of
syphilis, nightly bone pains, and pains in the periosteum. The
ulcers are deep, with bluish edges. Varicose veins surround the
ulcers. Inflammation of the bone and periosteum, with blueness all
around the ulcers. When there has been an inflammatory condition of
the periosteum, somewhat passive in character, the skin adheres to
the bone, glues down to it by adhesion. It is too feeble to
ulcerate; it does not get up a likely inflammation, but only a
passive state. The glands all over the body are hot and throbbing,
with shooting, jerking pains, in syphilis or old psoric and
scrofulous complaints.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The bone pains that
are felt in the head are sometimes very distressing. Old syphilitic
bone pains in the head, stitching, penetrating. It seems where
there are lumps and nodules, about the head; this medicine seems to
hurry things. Shooting, stitching, tearing pains under left frontal
eminence. This stitching pain is sometimes described as if a nail
or plug were driven into the head. These nervous headaches are
syphilitic, hysterical or scrofulous; hysterical pains described as
rending, tearing, stitching. All over the head there is stitching
pain, but in the frontal eminence, in the temples, there is a
sensation as if a nail or plug were driven in, and most of the
pains seem to bore, as if they extended from the bone to the
surface, and hence are said to be from within out.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE-VISION</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It is useful in old
syphilitics who are subject to eye complaints, ulcers on the
eyeball, ulcers on the cornea, ameliorated in the open air, with a
sensation of numbness in the eyes; inflammation of the iris, with
ragged appearance of the iris; they are subject also to severe,
sharp stitching pains that come from within out. The remedy is full
of burning, and so the eyeballs burn, better in the open air.
Iritis, but the inflammation sometimes involves the choroid, the
retina, and mucous membrane, making a general inflammatory
condition of syphilitic character. There are tearing pains in
various places around the eyes; sticking, stitching pains, worse at
night. Ulcers, with stitching pains, worse at night. Burning,
stitching in the eyes with dryness, so that the lids stick to the
balls of the eyes, pain worse at night. There is a misty appearance
before the eyes, dullness as if looking through a fog. It also
seems as if the atmosphere were filled with little floating black
flies. "Muscae voliantes." You have looked into the air and seen
little gnats and mosquitoes; well it appears to these patients as
if these were there when they are not there. The discharge from the
eyes is ichorous, bloody and often offensive.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EAR-HEARING</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This same syphilitic
miasm may attack the ear and the bones of the ear. These bones may
decay and the hearing be lost. "Burning in the ear with discharge
of foetid pus." Stitching pains in the EARS FROM WITHIN
OUT.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A horribly offensive
discharge comes from the nose; ulcers high up in the nose; caries
of the bones of the nose; syphilitic ozaena. Putrid old catarrhs.
"Feeling as if the nose stopped high up, as if he could not breathe
through it, with fulness of the head, when riding in a
carriage."(AUR., AUR.-M.)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Numbness is a great
feature of this remedy, numbness of the scalp, or deep in the head;
numbness here and there; numb, dead feeling associated with the
pain; numbness after pain; often numbness after sleep. Other
nervous manifestations occur besides those that are hysterical. It
has choreic motions. You would expect such a peculiar nervous
constitution to have almost everything among its nervous symptoms.
"Constantly chewing and working frothy slime out of mouth, with
swollen tongue." "Speech unintelligible." "Grinding of teeth;
starting at night." Swelling of the lips, and of the whole buccal
mucous membrane, especially the lower lip, with burning in the
mouth.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">THROAT</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There are syphilitic
symptoms in the throat, attended with the usual burning, darting,
stitching in ulcers; pain when swallowing; a sensation of a ball
rising in the throat, such as occurs in globus hystericus; choking,
must constantly swallow. Hysterical and choreic affections of the
oesophagus and trachea. Spasms of the oesophagus. This lump in the
throat, or suffocation, is a sort of hysterical spasm of the
oesophagus. "Dryness and burning in the oesophagus."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOMACH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the stomach
troubles, if you have ever seen a typical case of Asafoetida, you
will wonder where all the air comes from; it comes up in volumes.
"Hiccough-like contractions of the diaphragm." Choreic jerkings of
the diaphragm, with expulsion of wind like the sound of a pop-gun
going off almost every second. It is a condition that the patient
has no control over. It is like the shooting off, of little guns
forcing loud belching, loud eructations of wind from the stomach.
There are a few symptoms mentioned in the text just here that are
worthy of note. "Pulsation in pit of stomach; perceptible to sight
and touch." "Pressing, cutting, stitching pains." A queer
observation has been made that flatus was not passed downward, but
all upwards. "Eructations; smelling like garlic; tasting rancid,
sharp or putrid." Always horribly offensive. Offensiveness is a
characteristic of the remedy. And then there is a "gone empty
feeling in the pit of the stomach," not a pain. "Pulsations after
eating." "Meteorism of the stomach." The remedy has many gastric
and abdominal complaints; full of bellyache; stitching pains,
colic. The diarrhoea is more or less troublesome. These patients
are afflicted with diarrhoea from the slightest indigestion, after
any indiscretion in diet, a painful, watery diarrhoea. "Liquid
stools of most disgusting smell." "Blackish-brown papescent
offensive stools, which relieve."</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-FEMALE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Bearing down in
genitals, worse when riding in a carriage." "Uterine ulcer
sensitive and painful." This medicine has been very useful in
palliating uterine cancer in such constitutions as described; those
with purple faces, never the very pallid ones. Women of feeble,
flabby, venous constitutions are subject to haemorrhages and
miscarriages. Women who are not pregnant sometimes have the breasts
fill up with milk, a wonderfully annoying thing, and but few
remedies have it; this is one of the few. It has also deficiency of
milk. "Ten days after delivery milk diminished."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">RESPIRATION-CHEST</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">These patients
sometimes get hysterical asthma; all sorts of disturbance in
breathing, dyspnoea. "Asthmatic feeling in trachea." "Asthmatic
attacks at least once a day all her life, brought on by every
bodily exertion, coition, especially by every satisfying meal."
Attacks of dyspnoea after coition, like AMBR. "Obstinate
titillating cough &lt; at night." Many of these complaints are
worse at night; nightly aggravations. Syphilitic complaints are
commonly worse at night and such antisyphilitic remedies as MERC.,
STAPHISAGRIA, HEP., NITRIC ACID, etc., are all worse at night.
Among the other chest complaints, I will read a few of those that
are marked here prominently and are striking ones. "Pressure and
burning of the sternum." "Compression of chest as from a heavy
weight." "Stitches in chest." "Single, violent stitches from within
outward, at short intervals."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">CHEST</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This remedy is full
of rheumatism and gouty symptoms; gouty affections in general, in
nervous constitutions. When such a nervous constitution finally
produces gouty formations, the nervousness often disappears; for it
has been relieved by the deposit in the joints; a transformation
scene has taken place.</span></p>
