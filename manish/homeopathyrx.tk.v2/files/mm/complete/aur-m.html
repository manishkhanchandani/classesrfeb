<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">AURUM
MURIATICUM</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Aur-m.)</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This remedy
exercises a profound action upon the mind and body. The patients
suffering from latent syphilis are over-sensitive to it, and often
require it in their complaints. It has many bone symptoms and pains
and they are worse at night. Its catarrhal condition is very much
like that found in old cases of syphilis, such as had long
treatment with MERC. and IODIDES. It is a rheumatic constitution
also and is useful in acute and chronic rheumatism. It has cured
rheumatic fever where the joints have been mostly affected but are
now better and the heart is the principal seat of suffering. Many
complaints are associated with cardiac disease. Dropsical states
from heart disease, from liver affections, with albumin in the
urine after scarlet fever or with intermittent fever. Where old
syphilitics continue to lose flesh. The glands and parts inflamed
become indurated. It has been useful in cancerous glands.
Inflammation of the bone and periosteum; caries, exostosis after
MERCURY in latent syphilis. Caries of the joints with nightly
boring and gnawing pains. It has BURNING PAINS IN MANY PARTS. The
pains are tearing, drawing, pressing and stitching. Many symptoms
come on during rest and some during motion. Cold, wet weather
ameliorates. Warm air, warm bed, warm room, warm wraps, becoming
warm even in open air, and warmth in general aggravates the general
feeling. Exertion and walking increase many symptoms. The
palpitation, suffocation and great weakness come from walking and
exertion. While open air ameliorates he is even in the open air
incapable of exertion. Fast walking is impossible. The nervous
symptoms are very marked. Excitement, sensitive to noise, starting
when spoken to, starting in sleep. When the above symptoms are
concomitants of heart and liver diseases this remedy will most
likely be useful. Fullness of the veins all over the body is a
strong feature of this remedy. It is a most useful remedy in
patients suffering from the chronic effects of gonorrhoea and
syphilis, where fig warts and syphilitic ulceration are present
together.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The mental symptoms
are largely such as are found in Aurum. It has the same suicidal
disposition. His mind dwells upon his broken health until he
becomes low-spirited and desires death. He loathes his life.
Weeping and aversion to his occupation. INDOLENCE. The melancholia
of old syphilitics. Extremely anxious with palpitation.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Said to be "full of
whims and notions." Extremely irritable. Nothing can be done to
please him. Constant fretting. Extreme mental and physical
restlessness. He walks the streets slowly, to be in the open air,
which ameliorates; he is much worse in the house, and in the warm
room. Thinking about his complaint caused the heart to beat strong
and fast. Symptoms worse after fright, vexation and mortification.
When the general symptoms mentioned above strongly predominate, it
will cure the particulars in the various parts below.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It cures violent
syphilitic headaches with vertigo. Violent left-sided headaches.

forehead is hot. Heat of the head and cold extremities. Great
soreness of the periosteum and exostoses of the skull. Tearing
pains in the skull. Worse nights.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It cures chronic eye
troubles due to syphilis. The mucous membrane of the lids and ball
is red, thickened and very vascular. The lids stick together in the
morning. Dim vision in the evening by artificial light. Loss of
vision after syphilis, and after scarlet fever. Very slow
accommodation. Amaurosis, chronic inflammation of margin of lids.
Burning pain in the eyes.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It is one of the
most useful remedies for catarrh of the nose in patients who are
sensitive to the warm room. It classes with PULSATILLA and KALI
SULPHURICUM, as both of these are better in the open air. The
discharges of the remedy are thin or thick like pus, very offensive
and sometimes bloody, and there are many hard crusts in the nose.
Bleeding of the nose on blowing out of the crusts. Yellow, greenish
discharge. It cures the most stubborn syphilitic catarrh. The nasal
bones become sensitive to pressure. Caries of the bones of the
nose. Red, swollen nose. Deep cracks about the wings of the nose.

with snuffles and indented nose.</span></p>

gentle motion and we have a combination that this remedy often
cures. The pale face with red spot on each cheek is not that which
is found in consumption, but in heart complaint. The infant's face
looks old. Acne on the face. There is often a red, healthy look on
the face of very sickly people. Red faced from venous stasis; it is
a false plethora, like that described in AURUM. Caries of the lower
