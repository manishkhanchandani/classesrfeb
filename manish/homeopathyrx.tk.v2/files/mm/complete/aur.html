Like the victim of syphilis, mental states of great depression are produced by it. Hopeless, despondent, and GREAT DESIRE TO COMMIT SUICIDE. Every opportunity is sought for self-destruction. Exostosis, caries, nightly bone-pains, especially cranial, nasal, and palatine. Glands swollen in scrofulous subjects. Palpitation and congestions. Ascites often in conjunction with heart affections. Frequently indicated in secondary syphilis and effects of mercury. This use of gold as an anti-venereal and anti-scrofulous remedy is very old, but has been well-nigh forgotten by the old school until rediscovered and placed on its scientific basis by homeopathy, and now it can never be lost again. When syphilis is implanted on the scrofulous constitution, we have one of the most intractable morbid conditions, and gold seems to be especially suited to the vile combination. ENNUI.

<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">AURUM
METALLICUM</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Aur.)</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The general features
of the remedy are such as relate to the mind and such as relate to
the tissues of the body in general. If you run through the mental
symptoms, taking them all in as one great whole, you will see that
all the affections, natural to healthy man, are perverted. So great
in extent is this that one of the fundamental loves, which is the
love of living, of self-protection, is perverted and he loathes
life, is weary of life, longs to die and seeks methods to commit
suicide. No love of life. The affections pre-eminently are
deranged; the intellectual sphere is only secondarily changed. Of
course, insanity runs through the remedy, but it is an insanity
that begins in the will and proceeds to the intellect; it is first
observed as a perversion of the affections. It is astonishing that
one could get into such a state of mind, such horrible depression
of spirits that there is an absolute loss of enjoyment in
everything. You take away a man's hope, and he has nothing to live
for, he then wants to die. Such, it seems, is the state in this
medicine. Self-condemnation, continual self-reproach,
self-criticism, a constant looking into self; she does nothing
right, everything is wrong, nothing will succeed, hopelessness.
"Imagines he cannot succeed in anything, and he does everything
wrong; he is in disunion with himself." Imagines he sees obstacles
in his way everywhere. He is all the time imaging that he has
NEGLECTED SOMETHING, THAT HE HAS NEGLECTED HIS FRIENDS. He imagines
that he deserves reproach in consequence of HAVING NEGLECTED DUTY;
he has neglected something, he is wrong, is wholly evil, has sinned
away his day of grace, is not worthy of salvation; this is the
train of thought that constantly runs through his mind. The thought
really becomes uncontrollable; he is absorbed in himself and sits
and broods over it, and by brooding over it he only intensifies his
present state and hatches new grievances, continues to worry over
himself, thinks he is wholly unfit for this world, and then he
longs to die. He looks on the dark side of everything, constantly
expecting bad news, looking for everything to go wrong. The future
looks dark to him, and he wants to die; he never will succeed, for
everything goes wrong that he turns his hand to. His business is
dark, his family troubles him, his friends annoy him; he becomes
EXTREMELY irritable, easily angered, is worried over trifles, and
easily excited. Every little thing rouses him into anger and
turmoil, he is always in a vexation. The Aurum state of mind is an
insanity dreadful to look upon because of its turbulence and
melancholy. It is suitable in the most profound states of
melancholy and depression where the patient sits silent and says
nothing. When disturbed he is aroused to great vehemence, anger and
violence. "Melancholy, feels hateful and quarrelsome." "Terrible
melancholy after abuse of MERC." The causes of this state of
insanity are prolonged anxiety, unusual responsibility, syphilis
and loss of property. Persons who have been repeatedly drugged with
MERC., have established upon themselves a mercurial disease, with
enlargement of the liver, and this is almost always attended more
or less by melancholy and sadness and such hopelessness as we find
in Aurum. Aurum produces such affections of the liver as are
associated with cardiac affections, endocarditis, dropsy of the
heart and rheumatic affections that have gone to the heart. You
will notice that wherever the AFFECTIONS are pre-eminently
disturbed in mental disease that there is either cardiac weakness,
endocarditis, enlargement of the heart, or some organic or
functional disease of the heart. You will very often find a history
of taking MERC. that has superinduced a rheumatic state that has
been rubbed away with liniments until the heart is affected, and
with this comes hopelessness, insanity of the will, disturbance of
the affections. Then it appears to spread in this remedy from the
will to the understanding, and the intellectual portion of man
becomes involved. Think what a state it is for a man who has been
in good condition of health, respected in his business circles, to
have a desire to commit suicide. You will see other kinds of
insanity and a breaking down or a state of feebleness of the
intellect, he cannot think nor reason; his affections are
practically intact, but he finally goes into a state of imbecility,
or he becomes wild and commits suicide from impulse. That is an
instance where the intellect has been affected first and spread to
the will. Sometimes this state comes on, and no disturbance in the
man's intellectual nature has been observed; it is intact, it is
sound. He has been sound in his business affairs, he has been a
good father, he has been observed by those around him to be
intelligent, but he has silently brooded over his state and his
hatred of the world; he has told nobody of it, and then he has been
found hung in his room. The man's intellectual nature keeps the man
in contact with the world; but his affections are largely kept to
himself. A man can have affection for all sorts of things and
perversion of the affections, but his intellect will guide him not
to show his likes and dislikes to the world. The affections cannot
be seen, but man's intellect is subject to inspection. He cannot
conceal his intellect. We shall see that the affections are
interior, they are covered with a cloak, they are his innermost and
are hidden from inspection; but the understanding is the outermost
garment, it surrounds and hides his affections, just as does the
garment he wears over the body hide the body. The affections that
Aurum resembles are those like unto the very innermost nature of
man.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Ailments from
grief, disappointed love, fright, anger, contradiction,
mortification." "Pain makes her desperate so that she would like to
jump out of the window." He meditates upon death, upon suicide; he
wants to get out of the world, wants to destroy himself, has no
love for his life that he thinks is worthless.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">PHYSICAL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The remedy is full
of rheumatic affections, not unlike such as are found in old
mercurial cases; rheumatic affections with swelling of the joints;
affections of the cartilages and bone, inflammation of the
periosteum; thickening and induration of the periosteum.
Indurations of glands; induration of the cartilages about the
joints. These are all of syphilitic and mercurial character. It is
useful in old syphilitics when the bones are breaking down in any
part of the body; the shin bones, nose bones, ear bones, any of the
small bones. Like syphilis and mercury, the complaints are
aggravated at night, coming on in the evening and keep up all
night. The pains are violent, they tear, the bones ache as if they
would break, not in acute fevers but in old syphilitic bone
troubles. Knife-like pains in the periosteum. Pains in the joints
rendering them immovable. Inflammation of the bone itself with
caries. It is not strange that the vascular coating of the bones,
the periosteum, should be greatly affected because there is a
strange vascularity, all over the economy, in this medicine. The
veins are enlarged, in a state of congestion and inflammation, and
friable. The veins become thickened and tumefied. The blood vessels
pulsate all over the body. "Erethism or vascular fulness
characterizes nearly all complaints." Fulness of the veins of the
extremities; this goes on until swelling appears with weakness so
that dropsy is prevalent throughout the remedy. Oedema of the
extremities, with pitting upon pressure, which occurs in heart and
liver affections. A false state of plethora seems to exist in the
body and finally turmoil and excitement occur. Violent orgasms in
the body, sometimes demonstrated as violent heat, coming in flushes
with excitement. Fidgetiness, feeling as if something dreadful was
going to happen throughout the economy. Then it settles into a
state of quiescence for a while and then this repeats itself. These
violent orgasms come preparatory to the localization or
establishment of some breakdown in the economy. At times it is a
cardiac affection, with marked oppression behind the sternum with
dyspnoea on walking fast or going upstairs. Endocarditis will have
this turmoil in the body; by and by look for albumin in the urine,
look for enlargement of the liver, look for signs of cancer of the
uterus, and deep-seated affections.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Boring in bones."
"Pains drive to despair." The pains drive the patient out of bed at
night and make him walk. This is seen in old syphilitic bone pains,
and old mercurialized patients. The patient has been taking MERC.
all his life and his liver are enlarged, and his joints are
enlarged. He goes to every doctor, with an endeavor to get relief
from his distressing sufferings. MERC. and disease are so mixed up
that a great turmoil will result from your first prescription. He
will go through these stages of violence and periodical attacks.
You will have to know such medicines as Aurum, CHEL. and
STAPHISAGRIA to get this patient over these awful attacks, which he
is, obliged to go through.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This medicine
wonderfully affects the glands, the parotid glands, the glands
about the groin, the lymphatics in the abdomen; in fact, the glands
everywhere. The mammary glands, the testes and ovaries, are
involved, and undergo states of hardness, infiltration, etc. Aurum
cures chronic enlargement of the testes, and lumps in the mammary
glands. Tumors in these glands, of cystic character, have been
cured by Aurum. Hahnemann potentized Aurum and gave some of it to a
patient, and it did not work, but he thoroughly triturated it until
he got it to the fifteenth potency and then it worked and restored
that patient to the bosom of his family. Hahnemann says that in the
earlier triturations the dose was yet too large to cure; so he went
higher until it was sufficiently small to cure, sufficiently
attenuated to go into the interior of the economy through the
various envelopes of man.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There is one grand
feature running through the Aurum state; it is the manner in which
he is affected by temperature, and by the weather. Here are some
symptoms that relate to the whole man, which must be examined in
this connection. "Desire for open air." This patient ranks along
with PULSATILLA as to temperature; but Aurum is not mild, gentle
and yielding, he is obstinate, irascible, the very opposite of the
PULSATILLA patient. "Generally &gt; growing warm." This is in
connection with the headaches. "Cold water ameliorates pain in
eyes." "Averse to uncover," but he desires open air like
PULSATILLA. "Warm air, asthma &lt;". Many symptoms disappear after
washing, especially cold washing; but whenever the patient is
suffering from great excitement, turmoil and vascularity,
constitutional orgasm, pulsations, he wants the doors and windows
open, wants to get out in the cool air; wants the clothing thrown
off. This state of excitement and pulsation is ameliorated by the
open air. It has those flushes of heat so common to women at the
critical period, and these are followed by sweat, sometimes by
chilliness.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Most that we have
said of the remedy is about its general aspect, for everything
about the mind is general.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In Aurum the pain in
the head is very intense, maddening, often accompanied by a
sensation as if air were blowing upon him; he looks around to see
where the draft comes from when there is none; extremely sensitive.
Often has to have the head wrapped up, although it feels hot, with
a good deal of congestion and rush of blood to the head. The head
is sore and feels bruised. Stitching, burning, tearing pains in the
head; much throbbing in the head. The face is bloated, flushed and
shiny with the congestive headaches. These headaches are often
found in syphilitic subjects; often associated with cardiac
disease. Pain in the back of the head associated with cardiac
disease, with sluggish circulation, purple face, and duskiness of
the skin. Exostoses as in syphilis. The skull bones are sensitive
to touch; the periosteum is tender to touch. In old mercurialized
cases with bone affections and necrosis of the skull, as in
syphilis and mercury, the hair falls out copiously; the head
becomes bald. Baldness due to syphilis; the scalp is left shiny and
the hair will not grow in again. In acute diseases, there is
falling out of the hair, but it grows in again. But young
syphilitics often lose the hair and remain bald all the rest of
their life.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE
-VISION</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There are
disturbances of the eye, of a catarrhal character, even to the
extent of ulceration and infiltration of the various coatings of
the eye. Iritis; great disturbance of the whole visual apparatus;
some of the striking features I will read from the book, but
remember the constitution that we must always have in view;
remember the mental state, the mercurial and syphilitic states, the
gouty tendency, and the complaints that belong to joints, remember
the cardiac disturbances. As we review the eye symptoms, we thus
see the constitution with which they are likely to be associated.
"Photophobia." Weak sight and eyes. "By gaslight a number of
bright, floating specks and dots are seen." "Eyes ameliorated by
moonlight." "Large letters cannot be distinguished." "Yellow,
crescent-shaped bodies floating obliquely upward in field of
vision." "In upper dark section of field of vision occasional
showers of bright, star-like bodies." In CALC. there is a queer
symptom; he sees a sudden flash arise from the lower portion of the
field of vision; it shoots up and divides, and then he sees stars
in every direction. It is the appearance you will see sometimes in
the shooting off one of those rockets that explode and come down in
a shower. That has been observed in CALC. "Hemiopia of the left
eye." And so it goes on with many of these peculiar things that can
hardly be described except in the language of the text. "Protruding
eyes." Protrusion of the eyes, such as occurs in exophthalmic
goitre, with enlargement of the heart, has been cured by Aurum.
Enlargement of the thyroid gland with rapid and full pulse.
Exophthalmic goitre has been cured by Aurum, NAT-M. "Staring,
dreary look." "Iritis marked by much pain around eye, which seems
to be deep in bone." Such a state would be likely to be produced by
syphilis that had been treated with MERC. and Aurum would come in
as an antidote to both the syphilis and the MERC. "Pupils
irregularly dilated." It has catarrhal states of the eye. It has
inflammation of the conjunctiva, choroid, iris and retina. Well,
syphilis does this, taking hold of the eye in just this way and
causing great infiltration. Pains round about the eye; the thin
plate bones, and the skull bones are all sensitive to pressure; the
bones seem tender; periostitis; opacity of the cornea.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EAR</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Syphilis often takes
hold of the ear, affecting the bones of that organ. "Caries of
mastoid process, obstinate otorrhoea." Caries of the bones of the
ear. "Parotids swollen, painful to touch." "Oversensitiveness to
noises; but music relieves." "Humming, buzzing and rushing in
ears." Rushing like the rushing of wind and falling water.
"Annoying dryness in ears and nose." This is all like the
complaints of syphilis, which are cured by Aurum, but Aurum also
corresponds to and has cured many times otorrhoea following scarlet
fever where there is even entire loss of the drum of the ear and
loss of the bones. Of course it does not restore hearing. Patients
will come to you for ear troubles, and you may find that the whole
ear apparatus is destroyed; the mucous membrane and bones of the
ear are all in a state of ulceration and necrosis and the discharge
is foetid. The patient consults you in order to have the hearing
restored and it may not be possible; stop that ear discharge and
restore the hearing are the only two things he thinks about. If you
go today to our ear specialists and speak about curing the patient,
they would not know what you were talking about; the only thing
that would be thought of would be the stopping of that ear
discharge as quickly as possible. They would examine the ear to see
whether it is intact or not; and if it is not, the hearing is of
course gone and the stopping of the discharge is then all that is
taken into consideration. Homeopathy teaches that the PATIENT
should be treated and the patient only, after which the organs and
tissues become normal. The whole duty of the physician is to
restore health to the patient. We have the nose specialists with
their local applications. These things will only bring on bone
disease, and tubercular troubles; they stop the discharge from the
nose, and of course nature must have a vent somewhere and so she
establishes a discharge in the chest; the trouble progresses from
the mucous membranes into the lung, into the parenchyma of the
lungs, and is often of a tubercular character, and then these men
tell you the bacilli have come. This is spurious science. Clean,
healthy tissues are the only safeguard.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Aurum is full of
nasal troubles, with foetid discharge. The bones of the nose
necrose; syphilitic necrosis, the nose flattens down; the bones are
discharged. You see these people walking about with flattened-down
nose and if you get near enough to them the stench will be
observed. They are nearly all syphilitics. A few remedies have the
power of curing this syphilitic nose condition; Aurum, MERCURY and
HEPAR are three of them. I have cured this state a number of times
with HEPAR. I once cured a man after the bones were completely
softened, so that when the nose was handled it would bend right
over; only a sort of cartilaginous structure held the nose in
place. I gave that patient HEPAR. It cured him of syphilis after he
had been filled in vain with MERCURY. "Coryza, thick discharge,
like white of egg." "Mucous discharge from posterior nares in
morning." Tip of nose knobby, red, like LACH.; strawberry nose.
Little knobs on the nose composed of varicose veins in heart cases,
with disturbance of the right side of the heart; sometimes found in
old drinkers and in heart affections generally. Face red and
swollen. Aurum has cured epithelioma of the wing of the nose and
lip. Remember the horribly offensive odor from the nose, loss of
smell following pains in the nasal bones; nasal catarrh.
"Ulcerated, agglutinated, painful nostrils." "Crusts in nose."
"Nose feels obstructed as in dry coryza." With nearly all of these
nose affections, the patient is bowed down with sorrow, full of
grief; black clouds hang over him and he wants to die. Loathing of
life and wants to find some way to commit suicide.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Puffy under eyes."
"Blue about nose and lips." "Face glowing red" "Violent boring in
right zygomatic process when walking." "Carious teeth." "Toothache
at night." "Foul breath." "Syphilitic ulcers in palate and throat."
"Boring in hard palate." This medicine has cured craving for
alcohol, the craving of drunkards.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">ABDOMEN</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Another marked
feature of this medicine is its ability to harden, enlarge and
inflame the liver; induration with cardiac affections; enlargement
of the heart and liver. When you take into consideration the venous
system, the portal system and its close association with the heart
in establishing the circulation of blood in the abdomen, and the
work that it does in the abdomen as a great receiving apparatus,
you will not be surprised to find that heart and liver affections
are associated with hopelessness and despair. Notice, on the other
hand, something that will set you to thinking perhaps, in cases of
phthisis, none of them is hopeless, they think they are going to
get well; the lungs are almost gone with tubercles, but he knows if
he could only get up that little something out of the throat he
would get well. Notice then that peculiar relation between the
lungs and the understanding, and between the heart and the will.
With every little trouble located in the heart, there comes
hopelessness, but when the manifestation of disease is in the
lungs, there is hopefulness. Dropsical conditions of the abdomen.
"Inguinal hernia." "Tabes mesenterica." All of the glands of the
body are involved more or less.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-MALE-FEMALE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">All sorts of
disturbances of the sexual organs. "Testes indurated." "Frequent
nightly emissions." Complaints as the result of vices. "Hydrocele."
"Ulcers on scrotum after gonorrhoea." "Burning and stinging in
perineum." "Condylomata around anus." "Induration of uterus."
"Menses too late and scanty." "Uterus prolapsed and indurated."
"Leucorrhoea thick white." Complaints in the uterus and region of
the pelvis from straining and reaching up the arms; abortion from
reaching up at the windows and fixing a curtain, etc. Aurum is a
medicine that is suitable for induration of the uterus and
ulceration of the uterus as a result of repeated abortions. When
you study the loss of affections that is involved in such a state
and the affections or lack of affections that are found in Aurum
you can see a deep well-grounded similitude in the symptoms, and
that is the way to hunt for a remedy. It is in the sphere of the
physician to examine into this state of mankind in which he can
destroy his offspring and to examine into the nature of remedies
producing such a state. We see in Aurum this entire perversion of
all the loves of mankind, and finally their entire
destruction.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">RESPIRATION</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The symptoms of
asthma and of difficult breathing you would naturally expect to be
associated with the cardiac affections. Notice this also, that the
difficult breathing is of two kinds, such breathing as involves the
lung, and such breathing as involves the heart. So it is we have an
asthmatic condition of dyspnoea that is cardiac in character, and
dyspnoea that is purely respiratory. These are entirely distinct in
character; one belongs to such remedies as have a predominance of
action on the affections, and another belonging to those having a
predominance of action on the intelligence; one will involve the
lung and finally bring on emphysema; the other one is entirely
different in its character, with irregular heart action, and only
secondarily associated with emphysema. Study your pathology with
these things in mind and you will be able to perceive the nature of
sickness and its results. These things are not mere observation,
whims and theories, but are the outcome of studying things from
internal to external.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">CHEST-EXTREMITIES</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In this remedy, the
pains wander from joint to joint and finally locate in the heart.
Angina pectoris is often the ending of an old rheumatism that has
wandered from joint to joint. "Difficult breathing." If the case
goes on a little while, there will be blood spots, and if he lies
on the right side, the lower part will be dull on percussion and
the upper part will be resonant. Palpitation with great agony.
Extreme oppression in the region of the heart on walking fast and
going, upstairs with oedema of the lower limbs.</span></p>
