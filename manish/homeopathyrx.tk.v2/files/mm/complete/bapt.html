<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">BAPTISIA
TINCTORIA</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Bapt.)</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Baptisia is suitable
for acute diseases. It is principally a short-acting medicine,
suitable for complaints that are not long lasting. So far as we
know it is not an antipsoric, does not go deep into the life. All
of its acute diseases and complaints have the appearance of
zymosis, like scarlet fever, diphtheria, typhoid, and gangrenous
complaints. There is one thing that is unusual about it; it brings
on this septic state more rapidly than most other remedies. The
zymotic complaints of ARS., PHOS., RHUS-T, and BRY., are much
slower in their pace. But Baptisia is suitable for typhoids that
come on rapidly, and hence it is not so often suitable in
idiopathic typhoids. When an individual comes down suddenly from
cold, from malaria, from drinking poisonous waters, and from any
zymotic or septic cause he is hurled into bed in a few days,
instead of going through a period of four, five or six weeks. The
old idiopathic typhoid fevers come on slower. Baptisia is suitable
for those blood poisons that are highly septic, such as the
puerperal state, such as scarlet fever. He comes down perhaps with
the appearance of a sudden violent break down, with a remittent
fever. But all at once, it turns continued, and takes on septic
symptoms. So much for its progress and its pace. Every medicine
must be observed as to its velocity, as to its pace, as to its
periodicity, as to its motion, and its wave. We get that by looking
at the symptoms. You take an individual who has been down in a
mine, in the swamp, down in the mud, in the sewers, who has inhaled
foul gases, who goes into bed with a sort of stupor, from the very
beginning he feels stupid. It is not gradual, but he goes down very
suddenly, and he is stupid. He is prostrated. His face is mottled.
Sordes begin to appear on the teeth much earlier than in the
regular typhoid. The abdomen becomes distended much earlier than in
a regular typhoid; that is, one who is accustomed to observing
those things knows they are postponed for a number of days; while
with this remedy the third day the abdomen is distended, his mouth
is bleeding, and is putrid. His odors are horrible; and he is in a
marked state of delirium, such as would not be expected until the
typhoid is out for many days. So it has rapid running diseases. It
has velocity. That is, he is going down toward death rapidly. He is
increasing in his prostration more rapidly than usual. It is not a
gradual decline of days and weeks. He goes into a state of stupor.
When aroused he takes on delirium. It does not matter whether it is
scarlet fever, or typhoid fever, or a septic surgical fever, or a
puerperal fever, or what. He has fever, and if you look at him, and
talk to him, and turn him over, and rouse him up, and make him
realize that you want to say something to him-which is difficult-
he gives you the impression that he has been on a big drunk. That
is the first thought you will have in a Baptisia case. His
countenance is besotted. It is bloated and purple and mottled.
Blood oozes from the mouth. You have seen the besotted countenance
of drunkards, and it is like an old drunkard.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MENTAL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">His mind seems to be
gone. He does not know what he is talking about. He is in
confusion, and when aroused he attempts to say something, and
utters a word or two and it all flits away, and he is back in his
state of stupor again. No matter what disease that comes in, no
matter what inflammation is present, no matter what organ is
inflamed, if that state of the blood that can give rise to such
symptoms and such sepsis is present, if that state of the mind is
present, it is Baptisia.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">All of the
discharges are putrid. The odor is cadaverous, pungent;
penetrating. His perspiration, if he has any, is sour, foetid,
pungent, and penetrating. If he has no sweat, the body gives off an
odor that is unaccountable. The odor is so penetrating that on
going into the front door the whole house, if the room is open, is
filled with the odor. The odor from the stool is putrid and so
penetrating that it can be detected on first going into the
house.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Now, a strange thing
that runs through the remedy is a peculiar kind of mental
confusion, in which he is in a constant argument with his parts. He
seems to feel that there are two of him. He realizes a dual
existence whenever he is roused up. He will begin talking about the
other one in bed with him. It is said clinically that "his great
toe is in controversy with his thumb." Or," one leg is talking to
the other leg." Or, one part is talking to another part; or, he is
scattered around over the bed; fumbles and you ask him what he is
trying to do-"why, I am trying to get those pieces together." He
never succeeds; he is in delirium, of course. These are only
examples; you will get a new phase every time you get a Baptisia
case. Most of the time he is unconscious except when roused.
Sometimes mutters. You will see his lips go, and you rouse him to
see what he is about, and he is trying to get the pieces together.
"Confused as if intoxicated." There are stages when he is not quite
so stupid, and he is sleepless and restless. That is the exception.
Most generally you will find him lying upon one side curled up like
a dog, and he does not want to be disturbed. Again, when the stupor
is not so great he is restless, turns, and tosses. In that case, he
cannot sleep, because he cannot get the pieces together. He feels
if he could once get matters together he could go to sleep, and
these parts that are talking to each other keep him awake. His mind
wanders as soon as his eyes are closed. Dullness, especially at
night. Indisposition to think. Mind seems weak. There you find the
whole picture of the mental aspect in all complaints, in all acute
diseases-but they all come on in a hurry. They are zymotic, of a
low form such as scarlet fever, such as malignant diseases; and yet
it takes on a continued type of fever. These patients will die in
from ten to twelve days if let alone. Whereas, ordinary typhoid
will run for weeks, and sometimes die at the close of four weeks in
a crisis.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">PHYSICAL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The bleedings are
black and offensive. The putridity is marked. In the mouth, the
mucus from the throat and nose is bloody and putrid. It has a
diarrhoea. Thin, faecal, watery, yellow. It has a typical typhoid
discharge; the most typical typhoid stool is like yellow corn-meal
mush, coming on many times a day, but soft, pappy, just about the
consistency of soft mush. This remedy has that stool, but it is not
the commonest form-but the black, the brown, the dark. In treating
a good many cases of typhoid it was my fortune to observe a large
number of Baptisia cases, which the remedy cured promptly. The
stool where the Baptisia did the most service was like ground up
slate, slate colored, brownish. The odor was penetrating. In
addition to that I have seen this medicine cure that kind of
diarrhoea when it was slate colored, even thin as water, if it was
horribly putrid like decomposed meat; like the cadaver, attended
with great prostration-I have seen it cure that diarrhoea when
there were none of the elements of typhoid fever present. A simple
prostrating form of diarrhoea. Exhaustion. Exhaustion comes
rapidly. In three days, he has a deathly sinking coming over
him.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The headaches are
nondescript. Only those congestive attacks, frontal
headaches-violent pains in the head, and especially in the occiput,
such as occur in the low forms of disease. I hardly ever go into
the details of headaches. Baptisia is not a headache remedy. It is
not a remedy that we would single out to treat headaches with,
except such violent pains in the head of a congestive character
that are associated with this low form of fever.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE-FACE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It has
characteristic eye symptoms. Congestion. Redness. Pains in the
eyes, and back of the eyes. So it has with hearing. So it has with
nasal symptoms. But associated with fevers. But as soon as we come
to the face, we begin to realize the Baptisia symptoms, that
besotted expression. The countenance shows that. The eyes show it,
the face shows it. And these are the symptoms: "Dark red with
"besotted appearance. Hot and perceptibly flushed; dusky." That
tells the whole story. Burning; heat in the face. "Critical sweat
on forehead and face. Anxious, frightened look." On rousing from
sleep looks as if he had a horrible dream.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MOUTH-TEETH-THROAT</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">And then comes the
mouth, and the teeth, and the throat, and the tongue, all show
marked Baptisia features. The tongue is swollen, painful,
offensive. Covered with black blood. Raw; denuded. Stiff and dry as
leather. Described as if it was made of wood, or burnt leather;
ulcerated. Ulceration runs all through the remedy. Aphthous
patches. These little ulcers that start no bigger than a pin-head
become black and are so offensive and run together so that the
whole surface of the mouth will be in a state of ulceration; raw
and denuded, oozing a thick saliva that is putrid. The throat takes
on ulceration; is raw and bleeding. There may be diphtheritic
exudations in the throat. But, round about it there are those low,
dark, offensive surfaces. The throat is greatly swollen, and it is
with difficulty that he can swallow. Baptisia has been a very
useful remedy in gangrenous sore mouth and sore throat. "Cancrum
oris." The ulcers spread rapidly and eat rapidly. They are really
phagedenic. Sordes form rapidly on the teeth. And when he is roused
from sleep after a few hours of stupor there is a building up on
the lips and around the corners of the mouth ridges of dry blood;
very offensive. Bleeds much from the mouth, throat and nose. Thick
oozing. Putrid. "Tongue red, and dry in the middle. The roof of the
mouth swollen and feels numb. Foul or bitter nauseous taste in the
mouth. Tongue of a dark hue. Tongue dry, brown down the centre.
Tongue covered with a thick, brown crust. Tongue yellowish white,
deeply furred." Ulcers all over the mouth. " Baptisia has cured the
ulcerated sore throat of young mothers-and nursing sore mouth in
children, when the parts become dusky and the ulcers spread, and
the mouth is putrid, and prostration is coming on rapidly the child
or the mother is growing weak with great rapidity, is becoming
prostrated. Now, all this without fever. Many of these ulcerative
states in Baptisia are not attended with fever. It seems sometimes
as though there were not life enough to get up a fever. Aphthous
appearance in typhoid, in children, and with nursing mothers.
Canker sores in the mouth. "Putrid ulceration of the whole buccal
cavity." Now, with all this trouble saliva pours into the mouth, is
thick and ropy and runs all over the pillow; like we find in
MERCURY.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The sore throat may
be gangrenous. A strong feature of it is that the ulcers are rapid
and painless, as if numb, without sensation. But it has a painful
sore throat. "Fauces dark red; dark, putrid ulcers; tonsils and
parotids swollen. Putrid sore throat. Tonsils and soft palate
swollen, not accompanied by pain." Great swelling; great
tumefaction; purplish. The darker it is the more likely would I be
to think of Baptisia-but never a bright red. I have never seen the
Baptisia mental state associated with a bright red appearance. That
low form of mental state is associated with blood decomposition,
with duskiness, with a dark appearance of the skin, and of the
mucous membranes. Not bright red, not pink, as we find in BELL.
BELL. is more commonly bright red, although it has duskiness, but
nothing to the extent of Baptisia. There is nothing like the
putridity in BELL., that there is in Baptisia. "Oesophagus feels as
if constricted from above down to stomach." Now, we have another
phase of it. From the sore throat, the trouble extends into the
oesophagus, and the oesophagus is at first in a state of spasm.
Later it is paralyzed. Fluids will at first go down the throat, but
he cannot swallow a particle of solids. The bolus of food will go
into the upper end of the oesophagus and there it chokes him and
feels like a lump, and he "chokes and struggles and gags and throws
it back, and then takes water or fluids. He can swallow fluids but
he cannot swallow solids. Every particle of solid food gags; but he
can swallow liquids. NAT- M. and quite a number of other remedies
have spasms of the oesophagus coming on with nervous complaints,
but in this low state, I know of no other medicine having that one
symptom, having these features, and the paralysis, and the
spasmodic condition of the oesophagus. "The oesophagus feels as if
constricted from above down to the stomach." Constrictive feeling
causing frequent efforts at deglutition; throat sore, feels
constricted. CAN SWALLOW ONLY LIQUIDS. Children cannot swallow
solids. The smallest solid substance causes gagging, thus he cannot
use anything but milk; sometimes, thin, watery, offensive passages
day and night; associated with putridity, with the offensiveness,
with the duskiness and with the prostration. You need to know no
more, if it is diphtheria, or scarlet fever, if it is typhoid
fever, that will lead you to a certain remedy. "Paralysis of the
organs of deglutition." To draw out from every remedy that which is
positive, to get the associations that make up a particular remedy,
and that only is the duty of every clinician.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">ABDOMEN-STOOL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The abdomen is
distended; the stomach is distended. We may have these symptoms in
inflammation of the liver, when this remedy would be useful. Along
with the diseases that I have mentioned, tympanitic abdomen. Great
soreness in the right iliac fossa; so sore and tender, no bigger
than a fist; but all of this putridity, I am sure, would prevent
you from using a knife to cut off that little appendix.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Foetid, exhausting
diarrhoea. Aphthous diarrhoea;" which means that the parts of the
anus that roll out are ulcerated, little aphthous patches inside of
the margin. "Involuntary diarrhoea." Involuntary urine and stool in
these low forms of disease. "Dark brown, mucous and bloody stools.
Foetid stools." It has dysentery. After confinement the lochia
stops. Great tenderness of the abdomen.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">All these putrid
signs-breaking down of the blood, the appearance of the face, the
sudden prostration, suddenly becoming stupid; and add to that the
mental symptoms-these are all signs for Baptisia in puerperal
fever. Now, intermingled with this after the case has been running
on a few days the limbs become helpless and tremulous. The tongue
when it is put out is tremulous. The hand when it is raised is
tremulous, and the limbs are tremulous. Quivering all over the
body. Prostration increases. The jaw drops and he lies upon the
back unconscious, with the mouth wide open. He gradually slides
down toward the foot of the bed. A peculiar sort of paralytic
weakness. This is how the prostration increases with the disease;
but even yet when he is as low as this, with the signs present,
Baptisia will break that fever. Baptisia will stop the typhoid
fever, when it is indicated. Prostration and trembling. Huddles
down in bed, feels as if sinking away. Lies in a semiconscious
condition when she appears dying. Excessive drowsiness. Delirious
stupor. Lies in a semi-comatose state. "Discharges and exhalations
foetid." Breath, stool, urine, ulcers; all putrid. Ulceration of
mucous membranes.</span></p>
