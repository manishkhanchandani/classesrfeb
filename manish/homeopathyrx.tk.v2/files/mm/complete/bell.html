<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">BELLADONNA</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Bell.)</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Belladonna is a
remedy that takes hold of the system with great violence. It is
especially suitable to plethoric, vigorous individuals and
intellectual people. Brainy people have complaints coming on
suddenly, providing they are in a substantial state of health, and
are reasonably plethoric and vascular. The complaints of Belladonna
come on suddenly, run a regular course, and subside suddenly. The
pains and suffering come on suddenly and with great violence, and
subside suddenly. Colds ultimate rapidly, run a sharp course, a
course of great violence, and subside suddenly. Belladonna
especially affects the whole vascular system, the heart, lungs,
brain and nervous system.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">PHYSICAL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Among the earliest
conditions to examine is the heat. It has inflammations of all the
organs, especially the brain, lungs, and liver. The intestines are
also involved as well as the other organs. These inflammations are
always attended by VIOLENT HEAT; the heat is something unusual. It
is more marked in Belladonna than in almost any other remedy. When
you put your hand upon a Belladonna subject you will suddenly
withdraw it, the heat is so intense. The memory of the heat is
carried in the hand and fingers for some time. Pains,
inflammations, and sufferings, nightly attacks of delirium, violent
attacks inflammatory in character are attended with that kind of
heat. No matter where the inflammation is, there is that same
intense heat. There are times, though, when that kind of heat is
present, and it is not Bell. and that is when the fever is of the
continued type. Bell. has no continued fever in it. It is true the
older books tell you about Bell. for this violent heat in typhoid
and some other continued fevers, but if you examine Bell., from
beginning to end you will find nothing continued in its fever. Its
fever is remittent. It never comes on in its complaints gradually
like typhoid. It has not the gradual rise and the gradual fall like
a continued fever. I only mention that so that you will not be
lost. Our lamented Herring, one of the ablest teachers the world
ever had, classes Bell. for typhoid fever when the delirium and the
heat are somewhat like Bell. but let me, tell you just what will
take place. When you give Bell. for the delirium in typhoid
fever-for such a delirium as looks like Bell. you may subdue the
delirium, but other manifestations will rise in that fever. You
will not subdue the fever, but you will subdue the patient. The
patient will be sick longer; will go into a greater state of
prostration than if you had let that delirium alone. But STRAMONIUM
fits perfectly Hering's description of a case in which he says
Bell. should be given. The idea of that heat must be well fixed in
the mind. HEAT, INTENSE HEAT, VIOLENT HEAT.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There is another
phase of Bell. that runs all through these inflammatory complaints
and its fevers. The inflamed parts, and very commonly the skin, are
VERY red, and, as the inflammation advances, grow dusky; as the
fever advances the face becomes mottled; but the first
representation of Bell., is bright red, and the skin is shiny. An
inflamed part that can be seen will be red. In inflammation of
glands, the skin over the glands will be bright red in spots. Hence
red spots in the neck over inflamed glands. Inflammation of the
parotid glands, inflammation of the sub-maxillary glands,
inflammation of the glands of the neck-there will be a spot as read
as fire over each. The throat is as red as scarlet. The mucus
membrane is inflamed, and red as scarlet. After a little it grows
dusky, finally mottled; showing the character and direction of the
Bell. constitution. It travels gradually towards a zymotic state,
such as we see in scarlet fever, in low inflammatory conditions; at
first intense congestion, but vaso-motor paralysis follows. Intense
congestion and blueness, or purple and mottled.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Another grand
feature of Bell., is present in its inflamed parts, and in its
painful parts. Whenever Bell, brings out anything like a decided
action, it has BURNING; Intense burning. The burning in the throat
with a Bell. sore throat is like a coal of fire. Inflammation of
the tonsils, burning like fire. The skin burns, and it is burning
hot to the sensation of the patient, and intensely hot to the
doctor. The skin burns in scarlet fever. He says, "It burns so,
doctor, it burns so;" in bilious or remittent fever. In
inflammation of an organ, the skin burns, there is a burning fever,
and the part itself burns. Inflammation of the bladder, with
burning. Congestion of the brain, and the head burns. Congestion of
the throat and the throat burns. It is hot locally, and it also
burns subjectively. In gastritis there is burning. In inflammation
of the liver, the liver burns. Congestion of the liver with
jaundice, and the liver burns. Now, we have three leading features;
do not call them "key notes," for that is not what I mean; HEAT,
REDNESS AND BURNING. We will see how they modify the whole feature
of the sickness, how they permeate and ramify, and how they take
meaning.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">But, that is not
all. We have much SWELLING in Bell. The inflamed parts swell
rapidly; are extremely sensitive to touch; are very painful, with
the sensation as if they would burst, with pressive pains, stinging
and burning. There is heat, redness and burning in these inflamed
parts, as well as swelling. Swelling, stinging, burning, throbbing.
All over, he THROBS. With all congestions and inflammations, he
throbs. The part itself throbs, and his carotids throb. When
children are sick in bed with congestion of the brain, they have an
intensely hot head. If old enough to talk about it, they will say,
"It burns." But then we will notice" the throbbing. The temporal
arteries and the carotids pulsate, with great violence. A turmoil
is going on. An earthquake is taking place. Everything is being
shaken when the patient needs Bell. It is one of the most painful
of remedies. It is so sensitive to pain. So sensitive that he
suffers more than ordinary people do from the pain. And, remember,
THE PAINS COME SUDDENLY, they remain longer or shorter, and THEY GO
SUDDENLY. They do this in neuralgia; they do this in inflammatory
conditions; they do it in inflamed organs; they do it wherever they
come. Pains, tear, shoot, burn, and sting, and press, and smart,
all at once. All of these characteristics are bundled up into one
bundle, so that he suffers. All of his pains are worse from motion,
worse from light, worse from a jar, worse from cold. He wants to be
wrapped up warmly, and is worse from any exposure or a draft. The
headaches are like many of the other pains; it feels as if the
brain was going up and down, tearing and burning at every step he
takes, and from every motion of the eyes, or turning the eyeballs,
or going up stairs, rising from his seat, or sitting down; all
motion creates violent pains; feels as if the head would burst, as
if the eyes would be pressed out. If he moves he starts the heart
to pulsate on his sore parts and he calls them "hammering pains."
Wherever that pain is he cannot have it touched. If it is touched,
it will throb. If uncovered it will become worse. If someone walks
across the floor, the jar makes him worse. THE JAR OF THE BED, if
he is in bed, is a common aggravation of Bell. If he is so sick
that he is in bed, THE JAR OF THE BED makes all of his complaints
worse. You go to the bedside of a patient suffering from an
inflamed liver, and he will not let you put your hand on the bed,
for the jar makes him worse. If the pain is in the abdomen; if it
is an inflamed uterus; if it is in confinement, it is the same.
This aggravation from the jar is such a marked feature that it is
not always confined to inflammations. It is often a modifier in a
state of nervous hyperesthesia. A woman in confinement, when there
is no inflammation, and none threatening, is in such a state of
hyperesthesia that she wants the windows closed to keep the air
out; she does not want to be touched; she does not want the bed
moved, any little jar aggravates; she is so sensitive to a jar,
even when there is no sensitive part. You go to such a case, and
you will realize in time that you are going to have a difficult and
painful labor, without Bell. But with a dose of Bell. all of these
complaints pass away quickly, so quick is the action of this
medicine. The jar of the bed will often reveal to you the nature of
the remedy. If you walk to the bedside of a patient suffering from
gallstone colic, with violent pains, he cannot have the bed
touched. His face is red, his skin burns, he cannot be touched, he
is in excruciating agony, and he tells that before you have crossed
the room. You see it all. He says, "Don't touch the bed, doctor."
That is a special feature; the aggravation from a jar is
marked.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Spasms-general
spasms and local spasms. Spasms of little canals, of the circular
fibres, of tubular organs, like that I have spoken of in the
gallstone colic. In the ductus communis choledochus there is a
clutching-or it may be in the cystic duct that the circular fibres
clutch that little bit of stone and will not let it through. The
passage is large enough to admit it and it has started to go
through-but the irritation of the part causes a spasm and it
clutches that little stone. You put a dose of Bell, on his tongue,
the spasm lets up, stone passes on, and there is no more trouble;
in fifteen minutes the gallstone colic is gone. There is never a
failure in homeopathic prescribing in gallstone colic. The symptoms
are not always Bell. but in this instance, where that horrible
sensitiveness is present, it is Bell.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Convulsions in
infants." They are violent and are usually associated with cerebral
congestion. The skin is always in a state of fever. They are
brought on from light, from a draft of cold air, from the infant
becoming cold. Nervous, brainy children, those with a good sized
head, and plump, large-headed boys; boys especially, but also girls
that have boys' heads, when exposed to the cold have convulsions.
Light, motion and cold will bring on these convulsions. The Bell.
subject as an individual, like BRY., is worse in all his complaints
from motion. Motion brings on convulsions, motion brings on pain;
motion increases the action of the heart and brings on throbbing;
motion brings on many complaints and increases the sufferings. Now
think of these generals whenever you come to Bell. This idea of
Bell. must prevail. No matter how many little symptoms you
accumulate, get at these first.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The mental symptoms
of Bell. are delightful to study, but dreadful to look upon. The
mental symptoms are such as come on in intense fevers, such as are
observed in maniacal excitement, in delirium. Excitement runs all
through. Violence runs all through the mental symptoms. The mental
symptoms are all active, never passive. There is no passive
delirium in Bell. It is a wild state. He is wild; striking, biting,
tearing things; doing unusual things; doing strange things; doing
unexpected things. He is in a state of excitability. These mental
symptoms that come on during fevers, the delirium and excitement,
are very commonly ameliorated by eating a little light food. That
is not generally known in Bell., but it is quite a strong feature.
But remember the violence, and with it, if you go to the bedside
where there is this violent delirium, keep in mind the HEAT,
REDNESS AND BURNING.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Full of
imaginations. Sees ghosts, and spirits, and officers, and wild
things. In the early part of the fever, the delirium is very
violent and excitable; but as it passes on, he goes into a sleep, a
sort of half-slumber, a semi-comatose state. Apparently in a dream,
and he screams out. Dreams horrible things. Sees in his dreams the
things that he talks about. When he has real sleep, or resting, as
near as it is for him to rest, he has violent dreams; nightmare.
Sees things on fire. He is in a delirium, and in torment. He
becomes stupid at times, appears to lose consciousness. Loses the
memory of all things and then becomes wild. His delirium goes on
when he appears to be sleeping. These symptoms often occur with
cerebral congestion, the violent cerebral congestion of the infant.
If they are old enough to talk, they will talk about the hammering
in the head. In Bell. the infant also commonly remains in a
profound stupor, the profound stupor that goes with congestion of
the brain; pupils dilated; skin hot and dry; face red, throbbing
carotids. Finally the child becomes pale as the stupor increases
and the neck is drawn back, because as it progresses the base of
the brain and spine become involved, and the muscles of the neck
contract, drawing the head backwards, and he rolls the head; eyes
staring, pupils dilated. This mental state is associated with
scarlet fever and with cerebro-spinal meningitis.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Again, these mental
states take the form of acute mania, when the patient will bite the
spoon; will bark like a dog; will do all sorts of violent things;
even jump out of the window. He has to be restrained, put in a
strait-jacket. The face is red, and the skin is hot, and the
patient at times says that he burns all over, or that the head
burns, and the head is very hot. During all this time, the feet are
cold. Head hot, feet cold, or feet and hands cold as ice. It seems
all the blood is being hurried to the head. All sorts of delusions
and hallucinations are mingled with the acute mania; ghosts; horrid
monsters; strange things, and deformed subjects. Fear of imaginary
things, and wants to run away. In the delirium of Bell. he wants to
jump out of the window, wants to run, wants to get away from his
attendants. He thinks they are doing him injury. Throughout the
acute mania, and throughout the delirious state, all the
manifestations partake of violence. Destructiveness. The Bell.
patient in the most acute state must be watched, controlled,
handled, and sometimes tied. In the text, it describes these states
as "rage, fury." He wants to do violence. "Moaning. Instead of
eating, bit wooden spoon in two, gnawed plate, and growled and
barked like a dog. A boy violently sick ran around the room
laughing immoderately." It has an insane laughter. A loud,
boisterous laughter. "A piece of bread, which he took to be a
stone, he threw far from him. He turns and rolls in bed in a
perfect rage. Aversion to noise and company." Aversion to light; is
better in the dark. At times, a more passive state intervenes
between these attacks of violence. The active time is always that
of violence; but there is sometimes a more passive state when the
patient will sit or lie in bed and tear the bed clothing, or break
anything that she can get her hands on. If it is a stick, she will
break it up.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Running all through
the complaints, whether delirium, fever, or pains, there is
STARTING. Starting in sleep like an electric shock. Just as soon as
he falls asleep a sensation like an electric shock throughout the
body. "Starts in fright at approach of others. Fear of imaginary
things, wants to run away from them." "GREAT ANXIETY" runs through
the remedy. As a patient comes out of these attacks of delirium, as
he comes out of convulsions, fear is depicted upon the face. The
patient is in great excitement; the circulation is in a state of
great excitement; the heart is in great excitement; motion and
emotion increase the beating of the heart.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It may have been
gleaned that Bell. is a remedy that IS OVER SENSITIVE; a state of
hyperaesthesia; extreme irritability of tissues. This is said to be
an increased irritability of the nerve centres. This develops a
state of increased ability to taste, and to smell, and to feel;
excitability of the sensorium. Sensitive to impressions. SENSITIVE
TO LIGHT, TO NOISE, TO TOUCH, TO JAR. The sensorium is violently
excited. Excessive nervous irritability stands out, perhaps, as one
of the most prominent features of Bell. in contrast with medicines
like OPIUM, that deprives the patient of all sensitivity. The more
congestion there is in Bell, the more excitability. The more
congestion there is in OPIUM the less excitability. And yet they
are very similar in many respects; very similar in aspect; in the
appearance of the eyes and face; similar in pathological states. If
I were to prescribe on the pathological state, the congestion of
the brain, the appearance, without taking in the intensity of the
one or other, I would not be able to distinguish between OPIUM and
Bell. They often antidote each other. But we do not prescribe on
pathology, but upon symptoms, after careful
individualization.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">VERTIGO</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Vertigo," with this
intense excitability. Turning in bed, or moving the head makes him
dizzy. "Things go round." "Vertigo with pulsations." Moving the
head increases the pulsation, and the vertigo. The patient lies in
bed; cannot hold the head up. This increased sensitiveness
especially applies to the scalp. We notice it particularly in the
woman. She cannot have the hair bound up. It is often the case that
Bell. patients will not have the hair combed or brushed. "Lets the
hair hang down the back;" so sensitive is the scalp. "Hair feels as
if pulled. Does not want the hair touched." There are some remedies
that correspond to extreme irritation in very sensitive natures;
like HEP., where she faints with the pain; like NIT-AC., when
cannot bear the noise of vehicles going along the street, because
it creates such violent sufferings; like COFF., where footsteps
aggravate all the complaints; he was so sensitive to pain that the
noise of one entering the door when he was on the third floor
aggravated his sufferings intensely, though no one else could hear
it. In NUX VOMICA, even the sound of footsteps increases the pain
all over the body. Bell. has in its nature all this sensitiveness
to pain. It is a part of the general sensorium; the whole bodily
state is intensified. The CHAMOMILLA patient is oversensitive to
pain, but we do not need to sympathize with the CHAMOMILLA patient,
he will fight it out himself. But you will pity the Bell. patient,
you will pity the PULS. patient and the NIT-AC. patient.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A strange part of it
also is the reactive excitability. The reaction to medicine is so
quick and so sudden that I have many times heard a patient say,
before I had turned my back away from the bed, "that medicine has
relieved me," so quick is the reaction. In many medicines, reaction
is slowed down, but in Bell. it is intensified. So it is in NUX
VOMICA and in ZINC. When the case is very acute, but sometimes also
when the case is somewhat chronic, this sensibility is marked.
CUPR. is so sensitive all over. It has sensitive warts; it has
sensitive skin, sensitive polypi, everything sensitive; and it is
so sensitive in its reaction that, when it is needed, partially
indicated remedies will not work, because the patient is so
oversensitive to everything that everything overacts. The smallest
dose, the mildest dose, the simplest dose overacts and everything
aggravates. Odors aggravate; well selected remedies disturb instead
of cure. CUPR. tones down, relieves that sensitivity, and
well-selected remedies will then act curatively and long. CUPR.
lacks it in that high state of congestion-it is not like Bell. in
that; CUPR. does not have that sensibility along with the active
fever and congestion, the throbbing and disturbance of the
circulation; but it has it in a chronic state. Women and children
are so sensitive that they get no sympathy-and it is not suitable
for hysterical ones either, but those that are not able to control
themselves perfectly. Such is CUPR. We have medicines that are
suitable to sensitive people, and especially sensitive women.
Sensitive to odors, sensitive to every conceivable influence. The
doctor who will go out and take care of these poor sick little
mortals, who understands their nature, perceives their quality, and
relieves them of their suffering, will command the whole community,
in spite of the reputation of all the doctors that are there before
him. He must not be one who measures everybody by his own
sensorium; he may be a pachyderm, but he will find patients that
are sensitive.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This sensitivity is
present in most of the Bell. headaches. There are stabbing pains,
throbbing pains, shooting pains, all in connection with congestion.
They are all sensitive to motion, to every jar, to light, even to
the winking of the eyes; sensitive to draft. Bell. will be
indicated when the head is rolling-the patient rolling the head
because the pain is so severe he cannot keep still, although the
motion increases the headache. A child lies, turns, and tosses its
head with congestion of the brain, screaming out with the brain
cry, a sudden shriek. After awhile it wakes up and commences to
toss the head, and every few minutes it shrieks with that brain
cry; it is going into a stupor, the neck is drawn back, the face is
flushed, it is now becoming pale. There are times of stupor, and in
that stupor the child cries out. In all brain troubles, we must be
careful about feeding much, or overloading the stomach, because the
stomach is very feeble. It will not digest much, but the food
should be well selected and light.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Great heaviness of
the head. The head feels like a weight, and is drawn back.
Sometimes we see the head drawn back from contraction of the
muscles of the neck when the membranes of the upper portion of the
spine are involved. Again, we see the Bell. patient drawing the
head back himself, because drawing the head back often ameliorates
the violent headaches. This amelioration is kept up so long as he
holds the head back. Aggravated from bending the head forward when
sitting, from bending the head forward when standing, or stooping.
It feels as if the brain would fall out or push forward. This
increases the headache so much that it sometimes turns into
knife-like, or hammering pains. These are the expressions used.
Sensation of nails and hammers, jagging and tearing; but with all,
pressure and throbbing. When rising from a seat these sensations
are all intensified. Throbbing; pulsation, like hammers hitting the
inside of the sore skull, described by patients as if the inside of
the skull was one continuous sore and was being pecked by hammers
with every pulsation. Sometimes it will settle down while sitting
still, or while lying; but rising up from a chair will set that
hammer going. "Expansive" is an expression that is often used by
the patient, and it was used by the provers. Expansive sensation,
as if the head was enlarged; pressure from within out. All these
headaches are relieved by pressure upon the outside. Sudden touch
or pressure will aggravate; but pressure that is gradually
increased and brought to bear carefully upon the head will
ameliorate, like the pressure of a bandage, or a tight-fitting cap.
Again, all of these headaches are brought on by exposure to the
cold air; from standing in the cold air with the head uncovered.
Sometimes a severe headache will come on from merely having the
haircut. Congestion of the head lasts for days, with throbbing and
pulsating; from having the haircut. Ear troubles, chest complaints,
rheumatic complaints come on from having the haircut or from
standing in the cool air with the hat off; so sensitive is the head
to cold. It may be said of this remedy that complaints of various
parts of the body come through the head and go downwards.
Complaints in the lower extremities, rheumatic complaints of the
joints, with great redness and swelling, come on from uncovering
the head, from exposure of the head, or from getting the head wet,
or from being caught in a shower. There is one complaint, which
will puzzle you if you ever meet it and you do not know just what I
am going to tell you. The complaints of Bell. in a general way are
ameliorated from rest, and aggravated from motion; but there is a
kind of restlessness with tearing pain from the hips down, most
troublesome to observe, that keeps the patient walking all of the
time. The instant there is rest the pains come on. They sometimes
shoot downwards, they sometimes tear up and down the nerves; and
this comes on from exposure of the head, and not from getting, the
feet wet. Complaints of ACONITUM and PULSATILLA come on from
getting the feet wet, and these complaints rise upwards, come on
through the feet and go upwards and affect the head. Bell.
complaints come on from exposure of the head and go downwards;
sometimes affect the head, sometimes the chest, sometimes the
stomach, sometimes centre in the abdomen, sometimes centre in the
uterus and ovaries. RHUS-T. has complaints from getting wet, but
the complaints are in the parts that are wet. If he gets the legs
wet, he will have rheumatism in the legs. There is a vast
distinction, and this distinction has to be made in almost every
prescription you will make. Homeopathy is a matter of
individualization as to how complaints spread. Some complaints
begin on the right side of the body and spread to the left. Some
complaints begin in the top of the body and go downwards. That is
the way this remedy acts. In some remedies, the exposure of the
feet to an ice-cold draft will bring on headache (SIL.); but in
Bell. the exposure will bring on a headache, or neuralgia of the
lower extremities. Now that pain that comes on from rest is an
exception in Bell. That illustrates again the importance of
distinguishing very decidedly between generals and particulars.
Without knowing "generals" and "particulars», you will never do
accurate prescribing. The lower extremities here are the
particulars. The patient and the general condition of the patient
are ameliorated by rest; the symptoms of the patient are
ameliorated by rest. All of those symptoms that can be predicted of
the patient himself are ameliorated by rest, but the pains of the
lower limbs, as described, those neuralgic pains are ameliorated by
motion, and come on in rest. That does not mean that ALL THE pains
in the lower extremities are ameliorated by motion, because the
pains in rheumatism are invariably ameliorated by rest, and
aggravated by motion. Those tearing pains, from the hips downwards,
with no swelling, come on during rest. All remedies are full of
freaks, and it is the figuring out of these peculiarities that
enables us to do good prescribing.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">With all the
complaints of Bell. do not lose sight of the congestion upwards.
"Rush of blood to the head. Cold extremities." Cold feet, cold
hands; hot head.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE-VISION</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Inflammatory
conditions of the eyes. "Glistening eyes. Dilated pupils. Flushed
face. Intense redness of the inflamed part." Inflammation of all
the tissues of the eyes, the lids, and all the parts of the
eyeball, with most violent pain. Heat, redness, and burning. These
three strong features that run through the remedy will be found in
the eye sufferings. Pulsation, tumefaction, lachrymation; intense
pains; sufferings all worse from motion, and worse from light. Most
intense photophobia. "Flashes of light and flickerings before the
eyes." When reading, lines appear crooked. "Dimness of vision, or
actual blindness." Intense congestion and fullness of all the
parts. "Apoplexy of the retina. Half-opened, protruding, staring
eyes." You will see that in the infant when the child lies in a
stupor; eyes half open; congestion of the brain; face flushed and
intensely hot; rolling the head from side to side; if it has been
going on for several days the face will later become pallid, and
the neck drawn back. In these congestive troubles, lying with the
eyes half open; almost no winking. "Orbital neuralgias. Protruding
eyes, with dilated pupils. Inflammation of the optic nerve and
retina. Eyes congested and red." Another feature belonging to the
eye is strabismus. Not those cases coming on gradually, such as
will need the surgeon, but those that come on with congestion of
the brain, with this state of congestion and dilated pupils and
rolling the head from side to side, flushed face, throbbing
carotids and intense heat. After a day or two, the eye begins to
turn in, and the little one is cross-eyed. That is an additional
indication for Bell. Sometimes, coming out of a severe congestion,
the strabismus remains and Bell. is sometimes the suitable remedy.
All of these cases coming on from the circulatory conditions should
be cured with remedies. They should never be sent to the surgeon.
Though they remain some time, even months, they will be cured by
well-selected remedies, while those that come on gradually, and
those that are born so, will not be relieved by remedies. Only
those spasmodic ones that are associated with, and come on from,
congestion of the brain. In connection with congestion of the liver
and duodenal catarrh, there is yellowishness in the
eyes.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">EAR</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In inflammations of
the ear which go on to suppuration Bell. is rarely useful. We have
to look to deep acting remedies. We may have the pain, tenderness,
oversensitiveness, all inflammatory conditions; but cases requiring
Bell, rarely go on to suppuration.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Now we come to the
mucous membranes, the nose, mouth, throat, larynx, chest, the
mucous membrane extending into the ear through the Eustachian tube,
and we have another strong feature of Bell. which characterizes
most of its conditions. GREAT DRYNESS; a sensation of dryness.
Dryness in the nose; mouth; of the tongue; in the throat; in the
chest, and such evidences as dry cough and spasmodic conditions.
These are so general that with the nose symptoms, the coryza, the
throat symptoms, the cough, this is intensified; dryness of mucous
membranes will generally be found. It is that way with PHOS. When
PHOS. has a sore throat it will have dryness of the mouth, tongue
and air passages. This is general as to the respiratory tract. Then
there is coryza with much sneezing. "Pricking, burning in the
nose." Hot sensation in the nose. The general states present much
redness of the face, much heat with the coryza; hot head, cold
extremities; marked headache, because there is dryness. The very
dryness itself is sometimes causative of pain, because the natural
flow from the mucous membranes is dried up. Whenever we have
checked secretions we have fever, and in Bell. this is marked.
Checking of the discharge with fever, with heat, redness and
burning; red face, burning face; heat in the face and head, and
cold extremities. It says in the text, "maddening headache, with
suppressed catarrh."</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Now, in such a
climate as this most people during winter and cold weather and the
changes have more or less mucous flow from the nose, and eyes, and
air passages. They are better when this takes place. All at once,
it stops, and all the parts become dry; then look out. An awful,
maddening, throbbing headache comes on. It is not so suitable for
those old catarrhs where there is a copious flow of thick, yellow
mucus. The catarrhal state wherein Bell. is useful is simply the
exaggeration of the whitish mucous flow. Where it has been thick
and yellow, and then stops suddenly from a cold, and a coryza comes
on, Bell. is worthless. Always bear in mind that you select for
suppressed catarrh a medicine that is within the sphere of the
symptoms that have been suppressed. Hence, the medicine for thick,
yellowish-green discharges might be MERC., SULPHUR, or PULSATILLA;
then you are within the range of medicines capable of
re-establishing the flow, and at the same time beginning a curative
effect on the state of the tissue, leaving the patient in a much
better state.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">FACE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Violent faceaches.
Rending, tearing pains in the face; throbbing pains in the face.
Pains in the face worse on the right side; worse from a jar; with
much heat; throbbing carotids; hot head; brought on from exposure
to cold wind, and riding in the cold wind. Bell. has cured
paralytic conditions, but CAUSTICUM is generally the remedy for
paralysis of the face from riding in a cold wind. Spasms of the
muscles of the face. Extraordinary twitchings of the face.
Erysipelas in the face; a bright red gradually becoming purple if
there is a fever accompanying it. In the neuralgic pains, there is
always more or less congestion of the face with violent pains, and
the face will be bright red. With the zymotic state, as the febrile
condition becomes more profound, and as the blood becomes more
zymotic, the face grows from duskiness into a mottled state, as you
will see in BAPT., more marked in BAPT. than in Bell. "Red face,
with burning heat."</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">TEETH-
MOUTH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The teeth are full
of pains, congestions, and aches of a similar character. Very
sensitive teeth.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The tongue should be
a dry tongue, as that is general with its mucous membranes. Dry
mouth; dry tongue; swollen tongue; protruding tongue, dry and hard,
feels like leather. Loss of sensation, loss of taste, loss of power
of the tongue and loss of speech are all Bell. features. "Paralytic
weakness of the tongue; trembling of the tongue when it is
protruded." It comes out weak. In a very few, days the Bell. fever
patient is greatly reduced, is greatly exhausted, has almost a
paralytic weakness. When he raises the hand and holds it a moment,
it trembles in the same way. That which is found in the tongue is
only a part of the general state. Trembling from congestion of the
nerve centers. The papillar of the tongue are erect, and the tongue
is bright red. Bright red tongue in scarlet fever. Bright red
tongue in congestion of the brain, with the erect papillae. When
going over ARUM TRIPHYLLUM I told you it had been pronounced
"strawberry tongue." It is the same with Bell. The tongue looks as
red as a strawberry, and the papilla; stick up like seeds. "Red
streak in the middle of the tongue, wide and broader towards the
point. Tongue, white centre with red edges." White tongue with
brain affections is not uncommon. It has thick, milk-white,
delicate fur all over the tongue in brain troubles. "Dryness of the
mouth, with thirst." "Dryness of the mouth, with no thirst." Bell.
is full of thirst, we will find when we come to study the stomach
symptoms. Sometimes Bell. wants large quantities, sometimes water
constantly to wet the mouth, like ARS. It is a common feature in
Bell., like ARS., to want water little and often. Just enough to
wet his parched tongue, mouth and throat. Dryness in posterior
nares and the mucus that he drags down from the posterior nares is
tough and stringy, and very scanty, and it is white, or, if changed
at all from white, it is bloody. Yet I have not said anything about
this remedy for bloody discharges and for bleeding. We will find
before we finish that it is a haemorrhagic remedy that parts bleed
easily. There is bleeding from the eyes, bleeding from the nose,
bleeding from the throat, bleeding from the larynx, bleeding from
the chest, bleeding from the bladder, bleeding from the uterus.
Ulcers bleed. Little fine ulcers in the throat no bigger than a
pin-head. Little aphthous patches bleed.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">THROAT</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">An aphthous
inflammation of the throat; but the most of the complaints of the
throat are dry and red. Great tumefaction. Extremely sensitive;
much swelling; inability to swallow. Great pain on swallowing, with
all the sensitivity of the surrounding parts, with the sore throat,
and with the inflamed throat. Inflammation and swelling of the
tonsils, with red face, intense heat, throbbing carotids, high
fever, coming on from cold. Fauces and pharynx deep red. Soft
palate and tonsils swollen. Swallowing painful, particularly of
fluids. Speech thick. "Feels like a lump in the throat" that is
from the swollen tonsils. Constant scraping and hawking in the
throat. The pharynx and larynx are very commonly in a state of
spasm; partly from dryness, partly from extreme sensitiveness of
the nerves of the part. Clutching of the throat on going to sleep,
clutching of throat on coughing. Spasms of the oesophagus.
"Spasmodic constriction of the throat." Constrictions that are
spasmodic. Constrictions of the larynx, of the pharynx, of the
throat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Bell. has
constrictive pains in parts that feel like the clutch of fingers.
That sensation of clutching is felt in the uterus; it is a spasm.
It is felt in the liver; it is felt in the brain; it is felt in the
throat. Jerking and twitching of muscles, with violent pain, in
painful parts. That is a strong Bell. feature. Patients sometimes
in their inability to describe their feelings will say, "Doctor, I
feel a clutching in there."</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This constriction
that comes in the sore throat occurs just in the act of swallowing
fluids or solids, and that action will force the food and fluids up
into the nose, and sometimes out of the nose. Some remedies have it
as a paralytic condition, because the muscles of deglutition are
paralyzed and they do not favor the natural contracting actions to
force the food down the oesophagus, and in that, way the food is
forced up into the nose and causes strangling. In Bell., in its
acute states, its inflammatory conditions and its spasms would
distinguish it from LACHESIS, where it occurs as a paralytic
condition after diphtheria, and from ALUMINA, which has a spasm of
the oesophagus. These are slow in coming on, Bell. is early. The
early part of the fever is the time of its irritation. The latter
part of the fever is the time of its relaxation. Rapidly forming
aphthous patches upon the tonsils. With the sore throat such as we
have described you will nearly always find an enlargement and
inflammation, or soreness of the glands, under the jaws about the
neck. Tenderness along with a Belladonna sore throat is a natural
concomitant.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">STOMACH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A strange feature
running through the Bell. fevers of all sorts is an unconquerable
craving for lemons, and lemon-juice. Lemonade seems to agree
sometimes. In acute diseases when they crave lemon it is good for
them. They often crave things to eat. You must not be so violently
temperate and in favor of prohibition, that if a patient longs for
beer in acute sufferings you will not give it. "Thirst for water
changed into thirst for beer." Thirst for things that could not be
endorsed in health, even. "Excessive thirst for cold
water."</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the stomach and
bowels, we have inflammatory conditions, which can all be grouped
as one. Pain, burning, distress, distension; sensitive to a jar,
and to the slightest motion, and to the slightest pressure.
Sensitive to a jar and sensitive to motion. "Pain in the stomach
extending through to the spine." Inflammation of the stomach from
becoming chilled, with intense heat; with much burning. It has
violent colic, intense cramping pain in children. Face red and hot;
pain relieved only by bending forward. There are exceptional
instances where it has been relieved by bending backward, when it
is similar to DIOS. The mother finds that by holding the child on
her hand it will relieve the colic. That is like COLOCYNTHIS; but
COLOC. is without much fever, without much thirst, a pain in one
spot, an intense colic in the abdomen ameliorated by doubling up,
ameliorated by bending across something hard, is COLOCYNTHIS. In
that, instance COLOC. can be prescribed on that one group of
symptoms.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">ABDOMEN-RECTUM-STOOL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Great pain in the
ileo-coecal region; cannot bear the slightest touch, even the bed
clothes." There are instances where Bell. is the remedy in
appendicitis.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Belladonna has
dysenteric troubles. Diarrhoea, with scanty fluid stool; marked
straining, but with it, the face is flushed. Heat, redness and
burning in the face and head. Cold extremities, with hot head. Much
straining, but passes scanty stool. "Spasmodic constriction of
sphincter ani; with haemorrhoids." Haemorrhoids that are violently
painful, that are intensely red, that are greatly swollen and
inflamed, a high grade of inflammation; cannot be touched; must lie
with limbs wide apart, the haemorrhoids are painful and there is
much burning.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">BLADDER-URINE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">No remedy has a
greater irritation in the bladder and along the urinary tract than
Bell. The urging to urinate is constant. The urine dribbles, and it
burns intensely along the whole length of the urethra. The whole
urinary tract is in a state of irritation. Bell. has cured
inflammation of the bladder. With the irritation and the congestion
there is all the sensitiveness to pressure we find in any other
part where Bell. is indicated; sensitive to a jar. Irritable state
OF THE MIND, irritable state of the whole nervous system. "Tenesmus
of the bladder. After passing urine sits and strains," in torment.
The urine is diminished, bloody, sometimes pure blood, or little
blood clots. A considerable quantity of blood in the bladder comes
away in little clots. "The urine looks as if mixed with brick dust,
or streaks. Strongly acid." There is a spasmodic retention of urine
and there is involuntary passing of urine. Dribbling of urine in
brain troubles. During sleep, dribbling of urine. Dreams that he is
passing urine, and involuntarily passed it. Retention of urine
after shock, or from congestion of the brain, or after confinement.
Bladder full; great pain; great sensitiveness. Involuntary
dribbling while standing and walking; or sometimes from mere motion
the urine spurts. The urging is violent and sudden. When a little
urine has collected in the bladder, he has a sudden, painful
urging. Much of the trouble is at the neck of the bladder, and it
is spasmodic. He feels the spasmodic clutching. At the time of the
urging, and at other times, he has spasm of the neck of the
bladder, from shock, from cold, from anxiety, from mental
disturbances. When becoming old, or chilled, or in very cold air,
women lose their urine, like DULCAMARA and CAUST. Starts in sleep,
and wets bed. Dreams of a fright, which causes a starting, and she
wets the bed. On going to sleep, a sudden electric shock goes
through the whole body, and she wets the bed. Bell. is rich with
such strange little peculiarities; but it only shows the general
spasmodic condition and the general irritability of the whole
Belladonna constitution. We see those strange conditions and
states, the irritability in all parts of the body, especially where
there are sphincters, where there are circular fibres clutching in
the neck of the bladder; clutching at the mouth of the vagina;
constriction of tubes. Constriction of the uterus. Here we see a
special marked feature of it, in the neck of the
bladder.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-FEMALE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It has more troubles
in the woman than in the man; that is in the symptoms and
conditions in relation to the female sexual organs, and to
parturition, and to the breasts, and during the period of
gestation, there are many conditions where Belladonna will be
needed. It is really an important remedy for the nervous sensitive
woman, the woman of irritable fiber.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the male
genitals, we have scarcely any important symptoms; but with the
female, there are many and some very distressing ones. They have
symptoms of great suffering, of great excitability. The parts are
sensitive; the uterus and ovaries are congested, sore to touch,
sensitive to jar. Irritable uterus, until it has become enlarged
and painful, and sore to the touch. Sometimes it remains in this
state after parturition. Or, after every menstrual period, it is a
little larger, arid remains. It does not return to its normal
state, but remains congested, and the woman feels all through the
interim as if she was menstruating. Bruised feeling; sensitive to a
jar. The flow is copious and clotted. But the most striking feature
here is the uterine haemorrhagia. Uterine haemorrhagia from
congestion, with spasms, with great sensitiveness. The uterus
contracts with violence, hence, a spasmodic contraction. Great
soreness, with a COPIOUS FLOW OF BRIGHT RED FLUID MIXED WITH CLOTS,
IS THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE BELLADONNA FLOW. It is like SABINA in
that respect. Those two medicines have that in a high grade. The
uterus fills with a clot, and then comes a contraction like a labor
pain and expels it; for a while a copious flow of fluid; and then
contractions like labor pains come on again, expelling the clots,
and then comes the flow. The blood clots soon and the haemorrhagia
is attended with great exhaustion. Now this occurs almost without
any provocation. This haemorrhagia occurs also in connection with
abortion. Belladonna is a great remedy to check the haemorrhagia in
connection with abortion or from any cause whatever where the
symptoms of sensitiveness are present. Sensitive to touch,
sensitive to a jar; the patient herself is in that state of
irritable sensitiveness, great nervous excitement manifested both
when awake and in sleep; often with fever. Haemorrhagia, with
febrile conditions, but usually the haemorrhagia takes the place of
the fever, and commonly if there is haemorrhagia, it will relieve
the fever.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It is also a great
remedy for haemorrhagia after confinement. THE BLOOD FEELS HOT.
Haemorrhagia, with hour-glass contraction. It is not an uncommon
thing for the placenta to be grasped in its middle by a contraction
like an hour-glass tearing it loose here and there, and from below
comes the bleeding; a copious flow of blood. Bell. relieves this
hour-glass contraction,</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It has also the most
violent dysmenorrhoea. Pains like labor-pains. Spasmodic
labor-pains. Circular contractions are the commonest forms in Bell.
All of the fibres should take part uniformly and do their work
uniformly, and thereby gradually bring to bear a tightening upon
the contents. In Bell. it is just like a cord going around the body
of the uterus, tightening it, and it interferes with labor. That is
the way it is in its dysmenorrhoea. Violent contraction of the
circular fibres, and hence, a woman will often describe it as
feeling as if the uterus was clutched with a string. As if, it were
tightened. Bell. is rich in spasmodic conditions, in haemorrhagic
conditions, in states of irritation, and in soreness, and the parts
are sensitive to pain, and the woman herself is dreadfully wrought
up and shocked by pain. In addition to that, pains in the ovary.
Belladonna acts in many instances on the right side. It is common
for the right ovary to be more painful than the left, or the right
to be entirely affected and the left not at all, in, Belladonna. So
if is with the right side of the throat. So it is sometimes in the
right side of the body. "Pains in the ovaries with the appearance
of the menses. Pains in the pelvic region, which come on suddenly,
and cease as suddenly." The characteristic Belladonna pains come on
suddenly, sometimes stay a few seconds, sometimes a few minutes,
and leave suddenly. Pains from uterine congestion. Acute
inflammation of the uterus. "Enlargement of the uterus, and
periodically spasmodic bearing down." It has a relaxation in the
parts as well. The uterus has been congested and is enlarged, and
heavy, and the little suspensory attachments have become relaxed,
and tired, and weak, and have stretched and elongated, and the
already distended and overweighted uterus keeps pulling on them,
and this creates the sensation that women so often describe, a
bearing-down sensation as if the uterus would escape. It is
sometimes described as a funnelling sensation. These are the
expressions of women when they suffer from prolapsus. That
relaxation is common in a great number that have been poisoned with
ERGOT. The uterus comes down and is partly exposed between the
labiae. Prolapsus as if the whole inner parts were coming out is a
common feature, and with this, she is worse from a jar. There is a
great sensitiveness in the parts. There is a great soreness in the
uterus, and a sensation of heaviness. I have seen women sit with
their limbs wide apart, so sensitive is the neck of the uterus that
is protruding from the vulva. "Must sit; cannot lie down." Many of
the Bell. cases cannot lie down, because of the stretching of the
abdominal muscles. When they lie down, they must draw up the limbs
to relax those muscles. Must sit, or take a flexed posture. Great
sensitiveness in the parts. Pressing and urging towards the
genitals. There are all sorts of positions, and aggravations, and
ameliorations in Belladonna, in accordance with what particular
muscles are involved. Some patients can lie better than they can
sit. Almost all are worse standing. Some are made better by sitting
with the limbs wide apart. Most are aggravated by bending forward
too much. Sitting in a chair she cannot bend forward too much,
neither can she bend backwards without increasing the suffering. So
sensitive, and so much swelling in these parts. She is worse from
motion, worse from jar, worse from excitement, worse from the
slamming of the door, because that makes the muscles twitch. All
this illustrates how sensitive the irritated parts are. Then in the
external and internal genitals and ovaries, there is burning, and
twitching, and much heat. Often tearing pains; the tearing pains
are generally an exaggeration of those clutchings and
constrictions, and such are known as spasms especially of the
circular fibres.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Belladonna is well
suited to pregnant women who are extremely sensitive, who are
plethoric, who have congestion from taking cold, who have soreness,
where there is threatened abortion, or during or after abortion
when there are haemorrhages. Then again Bell. is useful in
red-faced plethoric, vigorous women who have married late in life
and become pregnant, and when the day of delivery comes the
muscular fibres are in a state of tension. The uterus will not
relax. She is flushed and has heat, and is in a state of
excitement, sensitive to touch, sensitive to jar. Relaxation will
soon follow. It is not to be expected that she will have an easy
labor, because women who marry at 28 or 30, or later, suffer from
prolonged labor.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There is one strong
feature of the haemorrhages, and of the discharges; the flow of
blood feels hot. During confinement gushes of blood that feel hot.
After abortion, gushes of blood that feel hot. A lochial discharge
that feels hot, along with the sensitiveness and soreness of the
parts. Tenderness to pressure. There are inflammatory conditions of
the breasts accompanying confinement. Milk fever. When the breasts
become red, extremely sensitive to touch. She cannot turn over in
bed; she cannot have the bed jarred, the face is flushed, and the
carotids are throbbing; there is fever; the sensitivity is aroused
throughout the economy. Great induration; hard as a stone. Bell.
will stop the pain in the breast in a few hours. It will stop that
congestion, and will relieve all suffering. When the mammary glands
are inflamed without any general symptoms, but merely an
inflammation of the glands give PHYTOLACCA.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">LARYNX AND
TRACHEA</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Inflammation of the
larynx. There is that clutching again, and choking. It begins with
a rawness in the throat, a smarting and scraping, and the formation
of a little mucus. After much scraping and hawking, it extends up
the throat a little; but before he begins to cough, it is quite
dry. There is smarting, and loss of voice. As soon as he attempts
to go into a sleep, that clutch comes on and wakes him up.
Hoarseness and rawness and clutching in the throat. Laryngitis with
sensitiveness. "Sudden attacks of hoarseness;" every motion, or the
slightest attempt to talk, the slightest effort to move the larynx
or to touch it causes suffering. Moving the head backward, or
moving the head from side to side, causes pain and cough.
Swallowing aggravates. As the bolus goes down behind the larynx he
feels a great big sore place, it is the larynx. The voice changes.
One minute it is one key, and in another it changes. Sometimes it
is hoarse and sometimes it is squeaky. And then, there is complete
loss of voice, unable to utter a sound. "Croup-like spasms in the
larynx. Spasm of the glottis. All the symptoms of croup," but no
membrane. It is simply a dry, denuded larynx, with rawness and
scraping; an inflamed condition. And this is the form of the acute
laryngitis; it comes on very suddenly. His respiration is short,
rapid and painful. Often asthmatic. Asthmatic condition, with
spasmodic breathing. And again, these symptoms seem to involve the
whole chest. Oppression of the chest. Asthma in hot damp
weather.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">COUGH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Belladonna cough
comes on from clutching in the larynx. As if a little speck of
something had crept into the larynx; a little dust, or a little
food, or a drop of water had gotten into the larynx, and he coughs.
"Dry, spasmodic cough." An intense cough. Cough at night. Cough
when lying down, more at night than in the daytime. The cough is
spasmodic, barking, and short. It is a remedy for whooping cough,
with spasms of the larynx, which cause the whoop, and difficulty of
breathing. Finally, after long coughing, the expectoration of a
little blood, or a little thin white mucus, is the result of the
violent turmoil going on in the air passages from coughing. The
Belladonna cough is peculiar. As soon as its great violence and the
great effort have raised a little mucus, he gets peace for a little
while, and stops coughing. But during the restful period the larynx
and the trachea and the air passages grow dryer and dryer, and
finally they commence to tickle, and then comes on the spasm, as if
all the air passages were taking part in it, and the whoop and the
gagging, and sometimes vomiting. Then he gets up a little mucus and
the cough subsides. Another little interval and he has another
spell. That is the way its goes on, like whooping cough, but during
all of the interim there is constant dryness. Hence, the cough is
called paroxysmal.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">CHEST</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Tightness in the
chest. Painfulness in the chest. Soreness in the chest. In Bell.
the child will cry the instant it feels that urging to cough,
because it knows what a great suffering is going to take place. The
chest is so painful; the child dreads the cough and screams. By the
child's cry, we know that it is going to have a coughing spell.
Just like BRY., HEPAR and PHOS., which have that feature more than
other remedies. There is burning in the chest; violent congestion
in the chest. With all of these chest complaints there is that dry,
harassing, spasmodic cough; worse at night.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This remedy cures
pneumonia and pleurisy. I am sure every one here could picture a
Belladonna pneumonia, or a Belladonna pleurisy. I am sure you know
the PATIENT so well that I need not describe the patient, the head,
the congestion, the red face, or the burning; but in pleurisy, I
will tell you its secret. Bell. prefers the right side. Great pain;
extreme soreness of the part; CANNOT LIE ON IT; WORSE FROM THE JAR
OF THE BED-and you have the Bell, pleurisy. BRY. also prefers the
right side, but the BRY. patient must lie on that side; must have
pressure, and is not so sensitive to a jar; he has not the intense
heat, he has not the great throbbing, and the burning. Every kind
of sickness that you go to you have to individualize in that way.
There is no other way to practice Homeopathy.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Remember, with all
the inflammatory conditions there will be throbbing, heat, redness,
burning, soreness to touch, and sensitiveness to a jar. With Bell.
it means he cannot lie on the inflamed part; while with BRY. he is
ameliorated from lying on the inflamed part.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Throbbing in all the
arteries. Great congestion. Vascular excitement. These are present
with all the congestions, and inflammations.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">EXTREMITIES</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Belladonna cures
inflammatory rheumatism, when all the joints are swollen, or a
great number of them, and they are hot, red, and burn. We have in
the rheumatism the heat, redness and burning running through; with
the same sensitiveness of the whole patient, and a sensitiveness of
the joints to the jar of the bed. He wants to lie perfectly still,
is very much worse from motion and has considerable fever.
Sometimes when the fever in inflammatory rheumatism runs pretty
high there is delirium. But the striking features are the swelling
of the joints with the redness, and great sensitiveness to motion
and to a jar. It is especially suitable to those that are very
sensitive to cold, which cannot bear the least uncovering, cannot
bear a draft, very sensitive to the motion of the covers, and
ameliorated by heat. The very stamp and character of Bell. is in
its rheumatic state, like it is in all of its other complaints. It
is the PATIENT that has given Bell. that character in the provings;
it is the PATIENT that gives disease that character when he has it,
and it is only the fulfilment of the Law of Similars when these
come together, and the remedy annihilates the sickness.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Inflammation of the
joints, coming on from sudden exposure of that particular joint. Or
from a severe attack of cold one joint becomes inflamed. A trouble
that is localizing itself. It may be any joint of the body, for
Bell. affects all the joints. The sudden exposure to cold, in
plethoric individuals, is one of the most prominent causes of the
Bell. sickness. In chronic cases the taking of cold generally
locates, or creates, a disturbance, and increases disorder, that
manifests itself in the weakest place. Vigorous people take cold in
the nose, where they throw it off easily. You can often say to
sickly patients that "your cold now affects you in the weakest
place. If you have liver trouble, your cold will settle in the
liver," and so on; "but when you get well you will take cold like
other people, in the nose." Absolutely healthy people seldom take
cold, but we do not have many such, they are so rare that we do not
often see them; and the snuffles, and sneezing, and the running at
the nose are simply throwing off the cold of ordinarily healthy
people.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the limbs, again,
we have convulsions, which is a part of the generals. In all the
muscles in the limbs, and throughout the body, convulsions.
Children go into convulsions with head troubles, with congestion of
the brain, with irritation of the brain. Convulsions from taking
cold, in plethoric children, and the limbs are most likely to show
forth those convulsive efforts of the muscles. Violent cramping.
All the limbs are in a state of convulsive movements. Sometimes the
spasms are clonic and sometimes tonic. The convulsions in the limbs
are sometimes such as draw them up suddenly, throw them out
suddenly; sometimes convulsions that throw the body backward,
called opisthotonos, and sometimes throwing the body forward,
called emprosthotonos. The most of the complaints in Bell, are
ameliorated by keeping still. The drawing pains, the pulsations,
the inflammatory conditions drive the patient into a desire for
perfect rest, are aggravated from motion. The disinclination and
aversion to the slightest motion is common in Bell., and as strong
in Bell. as in BRY. Bell, is so sensitive in parts that the motions
of talking are painful; so sensitive that the concussion of the
voice is painful in the sore spots. A person with a strong voice, a
bass voice, hardly thinks of the concussion that takes place; and
much less is that of the female voice, and yet I have seen that
aggravation from motion, and that aggravation from jar so marked in
the female that her voice was like the pounding of hammers. In
inflammation of the uterus, and ovaries, and the bowels, she
refrains from talking, because her voice creates a concussion in
the sore parts. That only illustrates the extremes of this great
sensitiveness to motion and to jar. Jar is only an exaggerated form
of motion, bringing out that sensitiveness.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">If you will study
the nerves you will find the greatest array of peculiar nervous
manifestations, such as sensitiveness of the nerves, aggravated
from shock; spasms; various disturbances of the whole nervous
system; twitching; jerking; trembling; subsultus tendinum, etc.
Cramps, and spasms, and convulsions in children. Convulsions come
on with great suddenness. They come on entirely unexpected. In most
instances of convulsions in the long acting remedies and medicines
of the zymotic type, the patient has not been prospering in the
last days of her gestation; but with Bell. she goes on part way
through the labor, or finishes it, and little is expected. Perhaps
her face is a little too red, but she goes into a convulsion
unexpectedly, a violent one from head to foot. Congestion of the
brain, with excitement. Intense heat; everything is intense,
violent, sudden and unexpected. The pains sometimes leave in
confinement suddenly, and a convulsion comes on. But look and see
that all the sensitiveness that I have described runs through the
patient. The pains cease suddenly. The blood seems to mount to the
head. THE FACE BECOMES RED. Congestions come on suddenly.
Convulsions epileptiform in character. Bell. is not suitable for
those numerous recurrent complaints, even though the single attack
should be mitigated with Bell. Take any of these attacks; whether
they are convulsions or headaches, or congestion of the brain, they
are running down and become excitable, take on congestive attacks
of the head, go right to bed, and roll the head. You treat those
with Bell.; the attack is relieved. Take notice, I start out by
saying this is only one of a series. You may not know it. This may
be the first one. You reduce that one, and when that same exposure
comes again, that same attack comes back; but Bell. does less this
time than it did before. After two or three attacks Bell. will do
no more and you are worse off this time than you were before. When
it has broken the first one the physician should see that this is
one of a series, and that Bell. is not suitable. Often it is a case
that needs CALC., I say often, not always. All the symptoms should
be examined between the attacks, so that the child may be elevated
above these attacks because the acute remedy will do no more than
suit the first, or second; or third at most. It has not the depth
of action. It has not the length of action. It does not affect the
economy profoundly enough. It passes away after a few days; has to
be frequently repeated. The patient should be followed up and
watched in all these recurrent spasmodic and periodical complaints.
Bell. is not a good remedy for recurrent complaints for it lacks
periodicity, just as it lacks continuance of complaints. Even if
the first attack looked like Bell. the next attack would come back
just the same. Belladonna is suitable in those complaints that if
conquered have no tendency to recur; those complaints that end in
death or recovery. It will only MITIGATE those complaints that are
periodical.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">SLEEP</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Its sleep is a
congestive sleep, a stupor; full of dreams; full of violence. Wakes
with fright from a horrible dream, a nightmare. Jerks and twitches
in sleep. "Restless sleep". Moaning and groaning in sleep. Doing
all sorts of violence. Delirium in sleep. "Starts in sleep as if
frightened." In sleep sometimes the patient will commence to talk,
will talk faster and louder, the head becomes hot, and the feet
cold &nbsp;and he ends with a shriek. "Restless tossing in sleep.
Feet becoming icy cold in sleep. Head getting hot in sleep. Wakes
up in a fever, and excitement."</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It has symptoms so
much like a typical old-fashioned Sydenham scarlet fever that it
has been useful in scarlet fever. Perhaps it is one of the most
frequently indicated medicines in that disease. In some seasons, at
least, it will run all through, and the majority of cases will be
Bell. cases, with the bright red face and glossy appearance of the
skin. Bright red, intense heat, great congestion; after a short
time if Bell. is not administered it will grow darker. But running
through all this are those three words, HEAT, REDNESS AND BURNING.
Burning everywhere. The temperature I described among the generals
as being so marked, so intense that you will carry it with you on
the ends of your fingers for hours after you have touched a Bell.
scarlet fever. It differs wholly from the APIS case, which has a
rough rash. Bell. is smooth and shining. APIS wants to be cool,
wants to be uncovered; Bell. wants to be warm, wants a warm room;
APIS has no thirst, to speak of; in Bell. it is the exception to
have no thirst, generally very thirsty for water, little and often.
The intense dryness of the mucous membranes and skin. Coldness of
the extremities with hot head. In ARUM TRIPHYLLUM there is a
constant picking of the mouth, with suppressed or scanty urine;
pale surface, only here and there a little rash; the itching of the
fingers, toes, nose and lips will lead you to prescribe ARUM-T. You
remember the BAPTISIA case, with that mental state where he is
feeling all over the bed "to get the pieces together." On the other
hand, where there is no rash to speak of, now and then a patch
enough to make a diagnosis, or the diagnosis is made from the fact
of someone else having the disease in the family, the child is
swallowing ice water, but vomiting it up when it gets warm in the
stomach, who would not give PHOS.?</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">FEVER</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">So, it is at the
bedside we pick out the distinguishing things and see that these
remedies are not at all alike Bell. stands out with its heat, its
redness, its turmoil. Remember it has not continued fever; it is
not suitable in typhoid. Bell. in a night will bring down the
fever, will allay the delirium; but how is it the next night? On
comes the fever, and the patient is worse than he was before.
Simply because Bell. cannot hold what it starts with. It is not
suitable. It has not that continued feature in it. We are led to a
medicine that corresponds to continuous fevers, and such must be
selected when we go into the typhoid state. Our earlier
practitioners often only thought of what they saw at the time. It
was only after our school had considerable experience that it was
found that periodicity constitutes a symptom. Every remedy has its
pace, its times of aggravation and its times of amelioration. So it
is with Bell. Its time is 3 o'clock in the afternoon, commonly. Its
complaints are generally worse in the night. Its complaints
commonly start about three o'clock in the afternoon, and run till
three in the morning, or until after midnight. So that during the
night its fever is highest. The fever comes on, and rises rapidly,
to a very high temperature, sometimes 104 or 105, and runs down
again to almost normal; but not with a complete apyrexia. It is not
suitable in complaints with complete apyrexia, for that marks
complete periodicity which Bell. has not.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">SKIN</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The heat, the
redness and the burning characterize most of the skin symptoms. It
has a fine rash; not the coarse rash, but the fine, scarlet red,
smooth rash. It has inflammation of the skin, phlegmonous, a deep
inflammation. First bright red gradually grows bluish or purple, or
mottled; and in this, there is the heat, redness and burning. It is
not suitable generally for the erysipelatous inflammation of the
skin and deeper tissues, covered with vesicles, like RHUS-T.
Vesiculation is sometimes present, but it is the exception, while
in RHUS-T. it is the general character. RHUS-T. begins with
inflammation; it has heat, redness and burning; but whenever
RHUS-T. begins an inflammation just that instant it throws out a
great blister and it fills with serum. Almost any Bell. surface
that is inflamed is likely to throw out a red rash. In intense
fevers, where there are not scarlet fever or any of the common
rashes, a red, fine, glossy eruption is likely to come out. It is
not an uncommon thing in congestion of the brain, and in bilious
fevers, for this rash to appear, and it sometimes deceives the
physician into making a diagnosis of one of the eruptive diseases,
whereas it is a mere hybrid. The Bell. skin, while it turns red,
has such a passive redness that you can write your name, almost, on
the skin. As you take your finger and make a line on it, it leaves
a white line behind your finger. That was an old diagnostic phase
of scarlet fever, and it shows that Bell. produces upon the surface
that peculiar passive congestion very much like the scarlatina. So
we have in the Bell. provings a symptom that is even a
pathognomonic symptom of scarlatina. But we do not prescribe on a
symptom. Of late years, no homeopathic physician ever thinks of
giving a medicine simply for the purpose of bringing the pulse
down, or bringing the fever down. He prescribes for the PATIENT. It
is true that the temperature does come down, if we get the right
remedy; but to prescribe a remedy to bring the pulse down is going
at it wrong end to. One who thinks homeopathically never prescribes
to remove a symptom; but guided by the symptoms he selects the
remedy, no matter what follows. It is true the symptoms subside.
Others might say he prescribed to remove the symptoms, because they
subside. Learn to keep the ideal of Homeopathy in mind, and think
rationally; in order to do that you will have to rid yourselves of
a tremendous amount of inheritance. We have inherited the way to
think wrong end to.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Yellowness of the
skin from congestion of the liver, and catarrh of the duodenum."
When persons have been over-medicated with quinine until they take
cold on every occasion, and a sudden attack of congestion of the
liver comes on, with the great soreness, and the skin becomes
yellow with all the sensitiveness of this remedy, Bell. will cure
such cases.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There are conditions
that follow Bell. that relate to its chronic state. Where Bell. has
been suitable for the acute conditions, the congestions, but there
is that periodicity that I have mentioned, it has its natural
followers, and CALC. is one of them. In boys that are big-headed,
plump, plethoric, precocious, that takes cold easily, and come down
with headaches and congestion; school children that get headaches
which Bell. at first helped; very commonly if you look carefully
into the case it will turn out to be a CALC. case. It is so common
for CALC. to relate in this way to Bell. Now a days we frequently
find the dry, hacking cough in the hands of doctors who have given
too much LACH. Lachesis is commonly given to over-sensitive women,
and it produces many of those conditions; it sometimes cures great
troubles, but it leaves behind for weeks a dry, hacking cough that
keeps her from sleeping. Sometimes it comes on after the first
sleep, which is commonly about 11 o'clock; a dry, hacking cough
from lying down. Bell. will cure this old effect of LACH., the
nervous state and excitability and the cough. Bell. will be
suitable as an antidote for LACH., that is, for the acute symptoms.
CALC. is an antidote for the more chronic effects of LACH. After
the abuse of Bell., CALC. comes in as one of the natural
antidotes.</span></p>
