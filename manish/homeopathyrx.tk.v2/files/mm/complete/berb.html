<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">BERBERIS
VULGARIS</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Berb.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">When we have
finished the study of Berb. we will see that it is not a very
extensive remedy, but it is a very important one. Like BENZOIC
ACID, it fits into the gouty and rheumatic sphere. It corresponds
to such gouty conditions as do not determine to their proper
places. A low state of the economy is present; anaemic condition;
feeble constitution; pallid and sickly, old and worn out;
prematurely old and wrinkled men and women. They are too feeble to
determine the gouty deposits to the finger joints, where they
naturally belong, and the trouble is yet, as it were, wandering
around through the economy. Wandering pains in the nerves, and
nerve sheaths. The wandering, stitching, tearing, twinging pains
that run through Berb. are found in old gouty constitutions, and
that is where we get the greatest benefit from Berb. Its proving
would lead us to see it is similar to the wandering, twinging and
tearing pains of old gouty constitutions, in persons who are
pallid, and sickly, and chilly, where the deposits have not been so
marked in the joints; but where the twinging in the fingers and in
the toes are just such as are found where the deposits do exist. Of
course, in all of the gouty states we must look to the liver and
kidneys for pains and various distresses; they are centers of
observation, because these organs are more or less disturbed. And
very often cardiac troubles go along with them. The kidneys, liver,
and heart are more or less disturbed in their functions and we see
that Berb. takes hold of these organs. We have the uraemic state,
and the state of disorder that ends in these conditions. We will
have twinging pains along with kidney disturbances.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Irregularities of
the urine. Copious discharges, alternating with scanty discharges.
Light urine, and heavy urine, excessive deposits of uric acid and
urates. It is changeable, like BENZOIC ACID. These two remedies run
very much together, yet their symptoms are wholly unlike. We find
among these sensations that stitching pains are found in almost
every region of the body, and they are all the time changing.
Wandering and stitching pains; little twinges. As you sit by his
side and talk to a gouty patient- "Ow," he will say. What does he
mean by it? He has had one of those twitching pains. The next thing
he knows it is in his knee; then it is in his toes; then it is in
his head, all over him. Finally, the gouty deposits become
prominent in the fingers, and after the gout has determined itself,
then we have sore fingers; but these correspond more particularly
to LEDUM, SULPHUR, AESCULUS and LYCOPODIUM, where the disease has
become marked and has located in the joints. In Berberis these
twinging, tearing, stitching, burning pains are everywhere, they
never remain in one place, but are always moving, and they are not
often affected by motion. Whether he moves, or keeps still, they
keep coming. In a few instances we have pains aggravated by motion,
but a very few in proportion to the many pains in Berberis. He
moves many times, because he cannot keep still. He moves, because
he suffers. There are also many pressing pains. But the burning,
stinging, tearing, stitching. If you single them out in places in a
given joint, from that one joint they will radiate in every
direction. If it is the knee joint, they will go up, and down, and
every way; if it is the finger joint, they will run in every
direction. If it is the kidney, they will go down the ureters; if
it is the liver, they will go down into the abdomen in every
direction. "Radiating from a particular point," is a distinguishing
feature, and it puts Berberis almost alone for radiating pains.
This is such a strong feature that Berberis has cured renal colic
in many instances because of its well known ability to shoot out in
every direction. It cures gall-stone colic when these little
twinges go in every direction from that locality. We see these
twinging, shooting pains in gouty constitutions are associated with
urinary troubles, and with liver troubles, and we begin to lay a
foundation for the study of Berberis.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The joints sometimes
swell. "Enlargement of the joints." But the swelling is hot so
common as the pains without swelling. Soreness, lameness in the
joints, with these radiating pains. There will be burning,
stitching, tearing, and the pains will radiate and appear in one
part of the body then in another. "A pain in the heel as if it were
ulcerating," and then the pain shoots off in every direction.
Numbness. Lameness.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">As to the heart, the
pulse becomes slow. Very often, it is slowed down
astonishingly.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND-HEAD</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The mental symptoms
are very defective, that is, we do not know the mental symptoms.
There are a few. We know this, that the mind is weak that he is
unable to sustain a mental effort, and that he is forgetful.
"Defective recollection and weak memory. Terrifying apparitions in
twilight." It is not a strange thing for a child in the dark to
imagine all sorts of things, because they have heard graveyard
stories from old people; but with this remedy between the daylight
and darkness, he sees ghosts, imaginary forms coming round him
(BELL., LACH.). It has melancholy, apathy, prostration of mind.
Some dizziness. The headaches are of the same character as the
general pains in uraemic subjects, where there is plenty of sand in
the urine, red pepper deposit. The head comes in for its share of
these wandering pains. Stitching, tearing, twinging in the scalp;
in the skull; in the eyes, ears, back of the head. Burning pains.
"A feeling in the head as if it was becoming larger," is a peculiar
symptom; a puffy sensation. Always putting the hand to the head; it
feels as if he had on a skull-cap. It fits down over the brow, and
it is not an uncommon thing with such patients to put the hand to
the head to take off the cap. "Feels as if he had a cap on the
head," when there is none there. This symptom is not always
described like a cap on the head. It is convertible into numbness
of the scalp; many patients describe a sensation of numbness in the
scalp, as if they had on a cap. Sometimes patients will deny that
it is a sensation of numbness, and say it is just a cap. At one
time, I fully believed the "cap" belonged to two sensations. If it
was painful, I placed it under "pressure." If it was not painful,
it was supposed to belong to "numbness;" but I have now made a new
rubric, "the sensation of skull-cap," which I now think is entirely
distinctive from numbness; but they both have to be
compared.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Then the eyes take
on that same gouty condition, with stitching, tearing pains,
twinging pains, shooting pains. Shooting off in various directions.
There is one grand feature about Berberis, that it has no
particular direction; it has all directions. Most remedies have
pains taking a direction from one part to the other, pains going
from the eye to the temple, etc., but in Berberis, it cannot be
said the pains go to any place in particular. They are wandering
pains and they radiate. Pains in the ears of the same character. In
every part of the body, we have these twinging, tearing, burning,
shooting pains coming and going, causing the patient to scowl and
make a sharp noise.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">FACE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The patient has a
sickly look; face pale, earthy complexion, with sunken cheeks and
hollow, blue-encircled eyes. That is a description of a sick face.
Berberis has been very useful in phthisical conditions; and in the
pains, and twinging, and sufferings in persons who have been
operated on for FISTULA IN ANUS. When the fistula has been closed,
these pains will come if it is a Berberis case. The kidney
manifestations will come on, or the liver manifestations, or the
enfeebled heart, or these wandering pains. At one time feverish,
full of pains, with violent thirst; alternating with the very
opposite state. Prostration and aversion to water. Want of appetite
at one time; canine hunger at another. The stomach is disordered,
digestion is slow and feeble, and we have manifestations usually
known to patients as "bilious." Eructations that are bitter and of
bile.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">ABDOMEN</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The liver is full of
suffering. In the liver, we have these pains, and added to them
sudden stabbing like a knife puncturing the liver. Shooting,
tearing, burning, stitching, twinging pains, wandering from one
place to another. "Gall-stone colic." These pains with jaundice.
The liver seems to slow down in its actions, and the patient
becomes jaundiced. The stool becomes white, bileless. "Sharp,
pinching pains in the liver, which come suddenly and with great
severity. Violent stabbing pain in the region of the liver, taking
his breath away. Had to bend double." These pains last a moment and
pass away. In gall-stone, colic pains are spasmodic, increase in
intensity and diminish, but do not let up entirely. Berberis when
it is indicated will let the little gall-stone loose, and it will
pass through, and the patient will take a long breath and wish he
had sent for the doctor sooner. Anything that is spasmodic can be
relieved instantly.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">STOOL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Pains through the
abdomen. Copious, thick, mushy stools and these are yellow, like
yellow corn meal mush. Diarrhoea; mush-like yellowish discharges."
"Clay-colored." From what we have seen, it is not surprising that
it is clay-colored, that it is bileless, that it is white. The
action on the liver does that. When you have these symptoms
associated with radiating pains, and with wandering pains in broken
down constitutions, persons who are suffering from cold, who are
pallid and sickly, you have a Berberis case.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Then the patient
becomes constipated, but the stool is white or very light colored.
"Burning, stinging pain before, during and after stool."
Enlargement of the prostate gland, which causes a constant pressure
in the perineum. Pressure as if there were a lump, or as if
something was pressing down." "Tearing extending around the anus.
Herpes around anus. Fistula in anus." Now the surgeons nearly all
advocate that if there is a fistulous opening around the anus it
must be operated upon. Homeopathy cures such cases. I have not
operated on one for twenty years. The remedy that is indicated for
the PATIENT will cure the PATIENT, and the fistula. Above all
things, they should not be operated on. To close up that fistulous
opening, and thus neglect the patient, is a very dangerous thing to
do. Knowing all that I know, if such a trouble should come upon me
and I could not find the remedy to cure it I would bear with it
patiently, knowing I was keeping a much less grievance. Nor could I
advise my patient to have a thing done that I would not have done
upon myself. It is a dangerous thing to operate upon a fistula in
anus. It is a very serious matter. If it is closed up, and that
patient is leaning towards phthisis, he will develop phthisis; if
he has a tendency towards Bright's disease that will hasten it; if
he threatens to break down in any direction, his weakest parts will
be affected, and he will break down. Occasionally time enough
elapses so that the physician who is ignorant does not see the
relation between the two. But now that you have heard it, you can
never forget it.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">KIDNEYS-BLADDER-URINE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">And then the kidneys
and the urinary organs come in for their troubles. There is such a
soreness in the lumbar region, in the region of the kidneys, that
he can bear no pressure. He cannot step down from a carriage to the
pavement without letting himself down very carefully. A jar is a
great shock to him, and sometimes the soreness is so great that he
almost faints. Soreness in the back; in the muscles of the back,
and in the region of the kidneys; and this associated with all
sorts of disturbances in the urine, with excessive deposits. The
kidneys radiate in every direction. Pains run up into the kidney,
and they become worn out if he does not get relief, he will have
some serious disease. Hence, we have these symptoms. "Burning and
soreness in the region of the kidneys. Burning stitches, single or
several in succession, in region of loins and kidneys. Much pain,
soreness and tenderness in back, in the region of the kidneys.
Sensitiveness in the region of the kidneys so great that any
jarring motion, riding in a wagon, jumping from it, was
intolerable. After kidney complaints, a foul, bitter taste, rush of
blood to the throat. Great urging, with pain in the neck of the
bladder, with burning, scanty urine. Violent, cutting, tensive
pain, deeply seated in left side of bladder, at last becoming a
sticking, obliquely in female urethra, as if in its orifice,
lasting a few minutes." Now we see how these symptoms manifest
themselves. Sore, inflamed, sensitive kidney, one or both. And
then, the formation of little calculi in the pelvis of the
kidney-little stones like pinheads; and every now and then one of
them takes a start down the ureter to the bladder, and, oh, how he
suffers. Then it is that the pains in the kidneys radiate in every
direction. Pains run up into the kidney, and down into the bladder.
In the male, they appear as if they ran down the spermatic cord
info the testes, and he is a great sufferer. You will be astonished
to know how quickly Berberis will relieve this particular kind of
renal colic. Burning pain in the bladder; burning pain in the
kidney. "Urine dark, turbid with copious sediment. Urine very slow
to flow. Constant urging." The bladder becomes very irritable.
Catarrhal conditions of the bladder. Smarting, burning, stitching
pains. Many troubles, pains and aches in the spermatic cord and
testes in gouty constitutions. Burning pains along these
regions.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA
–FEMALE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Berberis especially
fits a woman who is tired, with a gouty constitution; though not
old in years she is physically tired, so that all of her domestic
affairs fret and tire her. Coition becomes painful, and she has an
aversion to it. The orgasm is delayed, or is entirely absent, and
she is prostrated by it. In all the affairs of her innermost life,
she is a drudge. Full of twinging pains in all of her nerves.
"Burning in female urethra. Burning pain in the vagina." A lack of
sensation normal to these parts in the woman.</span></p>
