<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">BORAX</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Borx.)</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Borax is one of
those domestic remedies that has been long used for local
conditions as a soothing substance and for a healing purpose. In
"nursing sore mouth" of mother or child, Borax has been used in the
families of old, in the form of Borax and honey, as a wash. The
extensive use that has been made of it would make the homeopath
wonder if the people had not hit upon something, and it is a fact
that Borax will rapidly heal up a sore mouth. It is not strange
that it does so, for Borax, in its proving, produces aphthous
conditions of the mouth, which extend to the throat and even into
the stomach. It cures where the genitalia and anus are covered with
these aphthous appearances.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Anxiety,
fidgetiness, and sensitiveness are prominent in Borax. He is
anxious about trifles. He starts at every noise, on hearing
unexpected news, from music, from excitement. This anxiety or
nervousness, this indescribable feeling that is within him, is
aggravated from upward or downward motion. Such a motion as going
up in one of our elevators nearly drives him to distraction, but he
is made worse going down. All complaints are aggravated from
downward motion. It has been said in routine practice, that in all
cases of sore mouth in children, when the child is worse from
downward motion, Borax is the remedy. When the mother is in the act
of laying the child down on the bed it often rouses up in its sleep
and cries out in fright. The anxiety may be better appreciated if
you will go to the top of one of these high buildings and go down
in the elevator. It is natural for every one to feel, with the
rapid motion, an anxious feeling in the stomach, a sensation of
falling; that is natural to the healthy man, but if you exaggerate
that intensely you have the Borax condition in which the slightest
downward motion, of even riding down hill or walking down stairs,
or, in the child, when being carried down stairs in the mother's
arms, produces a violent aggravation. All the nerves are in a
fret.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">We notice that Borax
has an intensified activity throughout the body; all of his senses
are made more acute. His hearing is intensified; he is
oversensitive to his surroundings, over-anxious. He has an
excitable spirit throughout. Riding down hill produces vertigo. On
nervous excitement, fear and apprehension. This is a strong feature
of Borax. It has many such symptoms, but the nervous elements
partake of this type. As we go through the remedy, many other
things will be called out; but this may be said to be the principal
feature of the mental state, and it is to a great extent the key to
Borax cases. "Anxious feeling during downward motion or rocking."
The diarrhoea will be cured when that state is present. Aphthae
will be cured when that state is present. The rheumatism, menstrual
troubles and numerous other complaints will disappear upon the
administration of Borax, when this key is present.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It has hysterical
manifestations. "Changes from one work to another." It has a
restless, nervous, anxious, excitable state that runs through his
body. The child screeches and screams when it is dandled and tossed
up and down. The motion of the brain, the upward and downward
motion, as in swinging, rocking, etc., makes the patient lose
himself; he hardly knows where he is; confusion and vertigo come
over him. If one rocks the child, it has an anxious expression of
face. "Very anxious on riding rapidly down hill." "Anxiety
increased until 11 p.m." That I have noticed in Borax as a peculiar
time of aggravation of the anxiety. I have noticed it in women who
had periods of insanity, whose nervous trouble and mental state
would keep up until 11 p.m. You will notice sometimes in insane
people that it seems as if they were possessed of the devil; and at
once a lucid interval will come and they will talk just as if
nothing had happened. So it is in Borax that a great change may
occur at 11 p.m.; this state of anxiety and nervous excitement may
stop at that hour. "Fretful, ill-humored, indolent" state increased
until there is a stool and relieved by stool. "He starts on hearing
an anxious cry;" on hearing an unexpected noise, on hearing
something drop from a chair to the floor, or if a door opens
unexpectedly. This is all in keeping with the nature of Borax. If
you compare Borax with other NATRIUMS you will find an astonishing
likeness in the nervous excitability; NAT-C. and NAT-M. Aggravation
from noise, oversensitiveness to noise and overexcitement of the
nerves run through all the SODIUM family. They are wonderfully
intense people.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"While engaged in
thinking at his work, strong nausea." Borax has many times cured
this kind of trouble. I have seen it come up in this way; from any
sort of meditation he becomes nauseated and excitable and must
leave his work and rest a little while, and then he goes at it
again until he becomes sick at the stomach and so must rest again.
With the aggravation from mental exertion, from noise, from
excitement, from downward motion, we get the mental aspect of
Borax.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">VERTIGO-HEAD</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A further
examination of the sensorium shows: "Vertigo and fulness in head on
descending a mountain or stairs." This is a form of the same
anxious feeling. This remedy has a good deal of vertigo, sometimes
constant vertigo, which is made so intense on downward motion that
he must sit still, and do nothing. It has many congestive
headaches, pressive headaches and much heat in the head.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There are many eye
symptoms. "Granular lids." "Lashes turn inward towards eye and
inflame it. Entropion." Granulation and thickening of the mucous
membrane of the lid; contractions and scars and drawing inward.
"Lower lids entirely inverted." "Difficult opening of
lids."</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Like all the salts
of SODIUM the nose suffers from chronic inflammation of the mucous
membrane, a catarrhal state, with copious discharge, and crusts in
the nose; stoppage of the nose. The whole NATRIUM family has these
dry crusts in the nose, and copious discharges from the nose.
NAT-M. predominantly produces WHITE discharge, and so does Borax;
NAT-SULPH. produces YELLOW discharge, and so does Borax; NAT-
SULPH. produces YELLOW discharge from the nose, even
yellowish-green. Borax is laid down as producing greenish
discharge; its characteristic discharge, which is a general of the
remedy, is a white discharge.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">FACE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The face of the
infant is pale, and clay-colored. "Children have small vesicles
around the mouth, and on the forehead." NAT-M. produces herpetic
eruptions around the mouth in all of its febrile states, and when
the patient takes cold, Borax is sometimes forgotten and NAT-M. is
thought of because it is better known. When the NATRIUM
constitution is present, then it becomes a process of
individualization to determine which one of the NATRIUMS is
indicated.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">MOUTH-STOMACH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Aphthae in mouth
and on tongue." "Aphthae on tongue and inside of cheek." This alone
is not an indication for Borax, although Borax is one among many
medicines when the mouth is so sore that the child lets loose its
hold of the nipple or bottle. Many prescribers give Borax on that
indication alone; but the constitutional state ought to be hunted
up, so that there may be constitutional foundation for the remedy.
SULPH-AC. is more frequently indicated. "Red blisters on tongue."
"Vomiting after drinking." This leads one to expect that this
aphthous state has travelled down the oesophagus into the stomach.
There are many stomach symptoms present that are likely to be the
result of some such condition. "Buccal mucous membrane highly
reddened." The sore mouth, such as mothers have and such as infants
have, can be cured with Borax. "After every meal flatulent
distension." "Constant vomiting." "Vomiting of sour slime." The
Borax patient with stomach aphthae will gag, retch, and cough, and
that is what is called a "stomach cough." Mothers say, "It is a
stomach cough," because the child gags and retches with it.
"Stomach cough with pain extending into region of
spleen."</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">RECTUM-STOOL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Little ones often
get summer complaints when they need Borax. All around about the
anus you will see the aphthous appearances. Great slimy stools are
passed day and night; the child keeps up a pitiful crying; the
mouth is aphthous, child is emaciating, and holds its head back.
"Stools; frequent, soft, light yellow, slimy." Quantities of fluid
like boiled starch are emitted from the anus; Borax has that as
well as ARGENTUM NITRICUM. There are also conditions of the rectum
producing thickening of the mucous membrane, with stricture,
growing smaller and smaller until finally a long thin stool is
passed, no larger than a pencil. This inflammatory stricture has
been cured by Borax.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">URETHRA-URINE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In this
over-sensitive child when the catarrhal state is general the urine
burns so when it passes that with the first urging (which causes
the child to realize it must soon urinate) it screams out; screams
with the desire to urinate. That is what it means when it says
"Worse before urination." It is not that the state of the urinary
organs is worse before urinating, but the child in realizing that
it must urinate screeches and screams. "Frequent urination preceded
by cries." The urine burns and you may know that the child must
soon urinate because it commences to cry. "Orifice of urethra pains
as if sore, after urinating." "Desire to urinate without being able
to pass a drop."</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-FEMALE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This remedy has
cured gonorrhoea. Wherever there is mucous membrane, you may expect
to find the aphthous patches. There is another feature like NAT-M.
and NAT-C.; in both male and female it takes away sexual desire; it
benumbs the patient, and hence the mind and sexual organs are in a
state of indifference.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Then we come to the
most striking feature of Borax in regard to the female sexual
organs; in the menstrual flow will be found MEMBRANE. Borax cures
the most violent forms of membranous dysmenorrhoea, when there are
violent labor-like pains before and during the flow and it seems as
it the uterus would expel itself from the vagina. The flow starts
slightly, but the same violent pains keep on, until the expulsion
of the membrane. I have known Borax to cure when the membrane was a
cast of the uterus. Such patients are easily startled from downward
motion; let that be your guide to Borax in membranous
dysmenorrhoea. She dreads downward motion, and motions like
swinging and rocking. "During menses; throbbing in head and rushing
in ears." "Pinching and griping in abdomen;" that word does not
describe it exactly, for it is like the pain in labor; "pain
extending from stomach." Pain like the stabbing of a knife in the
groin, and that may occur either before or during menstruation,
"Tired; sweat after midnight." But, remember, with such things you
must have the mental state, the nervous excitable state and then
Borax will cure this dysmenorrhoea. Another grand feature of Borax
I read in the next sentence. "Leucorrhoea like the white of eggs."
It has albuminous leucorrhoea which feels like a hot fluid, and
flows down the legs. "White albuminous or starchy leucorrhoea."
"Acrid leucorrhoea appearing for two weeks." "Leucorrhoea white as
mucus, without any other ailment." Now from this acrid leucorrhoea,
from the menstrual state, this false membrane forming and being
thrown off, it is no wonder that women are sterile. All these women
are sterile, all who have such symptoms are sterile and Borax has
cured sterility when this condition was the cause. You will find
routinists prescribe Borax for all women who are sterile,
regardless of the state. When a remedy is given for sterility, the
STATE must be looked into which is peculiar to the remedy given
such a state as that remedy can produce upon the healthy
woman.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Another feature.
Many times, I have used Borax when the mother could not nurse the
child; she talks about always having a little, thick milk. "The
milk is too thick and tastes badly." This condition of the milk
prevents the mother from nursing her child. This is a
constitutional state, and Borax, if given in the beginning of
pregnancy, to a Borax patient will so change the milk as well as
the rest of the constitution that the mother will be able to nurse
the child. I have a number of times, when a mother has brought
forth several children that she was unable to nurse, given Borax
and it has so affected the case that she could nurse the next
child. This remedy also has loathing of the breast in infants, due
to the fact that the milk tastes bad and not due to any defect on
the part of the child. You might think of prescribing for the
infant, but if you examine into the case you will find that the
child will not take the milk because it is loathsome. The mother
needs a dose of Borax, which will cure the child of its diarrhoea
and loathing of milk. "The infant becomes pale, nearly
earth-colored." "The child throws up its hands when an attempt is
made to put it down." If the mother was a Borax mother, the child
very likely is a Borax child; it is not an uncommon thing for the
mother and baby to need the same remedy; many times, I have
medicated the child through the mother's milk if both needed the
same remedy. Another peculiar feature is that when the child is
nursing, there is PAIN IN THE OPPOSITE BREAST. Borax is not
necessarily limited to the state of confinement; there is a
practical use for Borax among nervous women in all states of
life.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">CHEST</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Borax has cured
pleurisy that very much resembled BRYONIA, especially on the right
side like BRYONIA; stitching or darting pains from without inward
as if through the upper right lung posteriorly; the stitching pains
might make you think of BRYONIA.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">SKIN</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Wilted, wrinkled
skin." "Skin pale or livid." Emaciated; flabby child becomes
emaciated.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Children become
marasmic along with the aphthous condition; they cannot digest.
They vomit or have diarrhoea; aphthous condition that extends the
whole length of the intestines; involving all mucous membranes.
Oversensitive child screams from downward motion. The aphthae
involve a good many other symptoms; crying before urination,
because the bladder is involved. The aphthous condition and worse
from downward motion; the oversensitiveness to noise, easily
startled, anxious feeding, etc., are the most striking and
characterizing features.</span></p>
