<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">BROMIUM</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Brom.)</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Bromium is one of
the routine medicines. It is one of the medicines that the neophyte
will make use of for every case of diphtheria and croup, and
laryngitis he comes across; and when it does not work, he will "try
something else." All who prescribe on the name use Bromium as one
of their routine medicines; but Bromium is so seldom indicated that
most homeopaths give it up as a perfectly useless medicine. The
reason is that they do not take the symptoms of the case and
prescribe in accordance with the individualizing method. They do
not prescribe for the PATIENT, but for the disease. You may see
very few cases of diphtheria calling for Bromium; but when you see
a Bromium case, you want to know Bromium. There is one underlying
feature of the Bromium conditions, they are found especially in
those individuals that are made sick from being heated. If there is
a diphtheria epidemic and the mother bundles up her baby until she
overheats it, and keeps it in a hot room, and it happens to be a
child that is sensitive to being wrapped up, and one whose
complaints are worse from being wrapped up, look out. You are going
to have a Bromium diphtheria. It is indicated also in complaints
that come on in the night after a very hot day in the
summer.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Now, this is as near
as you can come to being routine in croup and diphtheria. If the
mother has the baby out in a dreadfully cold, dry day, and along
towards midnight it wakens with spasmodic croup, you know that it
is more likely to call for ACONITUM than any other medicine. But if
the mother has had the baby out in a hot day in the summer, and
that baby has been overheated, with too much clothing, and it is a
plethoric child, and towards midnight you are called up, and the
child has a red face, and your examinations reveal a membrane in
the throat, we will see as we study the remedy that this may be a
Bromium case.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">''Hoarseness coming
on from getting overheated. Loss of voice coming on from getting
overheated." A turmoil in the whole economy; with headaches, coming
on from getting overheated. That runs through Bromium. So it is in
the hot weather, and being confined to a hot room, and after going
from the cold into the heat. But after the complaint comes on, no
matter where it is, he is so sensitive to cold that a draft of cool
air freezes him; but he cannot be overheated without
suffering.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Bromium has running
through it a tendency to infiltrate the glands (BAR-C, CON,
CALC-F). The glands become hard, but seldom suppurate. They
generally remain hard. The glands of the neck, the parotid, the
sublingual, the submaxillary, are enormously enlarged and very
hard. The processes of inflammation are slow; they are not that
rapid, violent kind like we find in BELL, and MERC. "Parts that
inflame infiltrate, becoming hard." Inflammation with hardness is
the idea. It has been very useful in ulcers with this infiltration;
very useful in enlarged glands with great hardness, without any
tendency to suppurate. Glands take on tuberculosis, and tissues
take on tuberculosis. Glands that inflame for a while begin to take
on a lower form of degeneration, a lower form of tissue making. It
is very similar to these enlarged, hard, scrofulous glands that we
find in the neck; enlargement of the parotid and submaxillary. It
has cured enlargement and great hardness of the thyroid
gland.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Again, we have
emaciation, and when we see the tendency to infiltration it is not
strange that it has been a curative medicine in cancer and
tuberculosis. There is weakness in this remedy. The legs become
weak. Growing prostration, with tremulous limbs. Twitching;
tremulous weakness; fainting. In the catarrhal affections, there is
a formation, more or less, of membrane. Membranous exudate is a
natural course of events. A natural feature of the mucous membrane
is infiltration, so that the mucous membrane appears to exude
little grayish-white vegetations, and beneath them is induration.
That is true in ulcers; it is true in mucous membrane. An ulcer
will form upon the mucous membrane and eat in, and build beneath it
a hardened stratum of tissue. It has febrile conditions along with
these catarrhal states. Great nervous excitement. "Icy coldness of
the limbs." "Heat of the head." "Dyspnoea, with great sweating."
Croupy manifestations.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Running through most
of the complaints there is palpitation. Palpitation with nausea,
palpitation with headache, palpitation with various kinds of
nervous excitement. So weak is he gradually becoming that he has an
aversion to every kind of work; to reading. "Takes no interest in
household duties." Becomes indifferent. Very tired. "Great
depression of spirits. Low spirited. Sad and discouraged," Anxiety
with most complaints.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD-EAR</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Headaches from
becoming overheated. "Noise in the ears." &nbsp;Throbbing and
burning in the ears." And then the complaints of the glands that
are so closely associated with the ears. With ear troubles,
enlargement of the glands, the parotid becomes enlarged and hard.
Ear affections following scarlet fever, with discharges from the
ears. Pains and aches; inflammation; abscess of the ear.
Suppuration of the parotid gland occasionally, but it is an
exception. "Swelling and hardness of the left parotid gland." The
ovaries, testes, etc., are all affected by Bromium.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Bleeding of the
nose. Ulcerations in the nose. Catarrhal affections of the nose.
Much sneezing. Acute coryza, violent, with much burning in the
nose, and a sensation of coldness, as if the mucous membrane of the
nose were cold from inhaling cold air. It is useful for June cold,
with the first hot weather in June, or if the first hot weather
comes in July. Violent, coryza once a year, during the hot season.
Fluent coryza, with headaches, "The nose is sore, and the wings of
the nose swell. Scurf forms on it, with pain and bleeding on wiping
it." Rawness round about the nostrils.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">FACE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A Bromium patient is
one that is likely to have flushed face, especially those due to
acute Bromium conditions. "Flushed face." He becomes heated easily.
But this is entirely the opposite of the chronic constitutional
Bromium condition. That is true with a good many remedies,
especially many of the antipsorics. The old sickly broken-down
constitutions, those needing Bromium for chronically enlarged
glands, for goitre, for cancerous affections, will have the gray,
earthy color of the face. "Oldish appearance." It is a sickly face,
an ash-colored face. "Face ashy gray." Then again, we &nbsp;have
children that are plethoric, with red face, easily overheated. Of
course, when the acute condition is on and the breathing has been
that of dyspnoea for several hours or many days, then the patient
becomes cyanotic, gasping for breath, and choking, the face becomes
ashy pale, as it is in diphtheria, in croup, and in laryngeal
affections.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">THROAT</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Stony, hard
swelling of glands, especially of the lower jaw and throat." We
find that repeated in many divisions of the subject. Many of the
throat complaints that are laid down in Bromium begin in the larynx
and creep up into the throat. Some of them begin in the throat and
go down into the larynx; but the two are so closely associated in
Bromium that both are likely to be affected; so that diphtheria
spreads from one to the other. Diphtheria begins in the throat and
goes into the larynx. Bromium fits the most malignant type of
diphtheria. The membrane grows like a weed, shuts off breathing,
closes up the larynx. So severe are the cases that though he has
been sick but two or three days, and even when Bromium has mastered
the case, the patient is left with great prostration. All those
that belong to Bromium are of that type. Great violence; great
prostration. Extremely sick, and with deathly weakness. A great
many of the cures that have been performed in the throat have been
left-sided diphtheria, yet it has cured both sides. You will very
seldom see Bromium develop in cold dry weather; but in hot damp
weather Bromium cases come on; affections in the spring, and in the
fall and summer.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">STOMACH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The chronic cases
that will need Bromium are such, as have ulcers of the stomach.
Suspicious ulcers in the stomach and suspicious symptoms about the
stomach. Vomiting like coffee grounds, and vomiting with signs of
ulceration. Aggravation after eating; either vomiting, or
diarrhoea. Cannot take acids. Diarrhoea or cough worse after
eating, or after acids. "After eating oysters, diarrhoea, and a
disordered stomach. Worse from the slightest inhalation of tobacco
smoke. Vomiting of bloody mucus. Eructations." Foul stomach. Pain
in the stomach from warm things, from hot tea, hot drinks. It is a
common feature when there is ulcer in the stomach or when the
mucous membrane is about to ulcerate, that hot drinks are
intolerable. "Pains from taking hot foods."</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">RECTUM-STOOL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In studying the
stool and rectum symptoms, we find exudation. Membranous formations
pass in the stool. Diarrhoeic stool with membrane. "Black, faecal
stool." Diarrhoea; must go to stool after eating.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">We have running
through the remedy enlarged veins. These are found also in the
rectum. Haemorrhoids protrude from the rectum, burning. Smarting
day and night. "Blind, intensely painful varices, with black,
diarrhoeic stools. Blind, painful haemorrhoids," and haemorrhoids
that protrude. "Haemorrhoids during and after stool." During the
stool, the rectum is painful from haemorrhoidal tumors.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-MALE-FEMALE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Swelling and
induration of the left testicle (ARG-N., right testicle). Notice
the left-sidedness, the left side of the throat, and the left
testicle. Then, again, dull pain in the region of the LEFT ovary.
"Constant dull pain in the ovary; with swelling and hardness."
There is the same induration of the left ovary. It does seem
strange that some medicines single out more particularly the left
organs and the LEFT side of the body. Like LACH. in many instances
it picks out the left side of the body. A great many remedies show
a preference for one side of the body; the glands in this remedy
are more affected upon the left side of the body than the right.
"Swelling of the ovarian region before and during menses."
Suppression of the menses. Loud emission of flatus from the

<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">LARYNX AND
TRACHEA-COUGH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the larynx, it
has produced more symptoms than in any other part of the body. It
produces a raw, sore feeling in the larynx from inhaled air.
"Rawness in the larynx. Loss of voice. Hoarseness from
overheating." From too much clothing on a warm day or from keeping
on an overcoat in a room that is heated; coming out into the air,
he cools off. He has laryngitis. "Tickling in the larynx," keeping
up a constant coughing. Scraping and rawness in the larynx.
Scraping mucus from the larynx, scraping and coughing. It is not a
hawk, because that noise clears the throat. Every medical student
should go through all the noises he hears others make, and try and
observe as much as possible what feeling is accompanied with that
noise, so that he can put himself in the other's place. Each one is
accompanied with its own sound, and the instant you hear it you
realize the exact place he is drawing mucus from and just where the
irritation is. If you allow the patient to describe it, he always
calls it by the wrong name. The patient knows very little about
this part except that it is the throat, and if he is drawing mucus
from the throat, or scraping it from the larynx, he always calls it
the throat. But the physician must waive all that and observe as to
sound. So let each one go alone by himself and make all these
noises that he hears people make, and then realize for himself what
part it is he is scraping. It may seem ludicrous, but how else will
you learn about it? It is just as important to figure out these
sounds, as it is to figure out what a child needs by its sounds and
motions. It is impossible to get the symptoms and wants of a child
except by interpreting its motions. Every motion it makes indicates
something. An astute observer, one who has been watching children
for a number of years, will understand the child, and will hardly
have to ask the mother a question. He will know at once, where the
child is sick by what it does. The child is like the animal. You
never have to ask a horse or dog where he feels pain, because he
will always tell by his motions. So does the infant.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The hoarseness comes
on after being overheated. Remember that. "Rough, dry cough; pain
in the larynx." Jumping up for want of breath. "Gasping and
suffering for breath, with wheezing and rattling in larynx.
Sensation as if air passages were full of smoke." Now we have all
these rough sounds; rough breathing; croupy breathing; rasping
breathing-different ways of describing different forms of croup.
You cannot individualize a remedy by these because one child will
croup in one pitch, and another will croup in another; but to get
at the constitution of the child and the mother is the important
point. "Voice hardly audible." "Spasm in the glottis." In the
croupy condition, it is really a membranous formation upon the
inflamed surface, very often extending downward through the trachea
into the bronchial tubes, and producing a croupous pneumonia.
Bromium has that in its nature. But without any membranous
formation at all Bromium constricts the larynx. It has constriction
of the larynx, just like a clutching, a spasm. "Tickling in the
larynx, with irritation to cough. Scraping and rawness in the
larynx. Sensation of coldness in the larynx." That is a very
peculiar symptom with Bromium. In laryngitis, where the patient
says the feeling is as if it was COVERED WITH DOWN. I have heard
them describe it as if it was covered with velvet, but it feels so
cold. The air breathed feels cold, just like it was the air blown
off from snow or ice. Sensation of coldness in the larynx.
"Constant sore pain in the larynx." This means that the larynx is
painful to touch. PHOS., BELL., and RUMEX have soreness in the
larynx, sore to touch; but the Bromium soreness is commonly below
the larynx and in the throat pit as well. "Sensation as if the air
tubes were full of smoke." Some patients will describe that as
sulphur fumes, or as of smoke from tar. After the first few hours,
mucus begins to accumulate in the larynx and trachea, and a
constant expectoration keeps up, of a whitish thick mucus, and he
coughs and scrapes the larynx constantly, and there is no peace.
This is often present in laryngitis without any membranous
formation. Bromium is not given as often as it is indicated in
voicelessness, in irritation of the larynx, in rawness of the
larynx, because it is uncommon for persons to have laryngitis and
hoarseness in the larynx from being overheated. Many of those cases
would be cured promptly by Bromium. But where it is thought of by
the routine prescriber is where there is croup or diphtheria. That
was never taught by Hahnemann. "Much rattling of mucus in the
larynx. Inspiration very difficult. Larynx drawn down." This would
take place in croup, after the formation of the membrane. "Cough
hoarse, crowing, suffocative; breathing sawing, whistling. Spasms
of the larynx; suffocative cough. Membranous formation in larynx
and trachea. Croupous inflammation formed by exuberant growth of
fungi."</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">PERSPIRATION</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Asthma of sailors
as soon as they go ashore;" relieved again as soon as they are at
sea. Difficult breathing with rattling through-out the chest.
&nbsp;Bronchitis and pneumonia. Bromium is often the remedy when
whooping-cough is prevailing in the spring, towards the hot
weather, and membranes form in the larynx. The cough gets
immediately worse from dust. Handling old books from the shelf
aggravates. Sneezing, hoarseness, irritation in the respiratory
tract from picking up and handling dusty things. "Cough, with
sudden paroxysms of suffocation on swallowing." Bromium is full of
catarrhal conditions, especially of the breathing apparatus. It has
hepatization of the lungs; infiltration is one of its most natural
features.</span></p>
