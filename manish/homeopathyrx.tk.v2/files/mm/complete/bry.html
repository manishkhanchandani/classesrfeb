<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">BRYONIA
ALBA</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Bry.)</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Every medicine has a
sphere of action, a peculiar nature whereby it differs from all
other medicines, and hence it becomes suitable to complaints of one
class and not suitable to those of another. It is like the nature
of human beings, as they differ from each other, and also like the
nature of diseases, which differ from each other in character. We
study a remedy also in regard to its velocity and continuance, its
remittence or intermittence. The symptoms of some remedies come on
suddenly, with great violence, with great rapidity, stay but a
short time in their paroxysm, and go off as if nothing had
happened. Others come on slowly, are deep acting and continuous,
like the continued fevers. We notice the complaints of IGN., how
flitting and intermittent and unexpected everything is; we notice
in ACON. how complaints come on with violence, and in BELLADONNA
with what suddenness they come on. When we come to the study of
Bryonia we find it is a most persistent remedy; its complaints
develop slowly, i.e., SLOWLY FOR ACUTE CONDITIONS. Its complaints
are continuous, remittent, and only occasionally intermittent. They
increase into violence, but the violence is not the first flash as
in ACONITUM or BELLADONNA, and hence it conforms to a type of
disease with CONTINUED FEVER; to RHEUMATISMS that come with
gradually increasing severity, gradually increasing and involving
one joint after another, until all the WHITE FIBROUS TISSUES are in
a state of inflammation, pain and distress. It has inflammatory
conditions anywhere about the body, but particularly of the fibrous
tissues, serous membranes, ligaments of joints and aponeuroses. It
also affects the coating of nerves with its congestions, and these
gradually increase in severity.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">From the beginning
there are present the characteristic features, and it may be seen
that this patient is coming down with a Bryonia sickness. The
patient has several days of preparation. He does not feel very
well, is languid and tired, does not want to be spoken to, does not
want to move, and this gradually increases; pains begin to flit
over the body, they move around here and there over the fibres in
one place and another, and every time he moves the pains increase,
until they end in a steady and continuous pain. The parts become
hot and inflamed, and at last, he is down with rheumatism. The
complaints come on AFTER TAKING COLD, not the first few hours, as
in ACON. or BELL., but the day after an exposure he begins to feel
uneasy and he sneezes and the nose discharges, there is rawness in
the chest, and in a day or so he has a chill and comes down with
some inflammatory trouble, pneumonia or pleurisy. Its inflammatory
complaints include inflammation of the membranes of the brain,
sometimes extending into the cord; the pleural membranes, the
peritoneum and the heart covering, these are the most common; it
also has inflammation of organs. When these conditions come on
there is noticed, very early in the case, even before the pains
begin, an aversion to motion, and the patient does not know why,
but finally he observes that his; symptoms are made worse if he has
to move, so that the slightest inclination to move is resisted with
a feeling of anger, and when he does move he finds he is aroused to
great suffering, and that all the aches and pains of the body come
on. Thus we have the well-known Bryonia AGGRAVATION FROM MOTION.
This runs all through the remedy.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This medicine is
suitable in a great many diseases, diseases of a TYPHOID NATURE,
diseases that take on a symptomatic typhoid, diseases that start
out as remittents and run into a continued fever, as in pneumonia,
pleurisy, inflammation of the liver, of glands, of the bowels, etc.
It may be a gastro-enteritis or peritonitis, or inflammation of the
bowels, with the sensitiveness, the aggravation from motion and the
desire to keep perfectly still. Inflammation of joints, whether of
rheumatic character or not, whether from cold, exposure or injury.
Bryonia is often indicated in injuries of joints where ARNICA would
be a failure.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There is an extreme
state of IRRITABILITY in Bryonia; every word which compels him to
answer a question or to think will aggravate him. The effort to
talk will be attended with horror. At the beginning of complaints
you go to the bedside of a patient who has been grumbling a few
days; something is evidently coming on; the family meet you at the
door and say, "The patient is almost unconscious;" you look at him,
the face is puffed and purplish, he seems to be dazed, there
appears to be a sort of venous stasis all over the body, but
especially about the face; his countenance is almost that of an
imbecile, yet he is perfectly capable of talking, although he has
an aversion to it and appears to outsiders to ignore everything
that is said. This sometimes comes on apparently in a short time;
the patient awakens in the morning with a dull, congestive headache
and a stupid feeling in the head; dullness of mind so that he
cannot work, and this feeling gradually increases; such a state is
sometimes the forerunner of a serious illness. We find, when a
pneumonia or inflammation of the liver, or some slow insidious
inflammation is coming on somewhere in the body, but not yet
located, that this state will begin in the morning. This is
peculiar about the aggravation of Bryonia-its troubles commence
many times early in the morning. On waking, with the first move, he
realizes that things are not all right, there is a state of
stupidity bordering on unconsciousness. Those who have been
grumbling for a week or ten days wake up in the morning feeling
miserable, some time that night or the next day they have to send
for the doctor. If this is watched for a few days, a continued
fever is observed. Or at night a chill will come on, with much pain
in the chest, rusty expectoration, short, dry cough and other
symptoms that will be spoken of under Bryonia later, showing that
the trouble is going towards the chest; or the condition may
gradually increase as a congestive, dull headache. This will be
seen when congestion of the brain is coming on. Bryonia sickness
often picks out PLETHORIC subjects, those who are venous in their
make up, those who, when suffering with cold, come down with
catarrhal congestions. CATARRHAL FEVER may be covered by Bryonia.
This SLUGGISH state of the mind then is the state of Bryonia, not
an excitable state, as in COFFEA, NUX VOMICA, IGNATIA, but
sluggish, aggravated from motion, aggravated from being talked to,
wants to lie still in bed; very great irritability, which is as
extreme as that found in NUX-V or CHAMOMILLA. It also has acute
complaints aggravated from anger, from being aroused, from being
disturbed, from controversy. Following the early sluggishness,
there is later a state of complete stupefaction in Bryonia, in
which he becomes quite unconscious, as in typhoid. He goes from a
state of partial unconsciousness to one of complete
unconsciousness, as in hydrocephalic children.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In rheumatic
complaints, in pneumonia, and in typhoid conditions, when he is
aroused from this stage of stupefaction he is confused, sees
images, THINKS HE IS AWAY FROM HOME AND WANTS TO BE TAKEN HOME.
Sometimes he will lie and say nothing but that he "wants to go
home." The delirium is of a low type; it is not the flashing wild
excitement of BELL. or STRAM.; it is the very opposite; he talks
and wanders and does not say much unless he is disturbed. You
disturb him and he says, "Go away and let me go home," and if you
let him, alone he will relapse into a perfectly quiet state and
seldom speak. "Irrational talk or PRATTLE OF HIS BUSINESS,
aggravated after 3 p.m." Usually you will find the DELIRIUM
commencing ABOUT 9 p.m., and keeping up all night like the fever.
THE ACUTE MENTAL STATE you will find manifesting its symptoms ON
RISING IN THE MORNING, but as the febrile state advances and takes
possession of him the symptoms will take on a 9 p.m. aggravation;
those who have chill will have it at 9 p.m.; in those who have a
fever, the fever will come at 9 p.m.. If mental symptoms are
uppermost they increase and spread over the night. It has a 3 p.m.
aggravation. BELL. will begin at 3 and run on towards midnight, but
Bryonia will begin at 9 p.m. and run on through the night. The
aggravation of the CHAMOMILLA patients, who are also extremely
irritable, is at 9 a.m. Sometimes we go to the bedside and can
hardly distinguish between Bryonia and CHAM. because they are both
so spunky, but the CHAM. baby is worse at 9 a.m. and the Bryonia
baby is worse at 9 p.m.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In Bryonia there is
a key-note, which really applies to a dozen or more remedies, "he
wants something and he knows not what." It is a very important
symptom of Bryonia. It is a symptom that calls for Bryonia only
when the rest of the symptoms agree. You go to a child who is being
carried in the arms of the nurse and wants one toy after another;
you get the toy he wants and he does not want it and will throw it
back at you. When that case is looked into thoroughly it may be
covered by KREOS.; another is never satisfied with anything and
rejects everything he asks for; you look into that case and it may
be covered by CHAMOMILLA.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Desire for things
that cannot be had which are refused, or not wanted when offered."
"Apprehensiveness; fearfulness." "Anxiety in whole body compelled
him to do something constantly." There is a feature worthy of
consideration because it sometimes makes a case appear
inconsistent. It is due to his anxiety that pervades the whole
body. In Bryonia as in ARS. there comes an anxious and uneasy
feeling which compels him to move, but he is worse from motion, yet
so uneasy and anxious that he must move. There are pains so violent
that he cannot keep still, and yet when he moves he screeches from
the pain. So it is really not an inconsistency but simply due to
the great violence of the pain. Even though he knows that the
motion is going to make him worse, he cannot keep still, for the
pain is so violent. Early in the case he was able to keep still,
and found that, he was better from keeping still, and that the
mental state was better from keeping still, and that the anxious
restlessness increased the more he moved, until finally a reaction
comes and he is obliged to move. You would think, looking at the
case superficially, that that patient is better from motion as in
RHUS-T., but in RHUS-T. you find that the patient moves and in
moving he gets feeble, and when he sits down the pains begin to
come on again. There is the distinction between the two, and yet
they look alike if not examined into carefully. It is common for
Bryonia to be ameliorated from COOL AIR, and from COOL
APPLICATIONS. Now, if he moves, he gets warmed up, the pains are
worse, but there are rheumatic complaints of Bryonia which are
better from heat, and under these circumstances, he is better from
continued motion. It is another form of relief, and another of the
modalities. I sometimes wonder whether Bryonia has a greater
element of relief from heat, or greater element of relief from
cold.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Most of the HEAD
COMPLAINTS that are of a CONGESTIVE character are better from cool
applications, from cold air, etc. Yet there are some of the Bryonia
head complaints that are relieved by hot applications, and these
seem to have no accompanying cerebral congestion. So that Bryonia
has opposite modalities, but in all its opposite states there is
still a grand NATURE running all through, sufficient to detect
it.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In a damp climate
Bryonia is one of the most frequently indicated remedies, but in
the clear climates, where the thermometer runs low, ACON. will be
indicated more than Bryonia. Still further, south, the complaints
assume more of the constitutional state of GELS. in inflammatory
conditions. We know in the far north the sudden, violent cold
brings on violent colds like ACON., while here the complaints are
more insidious, like Bryonia, and further south. These atmospheric
changes should be thoroughly considered in relation to our Materia
Medica.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The mental state of
Bryonia is usually relieved from cool air, he wants the windows
open. Anxiety, confusion of mind, fear, etc., are ameliorated from
being cool. Sometimes the delirium, and the congestive fulness of
the head affecting the mind, will increase if the room becomes very
warm, or from the heat of the stove, from becoming heated, or from
warm covers. In children, this will be noticed, whereas if the
window be thrown up to relieve the stuffiness of the room the child
will sleep quietly. Such remedies as Bryonia, APIS, PULS., and many
others, come in here. If you go into a room and find the child
raging with delirium, turning and tossing, and the mother is trying
to keep the room warm because SHE is chilly, and you say, "Why, how
stuffy it is in here!" and you open the window and then notice that
the child goes off to sleep, do not overlook that; because that
relief was caused by something. There should be nothing that can
possibly occur to a patient, but that you should solve the meaning
of before you leave the room. Settle in your mind as to what it was
that caused it.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Fear of death."
Full of fear, anxiety, despair of recovery, great despondency. Both
mental and bodily quietness is required, that is, he wants to keep
still. Often he wants the room dark. It has complaints from getting
excited. Bryonia patients are nearly always worse from visitors.
"Morose." Do not cross a Bryonia patient for it makes him
worse.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD-VERTIGO</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Bad effects from
mortification." "Ailments arising from chagrin;" these are
headaches usually. Violent, congestive headaches that come on a few
hours after altercation or controversy, or little misunderstandings
with somebody that he cannot talk back to, will be covered by
STAPH., but Bryonia also has that. STAPH. is suited to irritable,
violent, nervous, excitable people that get into violent
altercation or dispute. If a headache comes on, such a patient may
need Bryonia. If in a chronic state a patient says, "Doctor, if I
ever have a dispute with a man over anything I come down with
nervous excitement, sleeplessness, headaches;" you do not have to
work long upon that case, because more than likely STAPH. will be
suitable.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Bryonia has
DIZZINESS; the dizziness is worse in a warm room. You will notice,
as I go through, that in everything of a nervous nature, nervous
excitement, and commonly the bodily state, the patient is worse
from a warm room, worse from too much clothing, worse from the
warmth of the bed, wants the windows open, wants to breathe fresh,
cool air. He suffers more than ordinary persons, from a stuffy
room. Persons who are subject to Bryonia conditions suffer in
church, at the opera, in close warm rooms, like LYC. Girls that
faint every time they go to church are relieved by IGN.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">We commence now with
the study of the head. The head complaints may be looked upon as
striking features of the remedy, because there is pain in the head
with almost every acute complaint. Headaches are associated with
inflammatory and congestive complaints. The mental dullness and
confusion of the mind is spoken of with the congestive headache,
and bursting headache. The head feels so full she wants to press it
with the hand, or tie it up; tight pressure, over the whole skull,
is grateful. The headaches are worse in a warm room and commonly
worse from heat. Sometimes superficial neuralgias have relief from
local heat, but a warm room or a close room is very distressing to
the Bryonia headache. Headaches as if the skull would split open;
the pains are worse from every motion, even the winking motion of
the eyes, the motion necessary to talking; and the effort of
thinking, so that all exertion of body or mind becomes impossible
with a severe headache. Must keep perfectly quiet. Sometimes lying
down and keeping perfectly quiet in a dark room will give some
relief. Light aggravates; if you think a moment, you will see that
the accommodation to light and shadow of a room involves motion; it
is said that the light aggravates, but even here, it is the motion
that is carried on by the muscles of accommodation. The headaches
of Bryonia are very commonly the forerunner of other complaints,
congestion of the lungs, bronchitis, or congestion of some other
part of the body; he wakes up in the morning with headache; if it
be coryza that is coming, he has the headache in the morning and
through the day he commences to sneeze; or if the trouble is in
some other part of the body, before the symptoms develop, he wakes
up in the morning with this congestive headache over the eyes or in
the back of the head, or both; it seems as if the head would burst;
better from pressure, worse from the warmth of the room, and worse
from every motion. Headache over the eyes, sometimes like the
stabbing of a knife, worse from the first motion. He realizes it on
waking, upon moving the eyes, with soreness in the eyeballs, with
bruised feelings all over. The motion of the arms, doing work with
the arms, as in various kinds of business that are carried on with
the use of the arms and hands, is generally accompanied by
complaints of the upper part of the body and especially the head,
so that one of the old keynotes in the time of Hering was
"complaints from ironing." You know that ironing is commonly
carried on in a warm room, it involves the motion of the arms, and
thus brings in two most striking features of Bryonia, so that this
key-note is no longer an abstract statement; it is not to be
considered apart from the general nature, but only serves to bring
it out. Splitting, violent congestive headaches; headaches as if
everything would burst out of the forehead. Pressure pain in the
forehead, fulness and heaviness in the forehead as if the brain
were pressed out. This fulness or congestion of the head is
accompanied by what was described as sluggishness of the mind, and
it will often be noticed that the countenance is somewhat besotted.
The patient looks as if he were an imbecile. The face is mottled,
and purple, with congestion in a marked Bryonia state. The eyes are
red and congested; he is listless, does not want to move, to speak,
or to do anything, because all these things are motion are efforts,
and they make him worse. You will see this is also true in BELL.;
it has all of this congestion and pressure; but remember Bryonia is
slow, sluggish, passive and insidious in its approach and progress,
while in BELL. the mental symptoms and everything in connection are
marked by activity. With the headaches there is more or less
burning, and sometimes throbbing. The throbbing is seldom felt
until he moves. After any movement, like going up stairs, walking,
or turning over in bed during the headache, he feels the violent
throbbing; on keeping still a moment it settles down into a
bursting, pressing pain as if the skull would be pressed open.
There are many other pains in connection with the Bryonia headache;
in the text, it is described, "tearing and stitching pains."
"Shooting pains," sharp pains. Some of the pressing pains are
described as if a great weight were on the head, but the same idea
prevails; it is an internal pressure; a sluggishness of the
circulation in the brain, a stasis as if all the blood in the body
were surging in the head. "Stitches in the head." "Splitting
headache." "Rush of blood to head." Threatened apoplexy. "Headache
after washing himself with cold water when face was sweating." That
is, taking cold from suppression of perspiration. "Always on
coughing, motion in head like pressure." The headache is so bad in
many cases of pneumonia or bronchitis, in fact in any of the
inflammatory or congestive conditions, that very often you will see
the patient grasp the head when he knows he is going to cough. He
holds his head because it hurts so from the action of coughing.
Many remedies have this, but it is in keeping with the general
aggravation of Bryonia from motion, from jar, from any effort. "The
headache is expanding, aggravated by the slightest motion; after
eating." The aggravation after eating is in keeping with the
Bryonia state in general. The patient himself, in all complaints,
feels worse after eating. It hardly matters what the trouble is, it
is worse after eating; the cough is worse after eating, the gouty
state is increased by eating. The Bryonia patient will finally sum
up the whole subject and say, "I am always worse after eating;" so
that it becomes a general. The headaches are often accompanied by
nose-bleed. "Obstinate headache with constipation." Bryonia is
particularly suitable in venous, sluggish constitutions, with
sluggish heart, poor circulation, yet apparently plethoric,
apparently rugged, but subject to gouty exacerbations from change
of weather.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Dandruff is common;
sensitiveness and great soreness of the scalp; worse from the
slightest touch of the scalp, feels as if the hair were pulled;
women must always have the hair hanging down. In the Bryonia
headaches, as well as rheumatic attacks, if he can perspire freely,
he will get relief. Bryonia is ameliorated in all its complaints as
soon as the perspiration becomes free and general.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Catarrhal conditions
of the eyes are found in Bryonia; it is not so often thought of as
an inflammatory remedy for the eyes when there are no other
symptoms, but eye symptoms will be found, redness, inflammation,
congestion, heat, enlargement of the veins, burning and smarting,
associated with headaches, with coryza, with troubles in the air
passages, bronchitis, etc. Sore aching in the eyes, the eyeballs
can hardly be touched, so tender to touch, as if bruised, increased
from coughing or pressure. Such conditions come with chest
complaints, with colds and headaches. "Soreness and aching of eyes
when moving them." "Pressing, crushing pains in eyes."
"Inflammation in eyes and lips, especially in new-born infants."
Think of Bryonia when gouty conditions have left certain parts and
all at once, the eyes are affected, tumefaction of the lids, the
conjunctiva looks like raw beef, so highly inflamed is it, red and
oozing blood. You find out that a few days before the patient, an
old gouty subject, had rheumatic attacks of the joint, and now he
has sore and inflamed eyes. "Rheumatic iritis, caused by cold."
Rheumatic inflammation of the eyes, i. e., in inflammatory
conditions and congestion with redness, associated more or less
with gouty affections. In olden times, it was described as
"arthritic sore eyes," which means sore eyes in a gouty
constitution.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Many of the
complaints of Bryonia commence in the nose; sneezing, coryza,
running at the nose, red eyes, lachrymation, aching through the
nose, eyes and head the first day; then the trouble goes down into
the posterior nares, the throat, the larynx, with hoarseness, and
then a bronchitis comes on, and if not checked it goes into
pneumonia and pleurisy, so that the trouble has travelled from the
beginning of the respiratory tract, the nose, to the lung tissue.
This is a field for the complaints of Bryonia. All are worse from
motion, all parts are subject to a good deal of burning and
congestion; more or less fever, sometimes intense fever; the
patient himself worse from the slightest motion and wants to keep
still; dullness of mind, pressive, congestive headaches; sore, lame
and bruised all over, often worse at 9 o'clock in the evening;
increased dullness of the mind after sleep or on waking in the
morning. The cough comes on with great violence, racking the whole
body and increasing the headache, and with copious discharge of
mucus from the respiratory tract.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Frequent sneezing."
"Sneezing between coughs." "Loss of smell." Bleeding from the nose
in these congestions, or with coryzas. During menstruation, there
is epistaxis. Congestion of the head is present at the menstrual
period. Epistaxis appears as a vicarious flow in cases of
menorrhoea. If the menstrual flow should be checked suddenly from
cold, nosebleed comes on. Dryness in the nose.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">FACE</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The aspect of the
face is important; the besotted, purple, bloated countenance is not
dropsically bloated, although it has the oedematous face sometimes,
but puffed from vascular stasis, not pitting upon pressure; swollen
and puffed, purple, with a doltish state of the mind, as if he were
drunk. He will look at you and wonder what you were doing, and what
you said; a stupefaction of the intellect; the eyes do not look at
you intelligently. When a patient is about to come down with some
Bryonia complaint, with a remittent, or with head congestions, or
pneumonia, or some other respiratory disease, the family will
notice when he awakes in the morning that he has that besotted
expression, and he says he has to make such an effort to think or
do anything, and his head aches hard, and is worse from motion. Or
the face is red and burning, "red spots on the face and neck;"
"hot, bloated, red face."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MOUTH-TEETH</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In children, as well
as adults, there is gradually increasing cerebral trouble, dilated
pupils, besotted countenance, and continual lateral motion of the
lower jaw. This motion of the jaw in a congestive attack is a
strong feature of Bryonia. It is not the grinding of the teeth so
much that I refer to now, although that is found in Bryonia, but a
lateral movement of the jaw as if chewing, but the teeth do not
come in contact, and they keep it up night and day. A great many
remedies have grinding of the teeth. When intermittent fever comes
on with marked congestion, stupefaction of the intellect,
violent-rigors, even to a congestive chill, the patient lying in
stupefaction or a semi-conscious state, without grinding the teeth,
yet wagging the jaw back and forth by the hour, Bryonia is often
suitable. Constant motion of the mouth as if the patient were
chewing, in brain affections of children; it occurs in little ones
when there are no teeth; but they keep up a chewing
motion.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In regard to the
lips and lower part of the face, that bloated, swollen condition,
the sluggish circulation, a venous congestion or stasis will be
found in Bryonia, making the aspect as of one long intoxicated; it
is not so marked as in BAPTISIA and is not accompanied by so low a
state, so advanced a stupor, as in BAPTISIA. Great dryness of the
lips; the lips parched and dry. "Children pick the lips." "Lips
cracked and bleeding." Lips parched, dry and bleeding, such as will
be seen in typhoid states, where the whole mouth is dry and brown,
cracked, parched and bleeding; dry, brown tongue. Sordes on the
teeth. In ARUM-T. there is marked picking of the nose and lips;
they pick and pick and bore the finger into the nose.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Bryonia has
toothache, worse from warmth. "Tearing, stitching toothache while
eating;" from warm drinks, from warm foods, worse in a warm room,
wants cold foods in the mouth, wants to be in cold air, but worse
from motion. "Toothache &gt; by cold water or lying on painful
side." Pressing hard upon the painful tooth ameliorates it.
"Toothache &lt; from smoking." You see how the relief from cold and
aggravation from heat go along with us; we shall keep reiterating
these modalities that affect the patient as a general state, and we
shall see as we go through that nearly all his symptoms are worse
from motion, worse from heat, etc. He keeps on telling us they are
better from pressure in each region we go over, until finally we
come to the conclusion that they are general. We may have in two
remedies the same set of symptoms, and yet they are all made worse
from the opposite things. Thus you see modalities indicate and
contra-indicate remedies. This is the studying of remedies by their
modalities, for modalities sometimes constitute strong
generals.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">You will not be
surprised to know that Bryonia loses his sense of taste, so that if
he has a coryza nothing tastes natural. Not only is there oriental
sluggishness, but there is a slowing down of his sensations, his
whole state is benumbed. "Taste flat, insipid, and pasty." His
intelligence is so affected that he does not know where he is even,
thinks he is away from home, and even his tongue is no longer
intelligent; so that something that is sour tastes as though
bitter; his senses deceive him. "Tongue thickly coated white." In
typhoid, in cerebral congestion, in sore throat, in pneumonia, in
all diseases of the respiratory apparatus, in rheumatic affections,
the tongue is thickly coated. "Dry and bleeding and covered with
crusts." Such a tongue is found in typhoid fever, a dry, brown,
cracked, bleeding tongue. When he takes a cold, the mouth becomes
dry. It is very common for the Bryonia patient to have great
thirst; he is apt to drink large quantities of water, at wide
intervals. With this dry, brown tongue, however, he loses his taste
for water and does not want it; dry mouth and thirstless like NUX
MOSCHATA. "Aphthae." "Bad odor from mouth."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">THROAT</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Bryonia has
nondescript sore throats, with stitching pains, with dryness, with
parched appearance of the throat, and thirst for large quantities
of water at long intervals. "Constitutional tendency to aphthous
formations in the throat," little white spots in the
throat.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOMACH</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Then we come to the
desires and aversions that relate, to the stomach, and they are
greatly perverted. He is worse from eating. The stomach has lost
its ability to digest, and hence he has an aversion to all food.
"Desires things immediately and when offered they are refused." He
is changeable, does not know what he wants. He craves in the mind
the things he has an aversion to in the stomach. When he sees it,
he does not want it. His intelligence is in a state of confusion.
He craves acids. "Great thirst day and night;" he wants cold water.
"Thirst for large quantities at long intervals." Many remedies want
to sip water all the time. In Bryonia the large quantities relieve
the thirst immediately. In ARS. the drink does not relieve, he
wants a little and wants it often.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The stomach
complaints of Bryonia are relieved from warm drinks; that becomes a
particular because his desire is for cold drinks, but his stomach
is better from warm drinks. In his fever and head complaints and
febrile states, he wants cold things, which often bring on and
increase the cough and pains, but the hot drink, which he does not
crave, relieves the stomach and bowel complaints. In the chill,
Bryonia often has desire for ice-cold water, which chills him
dreadfully; and hot water relieves. "Desire for cold and acid
drinks." Aversion to rich fat food; all greasy things. "Desire for
things which are not to be had."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">When patients are
under constitutional remedies, they need caution about certain
kinds of foods that are known to disagree with their constitutional
remedy. A Bryonia patient is often made sick from eating sauer
kraut, from vegetable salads, chicken salad, etc., so that you need
not be surprised, after administering a dose of Bryonia for a
constitutional state, to have your patient come in and say she has
been made very ill from eating some one of these things. It is well
to caution persons who are under the influence of PULS. to avoid
the use of fat foods, because very often they will upset the action
of the remedy. It is well to say to patients who are under LYC.,
"See that you do not eat oysters while taking this medicine." These
medicines are known to produce states in the stomach inimical to
certain kinds of foods; certain remedies have violently inimical
relation to acids, lemons, etc. If you do not particularly mention
the fact, and say, "You must not touch vinegar or lemons; nor take
lemon juice while taking this medicine," you will have the remedy
spoiled, and then wonder why it is. The medicine often stops acting
and the patient gets a disordered condition of the stomach and
bowels; a medicine that should act for a long time ceases action
and you do not know what the trouble is. Homeopathy will rule out
such things as are inimical to the remedies and inimical to
patients in general, or do not agree with a particular
constitution. To have an iron-clad rule is not correct practice;
the only iron-clad rule is to be sure that the remedy is similar to
the patient when you administer it, and the things that he is to
have are to be in agreement with that remedy. It is not an uncommon
thing for a patient who has been under the influence of RHUS-T.,
and has been doing well up to a certain time, after he has taken a
bath, to have his symptoms return in the form of a RHUS-T. state;
the action of the remedy stops right there. He must of course take
a bath, and yet it is true that some constitutional cases under
RHUS-T. must stop taking their ordinary bath in order to keep
themselves under the influence of RHUS-T. It is the same with CALC.
a bath will often stop the action. I only speak of these things to
impress upon you the importance of feeding and treating your
patient in accordance with the remedy; in accordance with a
principle and not by rule; do not have one list of foods for your
patients; do not have a list of things for everybody. There is no
such thing in Homeopathy.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The patient himself
in all the strange and peculiar things is worse from eating; the
cough is worse from eating, the complaints of the head, the
headaches, are worse from eating, and the respiration is worse from
eating. The stomach is distended with wind after eating, but
especially after oysters. Oysters are not, as a rule, a dangerous
article of diet, yet some are poisoned by oysters. "Worse after
eating or drinking." When the case is one of whooping cough, the
cough is worse, the paroxysms are more violent and all the symptoms
are worse a little while after eating, but later, when digestion is
finished and the stomach is empty, he is much relieved. The Bryonia
patient is ordinarily relieved from drinking, but if, when
overheated, he drinks cold water, all of his rheumatic symptoms are
worse, the cough is worse, and the headache is worse. He will have
a violent headache after drinking cold water when heated. In
RHUS-T. patients complaints are worse from drinking cold water when
heated. The headache increases into a throbbing and bursting pain
tenfold greater than it was before drinking.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Bryonia patient
is subject to hiccough, to belching, to nausea and vomiting, so
that disordered stomach is the general term. Bitter eructations,
bitter nauseous taste. He vomits bile. After eating all these
things are increased. In the stomach and abdomen, we have a great
many symptoms resulting from disordered stomach, or from taking
cold, or from becoming overheated, or from drinking ice water when
overheated. Disordered stomach; irritation of the stomach so that
he cannot eat without extreme pain, and this increases until the
inflammatory condition involves the whole stomach and abdomen, and
there is sensitiveness to pressure, and it can be diagnosed as a
gastro-enteritis, with the soreness and tenderness, stitching,
burning pains, all worse from motion; nausea and vomiting,
diarrhoea, tympanitic abdomen; unable to move because it so
increases the pain.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">With the exception
of the abdominal and stomach pains, the Bryonia PAINS ARE BETTER
FROM PRESSURE. The Bryonia patient with these inflammatory
conditions will often be seen lying perfectly quiet in bed with the
knees drawn up; lying with the limbs flexed in order to relax the
abdominal muscles; he does not want to be talked to, does not want
to think; every movement is painful, and increases the fever and
often causes alternation of chilliness with heat; high
fever.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Bryonia patient,
when lying perfectly quiet, is sometimes quite free from nausea,
but the instant the head is raised from the pillow the dreadful
sickness returns, so that he cannot sit up. He cannot be raised up
in bed because of the nausea, and if he persists in rising up the
nausea comes on more than ever, with burning in the stomach. With
every motion, he gulps up a little mucus and slime, which is
putrid.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">All sorts of pains
are felt in the stomach and bowels, but most particularly stitching
and burning pains; feels as if the stomach would burst, as if the
abdomen would burst. Peritoneal exudations. Awful soreness.
Sensitiveness of the pit of the stomach, and sensitiveness over the
whole abdomen. This is commonly relieved by heat, although the
patient himself wants to lie in a cool room. The heat of the room
is oppressive, yet heat applied is agreeable. Every inspiration,
every motion of the chest greatly aggravates these pains, so that
you will find a Bryonia patient shortening up his breathing instead
of breathing deep. He keeps that up until he cannot stand it any
longer, and then he takes a long breath that causes groaning.
Gastric inflammatory affections and disordered stomach, gastric
affections in young girls from suppression of the menstrual flow,
gastritis, gastroenteritis.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Bryonia has
inflammation, of the liver and many other liver symptoms. The
liver, especially the right lobe, lies in the hypochondrium like a
load, with soreness and tenderness to pressure, and he cannot move.
Every motion, every touch, every deep breath causes pain in this
organ, as in the abdominal viscera. The breathing is short, quick,
and when followed by taking a deep breath it causes pain through
the liver; it burns and stitches. With this, he has the disordered
stomach, nausea and retching worse from motion; spitting up of
bile. Stitching pains, sticking pains and burning in the liver.
"Transient stitches in right hypochondrium;" these are in the
liver. When he coughs, it feels as if the liver or right
hypochondrium would burst. Severe pains when coughing.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">RECTUM-STOOL</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Bryonia furnishes
many symptoms in connection with the stool and rectum. It has
constipation, and it has dysentery. The pathogenesis is full of
these conditions as well as many symptoms relating to the parts
themselves. In the constipation, the stool is dry and hard, as if
burnt. No desire for stool, but after going many days there are
passages of LITTLE hard pieces as if they had been burned. No
moisture about the parts, no mucus to soften the hard stools. Any
mucus that may be present will be discharged separately. Sometimes
the stool is composed of little hard particles looking as if
burned, at times scanty, again quite a lot, and then will follow
the passage of mucus, as if lying about the mass of faeces was
quite a lot of mucus. In most inveterate constipations, Bryonia is
sometimes, suitable. It has also a diarrhoea that drives the
patient out of bed in the morning; i.e. on first beginning to move
in bed he begins to feel nauseated, he is bloated and distended
with colic, and he has urging to go to stool; or a little while
after getting up and moving about the bowel is distended causing
colic, and he must hurry to stool. The purgation is sometimes
enormous, frequent, and no sooner does the patient finish than he
is perfectly exhausted, lies down like one almost dead, covered
with sweat; so tremendously fatigued he can hardly reach the vessel
the next time, and then it comes a gushing, copious, bilious stool.
If, while lying, he makes the least motion, he must hurry to stool.
Bryonia cures dysentery with all the tormina and tenesmus possible
to imagine, with pain in the abdomen; with bloody and mucous
discharges. In the constipation, the straining is often
ineffectual. He has urging to stool and goes several times before
there is any result. The stool seems to remain in the rectum,
although he seems to be compelled to strain; there is inactivity
and inability to strain. Ordinarily he has plenty of power and is
quite likely to have a passage, but it is so dry. Bryonia has
another kind of diarrhoea. It is like the yellow corn meal mush.
Just such a stool as this you will find in the typhoid patient, a
yellow, mushy stool. This is sometimes intermingled with mucus and
slime, sometimes with blood. It may be useful to the physician to
know whether this is in the typhoid state or in the form of chronic
diarrhoea. Bryonia has cured many cases of chronic diarrhoea where
this yellow, mushy discharge was present, and frequent; several
times a day, but more frequent in the morning. Sometimes he has
several stools in the morning that will satisfy for the whole
twenty-four hours, or only one or two in the afternoon and five or
six in the morning; during the night no stools at all, because when
he keeps quiet in bed and comfortable he has not very much urging
to stool; every motion or keeping upon the feet increases the
urging to stool. So that some would think of it as a diarrhoea only
in the day-time, and would associate it with PETROLEUM; but with
PETROLEUM, no matter how much he moves about in the night, he will
not have a stool, but will have all of the stools in the day-time.
It says here: "Diarrhoea putrid; smelling like old cheese." "Very
offensive." "Brown, thin, faecal stools." Sometimes chronic Bryonia
patients will diet themselves, eating only thin liquids, avoiding
solids, etc., and yet the food will come right through the next
morning almost undigested; lienteric stools. "Urging followed by
copious pasty evacuations." "Involuntary stools while asleep."
"Burning of the anus with every passage." This is especially at
night if he moves, but motion is more common in the day-time, and
every motion will bring on urging to stool.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There are plenty of
urinary symptoms in this remedy; inflammatory condition of the
kidneys; pinkish urinary deposits, uric acid crystals; urine
profuse. Whenever he strains himself in lifting, or any unusual
motion, there is pain in the kidneys, a rousing up of congesting
and long-lasting pain. It is a gouty constitution with kidney
troubles, so that after overheating or overexertion he gets pain in
the back. "Pressure to urinate and involuntary discharge of urine."
"Burning in urethra, when not urinating;" relieved by passing
urine.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-FEMALE</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There are many
symptoms of the female sexual organs of great interest. Painful
menstruation, dysmenorrhoea; pain in the ovaries at the menstrual
period. Every menstrual period is associated with marked congestion
of the ovaries, with sensitiveness to touch. The sensitiveness at
the approach of every menstrual period, in both groins, will be
spoken of by the patient, increasing as the menstrual period comes
on, until the soreness proceeds across the abdomen and meets, and
then the whole abdomen is painful during the menstrual period. The
uterus is sore, the hypogastrium is tender. Inflammation of the
uterus. Burning pain mostly in the body or fundus of the uterus.
The Bryonia patient is subject to amenorrhoea, or the flow is
suppressed upon the slightest provocation. If she becomes
overheated from exertion, such as from ironing or washing a few
days before the menstrual period, it will be suppressed, and the
next time she will have a harder time than ever. In young
plethoric, women, after violent exertion, these complaints come on
in that way. Violent exertion then scanty urine. Soreness of the
abdomen, but the flow does not come, or is postponed a good many
days after violent exertion; scanty urine and suppression of menses
in plethoric girls.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">From overexertion
and becoming overheated, threatened abortion. In inflammation of
the breasts and stopping of the milk flow in the lying-in period,
Bryonia must be consulted. In milk fever, pains, and swelling of
the breast Bryonia must be studied. During confinement a woman
becomes overheated and naturally perspires; just at the close of it
as the delivery takes place, if the nurse and the doctor do not
observe and throw more clothing over her, or at least keep the room
warm enough, there will be sudden suppression of the sweat, and
this will bring on milk fever and other febrile symptoms which will
need Bryonia. Threatened peritonitis, from such causes, gonorrhoeal
troubles, old rheumatic troubles, pains or aches, if made worse
from the slightest motion. If due to septicaemia rather than to
suppression of the sweat, very commonly a deeper acting remedy is
required. In inflammatory conditions of the breast, one of the most
striking things is the stony hardness of the breasts, hardness and
heaviness. Bryonia is often suitable for inflammation of the
breasts at other times; heaviness and hardness of the breast prior
to menstruation.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">CHEST-EXPECTORATION</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Then we come to the
respiratory tract again, which we have only hinted at, and here we
have a tremendous study before us. Very commonly the Bryonia
conditions commence with a cold; it may be at first loss of voice,
with rawness in the trachea and great soreness in the chest; dry,
hacking cough, as if the chest would burst from coughing. The
Bryonia patient sits up and holds the head, or holds the chest;
presses both hands upon the chest when coughing, feels as if the
chest would fly to pieces when coughing; pains in the chest on both
sides, but mostly the right side. Bryonia prefers the right side
when the condition is PNEUMONIA. We see a patient, who had first a
cold, and the cold has travelled down the air passages, with
hoarseness and rawness in the chest and cough; the cough shakes the
whole body, then comes a hard chill. He is now down in bed, and
when the physician sees him he sees the state of inflammation and
knows the meaning of it, and listening confirms the diagnosis of
pneumonia. The patient cannot move hand or foot; the pain is mostly
in the right lung, and he is compelled to lie on the right side or
back and dreads motion. Sometimes the pleura is involved and we
have the sharp pains; every respiration causes intense pain,
whether it be pleuro-pneumonia or a simple pneumonia. But we see
the Bryonia patient lying upon the side that is affected, upon the
painful side, in order to diminish the motion that respiration
causes; and every often he will have a hand under it to see if he
cannot hold it still. With Bryonia the expectoration is of a
reddish tinge, is rusty, and if you have this symptom and the right
side affected it is all the more strongly Bryonia. There are a few
medicines that look somewhat like Bryonia; take, for instance, a
case with high fever, intense heat, great excitement, and consider
the rapidity with which the trouble has come on, involving the LEFT
side and in the pan you see the sputum consists of bright red
blood, ACONITUM will be the remedy. If the liver is involved, there
is fulness in the side, stitching pain over the liver, and the face
is yellow, it is not impossible for Bryonia to be indicated, for it
has such things, but with pain very severe, continually going from
the front to the back through the right shoulder-blade, CHELIDONIUM
is more likely to cure than Bryonia. These comparisons may be
carried out indefinitely, but the study of Bryonia as to the
respiratory apparatus is a wonderful one.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">LARYNX AND
TRACHEA-RESPIRATION-COUGH</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">With these colds
that end in loss of voice, it has burning and tickling in the
larynx, constant cough. Hoarseness and loss of voice in singers.
Great soreness in the trachea, rawness and tightness in the
trachea, even suffocation, like PHOSPHORUS The Bryonia breathing is
panting and very rapid, little short rapid breaths, due to the fact
that deep breathing increases the pain, the Bryonia patient desires
to breathe deep, wants deep breathing, needs deep breathing, but it
hurts him so. "Constant disposition to sigh," but cannot because it
hurts him so. Shortness of breath, suffocation, asthma. Asthmatic
attacks from becoming overheated. Asthma worse in a warm room,
wants cool air to breathe. "Dry, spasmodic cough, whooping cough,
shaking the whole body." Cough compels him to spring up in bed
involuntarily, painful cough with difficult breathing, cough that
shakes the whole body Tough, difficult expectoration. "Cough
evening and night, dry cough."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A great deal of the
rest of Bryonia, as we go over it, is repetition. If you will only
read the text carefully and make application of what has been said,
you see the general character and idea of the remedy, you see its
image and you will fill it out for yourselves, if you have a full
text-book.</span></p>

aggravated on <strong>motion</strong>, when <strong>sitting up</strong> in bed. </p><p style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;">Vomiting <strong>after drinking</strong> the
smallest quantity, after eating.</p><p style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;">All abdominal pains are aggravated from the slight <strong>motion</strong>, <strong>breathing</strong>, <strong>jar</strong>, <strong>touch</strong>, tight clothes and&nbsp; ameliorated
when <strong>lying on painful side</strong><em>,</em>when<em>
bending double.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><strong>INJURIES:</strong> injuries from <em>blunt</em> instruments, from <strong>straining</strong>, <strong>sprains</strong>. <strong>Bruising pain.</strong> </p><p style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MENTAL PICTURE:</strong> Wants to be <strong>quiet </strong>and <strong>left alone</strong>. The concept of aggravation
from motion goes to the mental level too. Talking or any interaction disturbs
the internal stillness.</p><p><strong>THIRST/CRAVINGS:</strong>&nbsp; The <strong>thirst</strong> is pronounced. The patient is
thirsty for <strong>large quantities</strong> of
water. We may also see <strong>thirstlessness
despite of the dry mouth.</strong> </p><p style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><strong>MODALITIES:</strong> </p><p style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;">Aggravation: <strong>motion </strong>(coughing,
sneezing, breathing deeply),<strong> jar, touch,
</strong><em>warmth</em>.<strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;">Amelioration: <strong>lying still,
pressure, lying on the painful side, </strong><em>warm
bed, warm drinks, open air, cold applications.</em></p><p style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TIP:</strong> Bryonia and Rhus-t. are complementary remedies. We often observe that
after giving Bryonia, the picture changes to Rhus-t. especially in
musculoskeletal problems.</p>							</div>
