<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">CACTUS
GRANDIFLORUS</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Cact.)</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">PHYSICAL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Constrictions,
contractions and congestions run through Cactus. Determination of
blood to the head, and coldness of the extremities. &nbsp;Or
determination of blood to an organ, the chest, or the heart. There
is never an equal circulation of blood in the body; it is spasmodic
and irregular. Disturbed by contractions of circular fibres
everywhere. When this comes in places where it can be felt, and
realized by the senses, it is felt as contractions, as if caged in
wires, and this gives us the key to Cact. Where contractions cannot
be felt, where there is no sense of feeling, we know that it goes
on as a spasmodic condition of circular fibres; but these
contractions that are felt are more upon the surface of the body,
and in organs having circular fibres-tubes and canals. They
constrict, and this constriction is felt like a spasm. It has a
sensation of tightness and constriction about the head, about the
chest, about the attachments of the diaphragm, all over the
abdomen. Contractions about the heart that are tonic in character,
like a tight clutching; constriction. "Constriction felt about the
heart." These constrictions are felt about the throat, in the
oesophagus, causing a spasm; in the vagina, causing vaginismus and
preventing coition. In the uterus, it produces the most violent
cramps. Clutching and constrictions, as if the uterus were grasped
and held tightly, like a spasm. But at these times, when these
constrictions take place, there are congestions. "Rush of blood to
the part, with constriction." "Violent congestion of the uterus,
with constrictions. Rush of blood to the chest, as if the chest was
filled with hot gushes of blood, with constrictions, and
constriction of the heart." These peculiarities run through Cactus
more markedly than any other remedy. Many remedies have similar
things now and then, but in Cactus it is common; it is the nature
of Cactus to constrict, to cause constriction in places where it
has never been felt, and never been thought of. Constrictions of
the whole body, as if the body was held in a wire cage.
Constrictions of the scalp, of the skin, growing tighter and
tighter. Violent congestions that come on suddenly. Congestion of
the brain, with hot head, flushed face. At the beginning of
complaints, at the beginning of pneumonia; congestive chill with
hot head and cold body (like ARN.) with violent constrictions and
tightness, as if the head were pressed, as if the membrane of the
brain were too tight, as if the brain were covered with a tight
cloth, and were being screwed tighter and tighter. Uniform
tightness of an organ, as if it were being bound tighter and
tighter. But in tubes and canals it is a constriction of a
particular part, many times like as if tied with a string.
Constriction, like hour-glass contraction, in the uterus. It has
inflammations, congestions, rush of blood to the part, gradually
progressing to inflammation, and infiltration. Inflammation of
various parts.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It has rheumatism.
It is a remedy very useful in gouty constitutions; very useful in
acute inflammatory rheumatism, and in this instance the congestion
is in the joints that happen to be affected. And then again the
constriction, as if tied with a tape, or as if bandaged. Tightness,
tension, pressure, are involved in that thought. It has such a
prolonged determination of blood to the heart that the heart
finally becomes disturbed in its function, disturbed in its
tissues; and it has a profound curative action upon the heart and
even cures organic heart diseases, such as are produced from this
cause, conditions coming on from congestion, or coming on through
congestion in rheumatic constrictions, where the rheumatism has
left the joints partially and the heart has become involved, and
there is constriction of the heart. Various efforts have been made
by provers, and by patients, to describe the constriction of the
heart. It is sometimes described, "as if grasped with an iron
hand." It is only to illustrate the tenacity of the constriction.
In these rheumatic troubles when the joints have ceased to be
affected and the heart becomes affected with this chronic
congestion and enlargement, we have enlargement of the valves so
that there are murmurs, the head is hot, and the patient gradually
emaciates. Kidney troubles will come on; the heart grows weaker,
and then dropsical conditions set in, that is the course of Cactus.
Towards the last, cardiac affections, along with kidney affections,
with emaciation, and then swelling of the hands and feet. That is
the very nature of Cactus, and you will not find any medicine in
the whole Materia Medica that reads like it. There is nothing to
compare with it in the intensity of these symptoms. All these
things that I have described seem to turn upon these words,
congestion, constriction and contraction.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The pains in Cactus
are violent, no matter where they occur. They compel the patient to
cry out, and the pains are clutching pains, constricting pains;
they often feel like tearing pains; but there is always that idea
of clutching. Suppose you should tie a tape round a violently
congested organ, and tie it tighter and tighter. It seems to me
that is about the kind of suffering the patient has with that
constriction of a congested organ. Pains in congested parts; pains
in sore parts. Tearing; constricting, cramping, when pains occur in
the intestines they are constricting, but when the pains are in the
long muscles they are not the constricting pains, for it is not the
circular fibres then but the long fibres that contract, and we call
them cramps. Cactus produces some spasmodic conditions in long
muscles, but not to any great extent. In BELL. especially, and also
in many of those medicines that have this nature of cramping, and
constricting and contracting of circular fibres, there is
convulsive tendency. The violent congestion of the brain in BELL.
will commonly be attended with cramps in the extremities and
convulsions of the muscles all over, or in parts. Not so with
Cactus. Violent congestion and he grows stupid under it. Congestion
of the brain, first with very red face, then darker from the venous
stasis, and then stupor. He grows sluggish under the cerebral
congestion.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The mental state is
that of fear and distress, because of the intensity of the
suffering. The patient has never felt such suffering, and he does
not see what it can all mean. So much suffering, such
violent-suffering, such sudden suffering, such cramps, such
tearing, such constriction. When this constriction comes in the
heart, and about the chest, it makes the patient think he is going
to die, and he is at once struck with fear, and it is depicted upon
the face. He fears death, and it seems he is going to die, his pain
is so intense. But with this intense pain, he has nothing of the
anxiety we find in ACONITUM, which has a similar constriction of
the chest and constriction of the neck. The violent choking in
ACON. makes him fear he is going to choke to death, and the anxiety
is awful. It is not so intense in Cactus. Screaming with pains is a
common thing in Cactus. "Taciturn, unwilling to speak a word or to
answer." That often accompanies the Cactus state, which is the
opposite of most of the medicines that have such violent pains.
"Sadness, taciturnity, and irresistible inclination to weep. Fear
of death;" that is, he thinks he is going to die from the severity
of the pain. "He believes his disease is incurable;" it seems to
him that such suffering must end in death. That violent, irregular
action of the heart is followed out through all the blood vessels,
because the circulation is so irregular, is so spasmodic. He is hot
here and cold there. Heat in the head or heat in the chest. The
circulation is that of determination to some particular part. With
all the cardiac remedies, we have violent dreams, great excitement
of the brain during sleep, waking up startled and frightened, very
commonly with a feeling of falling. Dreams of falling. Dreams full
of excitement. These features run through Cactus, especially with
the cardiac symptoms.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">VERTIGO</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Vertigo from
congestion; face red, bloated; pulsation in brain. Feels as if he
would go mad. Vertigo, worse from physical exertion." With most of
the cardiac remedies, or remedies where the circulation and heart
are much involved, we have marked vertigo. "Vertigo; worse from
physical exertion, turning in bed, stooping, rising from a
recumbent position, and deep inspiration." Many of the complaints
of Cactus are disturbed by irregularities of breathing. Here we see
vertigo coming on from deep breathing. If he holds his breath, it
seems as if his heart would fly to pieces, it would go so fast.
Increased pulsation all over the body when holding the
breath.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The headaches are
constricting, pressing. They are all violent, with intense heat of
the head, for they are congestive. A pressing in the top of the
head as if the top of the head would be forced in; but this is
ameliorated by PRESSING HARD UPON THE PAIN. "Heavy pain like a
weight on vertex, better by pressure." Oftentimes the patient may
be wrong in the idea of pressure that is felt in the head. They
often describe it in the most marked congestions as if the head
would be crushed in, when the congestion in the brain can be seen
to be most violent, causing pressure from within out, and we would
think they would be better from some sort of support externally,
and yet they feel great soreness and feel as if the head is being
crushed in. Others with headaches feel as if the head is being
pressed out. "Heavy pain like a weight on vertex; better by
pressure, but worse from sounds, hearing, talking, or strong
light." This runs through the headaches. Greatly aggravated from
hearing voices. The sound goes through the head. The brain seems to
be sensitive, as if the sound were a material substance hurled at
the brain. Right-sided headaches. Pulsating headaches. Heavy,
pulsating pain in the head. Tensive pain in the head, tensive pain
in the vertex. A tightness across the vertex, as if the scalp was
being drawn tighter and tighter upon the skull. There can be no
doubt about there being a marked cerebral congestion with all these
symptoms. The eyes show it; the face shows it; the heat of the head
shows it. It has been recommended for threatened apoplexy, when the
congestion is so violent, and the face is flushed and purple, or
very red, and the pulsation is felt in the brain and all
over.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This remedy has the
violent congestion of the head found in BELL., but with BELL. we
have the intense heat of the body, fever heat which is not found in
Cactus. In Cactus it is only a moderate fever. The heat is in the
upper part of the body, in the head and neck. Fullness of the neck;
bloating of the neck. Feels as if the head would expand from the
pressure of blood in the head, but without any great rise of
temperature. It has fever, but it has these without fever. But with
BELL., when you have these pulsations the patient is intensely hot;
and he burns all over. There is some burning in Cactus, but not to
be compared with BELL. Heat in the head from mental exertion is a
strong symptom of Cactus. This symptom is found in persons who are
trying to break off from coffee and Cactus is often the
remedy.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EXTERNAL
THROAT</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The patient has
choking about the neck, as from a tight collar constriction;
tension of the skin and muscles everywhere. Choking about the neck
with constriction of the heart. Choking about the neck in hysteria;
globus hystericus; a lump or ball coming up into the throat, and
she constantly swallows and chokes, and she goes into cramps with
great numbness of the left arm.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">FACE-CHEST</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Cramping especially
of the left arm. Complete numbness of the left arm along with
cardiac conditions in the history of rheumatism and in hysteria.
The history of rheumatism goes well to fill up the Cactus case. The
face is flushed bright red, becoming blue. With weakness of the
heart, it is blue; blue lips. We need Cactus for a patient that has
constriction about the neck, with congested head, blue face, and
lips mottled, numbness of the left hand, constriction of the heart.
The left hand mysteriously weak, or is numb, tingling and crawling,
like a formication.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Another thing
running all through the remedy is its haemorrhages. That is not
surprising. Any medicine that has such cardiac conditions and such
vascular conditions will at times have more or less relaxation of
blood vessels, and it would be quite in the nature of it to bleed.
It has haemorrhages of two kinds. Haemorrhagia from vascular
relaxation accompanying cardiac and vascular conditions, and
haemorrhagia from violent congestion of a part. The rush of blood
to the head is of such violence in the moderately plethoric patient
that he bleeds from the nose, and hawks blood from the throat
Congestion of the chest so violent that he expectorates blood from
the chest. Bleeding from congestion, rather than from tuberculosis.
Congestion of the uterus with bleeding Congestion of the bladder
and kidneys, with blood in the urine, with discharges of blood from
violent congestion. In old cardiac conditions, where relaxation is
present in most marked degree, haemorrhagia from
relaxation.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">ABDOMEN</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Strong pulsations
felt in strange places, in the stomach, and in the bowels;
sometimes in the extremities, the feet and hands, as well as in the
head. Throbbing all over. Around the attachment of the diaphragm
feeling as if a cord was tied tighter and tighter; round the lower
part of the chest. This is a strange symptom; it clutches him so
tightly around the waist line that it takes his breath away and he
struggles for breath, and wants to do something. It clutches him
tighter and tighter. Cactus produces congestion of the bowels;
inflammation of the uterus. Gastric inflammation and with it the
clutchings.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">RECTUM-STOOL</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It is a remedy for
the cure of haemorrhoids; the relaxation of the great portal
system, and the lower veins in the rectum, the haemorrhoidal veins.
The veins are in such a state of relaxation that tumors will form,
and bleed copiously. Bleeding haemorrhoids. Constriction of the
anus. It has a very troublesome constipation; constipation in
connection with haemorrhoids.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">BLADDER-GENITALIA-FEMALE</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It has a paralytic
weakness of the bladder. It has retention of urine. Such a
constriction of the neck of the bladder that the urine cannot be
passed for a long time, and there is retention. In the kidneys such
a congestion as favors suppression of the urine. Bloody urine;
blood in clots. It is a remedy that favors the formation of clots
speedily. The blood that flows clots so rapidly and so densely that
it blocks up the way. Bleeding into the bladder blocks up the way.
Bleeding into the vagina causes a clot difficult to expel, and
pressing upon the urethra of the female that it is impossible for
her to pass urine. It is like an immense tampon. And hence it
reads, "urination prevented by clots," clots in the vagina, as well
as clots in the bladder. Inflammation of the ovaries; inflammation
of the uterus. It is a medicine that you will need to know when a
young, plethoric, vigorous woman comes down violently with
congestion of the uterus at the menstrual period, and she screams
because of the violent clutching and cramping of the uterus. Before
the flow starts, or just at the beginning, there is violent spasm.
The circular fibres clutch; and she describes it accurately as if a
tape were tied around that sore and congested uterus. The uterus
fills with blood clots, and the spasm to expel that blood is like a
labor-pain, and she screams again, and it is some time before the
flow becomes free enough to give relief. If this condition is met
with in rheumatic diathesis, where there is more or less rheumatism
of the joints, clutching pains and constriction in other places, we
have a remedy in Cactus.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">RESPIRATION</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The excitement and
the sharp scream can be heard by the neighbours. Suffocative
attacks with these pains, because the heart suffers, and
constriction of the heart will commonly go along with the
constriction of the uterus. In cardiac conditions, it seems as if
he will die for want of breath. Constrictions of the chest.
Oppression as if a great load was on his chest, crushing the life
out of him, so great is the constriction, and the congestion. A
sudden congestion and it comes on and ends without inflammation in
many instances. A violent rush of blood to the chest, with awful
dyspnoea and constriction of the heart- and it passes away without
inflammation. At other times Cactus has conditions like pneumonia,
inflammation of the lungs, and congestion ending in inflammation,
with the usual expectoration, bloody or blood streaked. Cactus is
also a remedy for hypostatic congestion of the lungs. He cannot lie
down, must sit up in bed, and there is a dullness of the lower part
of each lung, gradually growing higher and higher from an effusion
of serum into the lower portion of the lungs. This hypostatic
congestion is due to a cardiac weakness. Cactus will often relieve
this a few times when it occurs in old broken down cases towards
the end of Bright's disease, and at the end of dropsical conditions
and heart troubles. It will postpone death. "Could only breathe
with shoulders elevated and lying on back." Lies leaning back or
sitting quite upright. "Periodical attacks of suffocation, with
fainting; cold sweat."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">CHEST</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Feeling as if heart
was compressed or squeezed by a hand. Cardiac rheumatism. Heart
seemed to be held by an iron hand for many hours. Pain in the
cardiac region. Great pressure at heart, going round under left
axilla to back." Often this pain shoots down the left hand, is
attended with numbness, and sometimes with swelling. Numbness,
tingling, swelling. "Dull pain in the heart. Heavy pain in the
heart, aggravated from pressure. Contractive pain in the region of
the heart going down to left abdomen. At times felt as if some one
was grasping the heart firmly. Paroxysms of pain in the heart,"
that is, this kind of constriction comes in periods of violent
paroxysms. "Acute inflammation of the heart. Chronic inflammation
of the heart. Palpitation of the heart, continued day and night;
when walking, and at night when lying on the left side."</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Another thing
running through the remedy is that chest complaints often come on
or are exaggerated at 11 o'clock. Eleven o'clock in the morning, or
eleven at night. Its intermittent fever will bring on a chill with
violent congestion to the head at 11 o'clock. Regular paroxysms at
11 a.m. and 11 p.m., or sometimes at 11 a.m. and sometimes at 11
p.m. A daily chill at 11 a.m. It has cured intermittent fever of
the congestive type, when the congestions are here and there, but
particularly of head, with constrictions, congestions and
contractions.</span></p>
