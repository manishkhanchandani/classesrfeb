<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">CALADIUM
SEGUINUM</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Calad.)</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Caladium is a
wonderful remedy; perhaps some of you have read it endeavoring to
understand it; it is a difficult medicine to understand, because it
is quite evident from the provings that the prover did not
understand how to describe and report symptoms; did not know how to
tell his sensations because they were so strange; he could not
relate his mental state.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MENTAL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">An individual puts
his mind to bear upon something which seems to have taken place
during the day, but he is not quite sure whether it took place or
not; he thinks the matter over, and yet he cannot be really sure
whether it took place or not, until he actually goes and puts his
hands upon the object thought about; proves to himself by actual
contact and observation that his vague impression was so, that it
was true, then he goes away and again he is undecided as to whether
it was so or not. This relates to things that actually happened.
"Very forgetful, he cannot remember," etc. This led to the use of
Caladium for a good many different kinds of mental affections, loss
of memory where there is that vague state of mind. It might be
bordering upon imbecility, it might be the borderland of insanity.
All day long, he finds himself looking into the things that should
have been done; they have simply escaped his mind; he has forgotten
them. So the mind is worn through in places. A state of
absent-mindedness. It may come on in an acute state, with
unconsciousness. There is a good deal of congestion of the brain,
more or less excitement, but more important is prostration of the
mind, weakness of the mind; feeble-minded; inability to perform
intellectual work, it is impossible. He cannot think; the more
thought he puts upon a thing the more fatigue he has and the
further away that thing seems to be; the more he attempts it the
less concentrated is the mind upon a subject. It is not strange,
then, that the provers themselves were unable to put these ideas
into speech so as to give us an intelligent idea of proving. It is
only by reading between the lines, using the remedy and studying it
that we can straighten out this tangled skein. "Very thoughtful,
absent-minded." There is in acute states delirium, excitement of
mind, unconsciousness, stupefaction. As the febrile state is
continued, we have this mental state. This remedy is useful in
fevers that are continued.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">One of the most
important things to decide when we are going into the mental state
of a remedy is whether we shall use this remedy in hysteria, in the
delirium of the various phases of fever, or in insanity, and to
ascertain this we turn to that part of the proving which gives us
the pace of the remedy. If we want to understand the delirium of
BELLADONNA and BRYONIA to see which one would be suitable in a
certain case, we turn to the febrile action of the remedy and see
what the nature of that is; the pace tells us largely what kind of
delirium, if we do not know from the delirium itself. So we will
see that in BELLADONNA there is no continued fever, and as a remedy
must, in its very nature, be adapted to the very nature of the
disease, it would be useless to follow the many injunctions that
are written in our books telling us to give BELLADONNA in the acute
form of delirium in typhoid fever; but BRYONIA has just that
condition; hence we will see that BRYONIA is useful in such cases
which present symptoms similar to it, because the pace of the
disease is similar to the pace of BRYONIA, which has continued
fever. BELLADONNA has intermittent and remittent fever,
particularly remittent, and hence the acute delirium of BELLADONNA
is similar to the acute delirium of remittent fever. Now to bring
this point to bear; this remedy's fever is a continued fever; it
has no great amount of fever in it, but it is a continued fever; we
shall see that there is coma and stupor from fever; "delirium,
unintelligible murmuring;" mental prostration. This remedy is
suitable in low, murmuring, exhaustive cases of typhoid fever,
cases that are running a very sluggish course; not a very active
delirium; but muttering; a low form of semi-consciousness, very
often coma or stupefaction like PH-AC., a dazed mind.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Forgetfulness in
persons who are mentally and physically prostrated from sexual
excesses or from TOBACCO POISONING. It is indicated in old
debauches who are unable to perform the marital act. He has the
most tantalizing craving for the opposite sex with no ability to
perform coitus. Lascivious ideas. Such men stand on the street
corner and feast upon the forms of passing girls, and their semen
dribbles away; a state also found in PICRIC ACID and SELENIUM. You
can only cure these patients if they desire to reform, and if you
can inspire them to live a better life. Without this you cannot
save them, and those who take delight in such things are not worth
saving, and medicine will not take hold of them. To cure, the
patient must use his will to help the remedy.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Extremely nervous;
afraid of his own shadow; awake all night with lascivious thoughts,
apprehensions, especially before going to sleep; afraid of the
future. Fear of catching diseases when they are not around. This
alternates with an opposite condition. At times, he is wholly
incapable of appreciating danger. He will go into any sort of
danger without thought. Foolish boldness. We may sum up the mental
symptoms by saying he is extremely excitable.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">PHYSICAL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Vertigo on closing
the eyes. He cannot stand or walk with the eyes shut, but it is not
otherwise sufficiently related to locomotor ataxia to be of use in
that disease. Rocking, dizzy sensation after lying down and closing
the eyes, as if in a rocking chair. Vertigo and nausea in the
morning with stitch in pit of stomach. He opens his eyes and asks:
"Where am I? What do you want around me?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The text is long
with many vague symptoms. The mental symptoms are the most
important.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The whole nervous
system is in a state of excitement. He is full of fear; startled by
the slamming of a door, or the rattling of a newspaper. Cannot
sleep if there is the least noise. Things are done in great haste.
Nervous excitement.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The patient in
general is aggravated by warmth and the warm room, and ameliorated
by cool open air. Yet he wants warm drinks in the stomach. Longs
for beer without a decided thirst. Eats without hunger and drinks
without thirst. Nervous fantastic things run through the remedy
showing its relation to neurasthenic and hysterical patients.
Eructations.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There is a
sensitiveness of the skin. Crawling; creeping. He has the
spider-web sensation. Sensation of a fly crawling on the face. The
perspiration is sweetish, and if he is in a room with others, while
perspiring, the flies will all light on him. Sweetish odor to the
perspiration which attracts the flies.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Tobacco heart. The
nervous symptoms of tobacco are similar to those of Caladium, and
Caladium is useful in all sorts of nervous conditions, the effect
of tobacco and cigarette smoking. It has a number of times turned
the patient entirely away from his cigar, and removes the
overwhelming craving that prevents smokers breaking off their
habit. Headaches and mental states in smokers.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Itching is violent,
especially about the genitals. It is useful in extremely nervous
women who suffer from pruritus vulvae, keeping them awake at night,
attended with abnormal excitement.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Stools soft, yellow,
pasty, and mushy, as in typhoid. Stitches as from knives in the
rectum. There are many urinary symptoms. Urine offensive, putrid,
scanty.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Pulsating in the
stomach after walking; empty feeling, fluttering in the
stomach.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Violent sexual
desire with relaxed penis. Impotency. Erections when half asleep in
the morning, ceasing when fully awake. When the desire is most
marked, he has no ability. Automatic erections without desire,
strong and painful. During an embrace no emission. It has urethral
discharge and is useful in gonorrhoea. In vigorous persons after
the gonorrhoeal discharge has been improperly suppressed, sometimes
impotency is the result of the suppression. Caladium has cured as
frequently as THUJA. Itching eruption on the scrotum.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The most striking
symptom of the female sexual organs is the pruritus; she is
compelled to scratch, and the torment reduces her in body and
mind.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There are some
strange sleep symptoms. Kept awake by crawling. Sleeplessness from
pruritus, especially in the genitals. Groans and moans anxiously in
sleep so that he wakens the neighbours. Restless sleep; anxious,
vivid dreams which he remembers better than the things of the day.
Falls asleep and continues to dream of the same subject where he
left off.</span></p>
