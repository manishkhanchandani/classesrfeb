FLUORATA</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Calc-f.)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This chemical union
of lime and fluoric acid gives us a remedy with a new nature and
properties. However, conversant one may be with either or both of
these elements, he could not predict the curative powers held in
this double remedy. I refer to its ability to cure indurated
infiltrations of glands, cellular tissues and bony formations. A
nodule in the course of a tendon, an exostosis, a stony hard gland,
bony infiltration in the periosteum, rice bodies in cartilages have
been cured by this remedy wonderful to tell, when there was a
paucity of symptoms. It will cure of course when symptoms agree,
but it needs proving in order that individualization may be oftener
possible.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A recurrent fibroid
in the hollow of the knee was removed once by the knife, but
returned, and grew to the size of a fist. The leg was drawn up to
forty-five degrees, and the knee became immovable. This wonderful
remedy was prescribed on the symptoms of the case and the hardness
of the tumor. The tumor gradually dwindled, the limb became normal
and as good as ever; this patient has since born a healthy child-is
still perfectly free from the trouble. It is now ten years since
she was cured.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The patient is
sensitive to cold, to drafts, to changes in the weather, and to
damp weather. The symptoms are ameliorated by heat and by warm
applications. The symptoms are worse during rest.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This is a useful
remedy in gout, with copious pale urine and diarrhoea. The patient
is sad and miserable. This remedy has cured a fluctuating tumor on
the cranium of infants known as Cephalaematoma. Blur before the
eyes after exerting the vision. Cataract. It cures ulceration of
the cornea if the edges are hard; also hard, small spots and
conjunctivitis. It has cured adenoids and thick, yellowish green
discharge from the nose. Offensive catarrh of long standing. Scanty
enamel of the teeth.</span></p>

<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Pain, ulceration and
granulation of the throat, worse from cold, and better from warm
drinks. Pain worse at night. Large indurated tonsils will be cured
after BAR-C. has failed.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">ABDOMEN</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Pain in the liver at
night, worse lying on the painful side, better from motion. Cutting
pains in the liver, better walking.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Diarrhoea in gouty
subjects. Itching of anus and haemorrhoids, painful and hard
bleeding. Fissure of anus. Constipation.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">URINE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Copious watery
urine. Strong smelling urine. Urine causes smarting when
passing.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-MALE-FEMALE</span></p>

Nodular testes. Varicose veins of the vulva. Uterine fibroid. Hard
nodules in the mammae. Indurated cervical glands.</span></p>

exostosis at the angle of the eighth rib. It cured a lumbago, worse
during rest, and better from heat, after RHUS-T. had failed. Pain
in back, extending to the sacrum.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">SLEEP</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Vivid dreams and
unrefreshing sleep. Jumps out of bed in a dream.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It is similar to
SILICA in suppuration.</span></p>
