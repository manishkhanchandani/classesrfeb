that this patient scrapes mucus from the larynx before he can talk
or sing. Hoarseness, dry, hacking cough day and night. Tubercular
laryngitis.</span></p>

<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">CHEST</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Stitching pains in

a very useful remedy in phthisis and bloodspitting. Much sweat on

CAUST. Soreness of the chest to touch. Palpitation, with trembling

<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">BACK</span></p>

<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The most severe
tearing, shooting pains are in the lower limbs. The probable reason
for this is that the lower limbs are always cold to the knees, and
the cold parts are always the suffering parts in this remedy. Sharp
pains in tendons of the lower limbs. Intense aching boring pains in
the knees, and long bones. Pains in the tibia with soreness.
Drawing pain in the tibia. Cramp in the calves. Ulcers on the legs;
weak, chronic; no granulation. Rheumatism of the ankles. Caries of
the os calcis. Stinging and shooting in the toes.</span></p>
