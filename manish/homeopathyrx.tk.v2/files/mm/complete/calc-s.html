<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">CALCAREA
SULPHURICA</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8" style="tab-stops:left 96.65pt;"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Calc-s.)</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Many years ago.
Schuessler introduced this remedy, and it has been used extensively
upon the biochemic theory. Many excellent cures have been made in
this way that most of us are able to recognize as homeopathic
cures, though it is a sort of crude homeopathy. By studying these
cures, many symptoms may be obtained not supposed to be of
importance by these reporters. These symptoms often furnish a basis
for further consideration or further clinical observation. Many
fragmentary provings have also been made, furnishing many of the
symptoms recorded in this article. The author frequently made use
of Schuessler's 12th potency, later the 30th and 200th; at present
much higher potencies. From all of these many valuable symptoms
have been obtained. Some of these symptoms have come out upon the
sick while under the influence of this remedy, and have been since
confirmed; so that the following symptoms must now furnish the best
basis that, we have to prescribe on. The best consideration that
this remedy has ever received will be found in Boericke and Dewey's
Materia Medica of the Tissue Remedies.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The tendency to the
formation of abscesses in the body in any place is a strong feature
of this remedy, and is quite similar to PYROG. An abscess that has
ruptured and is slow to heal with a continuous discharge of yellow
pus is a strong indication for this remedy. The patient desires the
open air; is sensitive to drafts; takes cold easily. It is very
useful in the management of malignant growths after ulceration has
set in. It is under such circumstances an excellent palliative. It
is a deep acting constitutional remedy, an anti-psoric, and if
given early enough will prevent a malignant growth terminating in
its usual way. It is useful in the affections of bone, caries of
bone. While the patient is cold in general, he often requires to be
uncovered because of particular conditions. For instance, in croup
and in headaches he feels the heat too much, but the pains of the
body are often relieved by heat. He is sensitive to both cold and
heat. After becoming cold, complaints come on. Tendency to take
cold in drafts, or on slight occasions. He is sensitive to cold,
wet weather. It cures the underlying basis of epilepsy,
epileptiform and hysteric convulsions. The patient is aggravated
from exertion. His muscles are flabby; he is disposed to
haemorrhagia. When well selected remedies act only a short time,
and the symptoms agree, this remedy is one that should be thought
of along with SULPH., PSOR. and TUB. Complaints from straining
muscles and tendons, from overlifting, etc. Lame back from such
causes. Throughout the chest and head, and sometimes extending into
the limbs, there is a violent orgasm of blood, flushes of heat and
pulsations. Onanism and sexual excesses reduce the economy to a
state whereby they feel their constitutional disturbance, and this
is one of the remedies that elevate the body to a better state of
order in such conditions. Pain in the bones day and night.
Pulsating all over the body. Standing aggravates many complaints,
but especially the joints. Swollen and indurated glands. Twitching
of the muscles all over the body. Many of the symptoms are
aggravated on waking. Many symptoms are aggravated walking and
especially walking fast and becoming heated. Aggravation from being
overheated. Wants to uncover. Aggravation from the warmth of the
bed. A warm room aggravates. Warm wraps aggravate. Great bodily
weakness. Thick yellow discharges from the mucous membranes. Thick
bloody discharges. Purulent exudations in serous sacs. Bloody pus
from abscesses, ulcers and mucous membranes. Prolonged suppuration.
Wants to keep still.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Now, it will be
found that the above general symptoms prevail throughout the
particulars in many instances, and it will appear that the bodily
state is more or less penetrated with these symptoms.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The patient is

anger and vexation. Aversion to answering questions. He is easily

sensitive to a draft and to the air. In this patient uncovering is
grateful. The patient throws off the covers and wants the air and
seems to breathe better and croups less. It may seem strange that
