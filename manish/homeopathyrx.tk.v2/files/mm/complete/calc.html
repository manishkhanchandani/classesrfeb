<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">CALCAREA
CARBONICA</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Calc.)</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">If you were about to
produce a Calcarea subject to order you could do so by feeding him
lime or lime water until the digestive organs were so debilitated
that they could no longer digest lime, and then the tissues would
be increasingly deprived of what they need, and give us the lime
subject, the "bone salt inanition" case, for that is really what it
is. Infants that are fed lime water in the milk will in a little
while be lime subjects. They will soon get in such a state that
they cannot take the lime from their natural food, and the result
will be a Calcarea subject, such as we are about to describe. But
the natural lime cases are those that have a natural sickness, are
born so, born with an inability to digest the lime that is in their
natural food, and they grow fat and flabby, and produce deficient
bones. There is a greater proportion of cartilaginous material in
the bones than lime, and the bones bend, and take on, diseases and
destructive troubles. Deficient teeth or no teeth at all. The bones
simply stop growing, and the patient goes into marasmus. What a
foolish notion it is to feed that infant lime water because he
cannot digest lime! Is it not just as reasonable as anything else
in allopathy? and yet our homeopaths use allopathic medicines. They
use the lowest potencies they can get and it would seem strange if
those substances cured any better in the hands of the homeopath
than in the hands of the allopath. Now, it is astonishing that one
single dose of the potency suitable to meet the state of disorder
will make that infant commence to digest its food, and appropriate
from its food the lime substance that it needs in its bones, and
wherever else it needs it. All at once, the teeth begin to grow;
the bones begin to grow, and the legs get stiff enough for him to
begin to walk, and they will hold him up. It is astonishing what
changes will take place under the various medicines that are
suitable for the disturbances of the hair, and the bones and nails.
The remedy must be sufficiently potentized to correspond with the
wrong. It certainly must not be crude because the child is already
stunted by the crude material. You will see within a month or six
weeks after giving a solitary dose of the sufficiently potentized
remedy the nails that were corrugated and uneven and spotted and
irregular will form a margin and will grow out smooth. You will see
the ugly little crowns upon the teeth, distorted, and black things
as they come up out of the gums; but when they have been under the
suitable homeopathic remedy you will see them form a margin line,
and from there on the teeth look healthy, and from there on the
little body of the tooth is smooth and round; just as if that child
had had an impulse to grow better teeth. That same thing probably
takes place where the bones exist. The periosteum takes on healthy
work. This is the Calcarea state when the patient needs lime and he
cannot get it because he has been cloyed; or, because he has
indigestion, he is unable to assimilate the lime that is in his
food, and it goes through him and does not affect him. So it is
with much of the sickness we have, an inability to extract from the
food and assimilate such things, as the body needs. Would not
anyone be a simpleton to suppose that he had been the cause of the
building of a tooth? You do not build mole hills out of our high
potencies; they simply establish a state of order, so that
digestion and assimilation go on, order is established and the
tissues are improved. Health comes, beauty, a growth of hair,
better skin, better nails.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Calcarea
constitution is what we want to know. We do not need to know that
the individual has been poisoned by lime; it is not worth much to
know it, because that is not the index to the remedy. If
indigestion of lime has been brought about by lime, it may need one
of ten other remedies to overcome that indigestion for lime. It is
not always Calcarea that covers the symptoms. The medicine that
covers the symptoms is the one that will change the economy from an
abnormal to a normal state, and digestion will become orderly, and
we will have growth and prosperity in the economy. The Calcarea
case is to be known by the symptoms, and not by the fact that the
patient has been poisoned by lime; the chances are that those we
have to treat have never had any lime. Many of them have never been
poisoned by lime but have been unable to assimilate lime from
birth.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Calcarea is full of
CONGESTIONS, determination of blood to the head; cold feet; hot
head; congestion of the chest. Calcarea corresponds in a very high
degree to the chlorotic and anaemic, pale and waxy, and in spite of
this plump. It has both fat, flabby and pale patients, and it has
emaciated states, too. Muscles emaciate. Emaciated about the neck;
emaciated about the neck and from there downwards. Anaemic
conditions; pale, waxy, sickly; pale lips; pale ears; pale fingers;
pale and yellowish. Chlorosis is a word especially relating to the
anaemia of girls. A large number of remedies is indicated in those
conditions, but Calcarea produces the kind of anaemia known as
chlorosis. It produces most pernicious anaemia. Great RELAXATION in
the tissues everywhere; relaxation of muscles; relaxation of veins;
relaxation of the walls of blood-vessels to such a great extent,
especially in the lower limbs and anus, that there are marked
haemorrhoidal manifestations or marked varicose veins in the legs.
Distended veins, burning in these varicose veins. Burning and
smarting. Bleeding and oozing. Inflammation and painful swelling of
joints.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Another marked
feature running through the remedy is its tendency to attack
GLANDS, the glands of the neck, all of the glands of the body,
especially the lymphatic glands. The lymphatic glands in the
abdomen become hard, inflamed and sore, like great nodules, like
hickory, nuts; tubercular. Calcarea is useful in tubercular
formations. Calcareous degenerations, calcareous glands, induration
of glands. It is useful in INDURATIONS in ulcers, and the base of
ulcers, and round about ulcers, hence its wonderful use in
palliating and restraining the growth of malignant ulcers, as
malignant ulcers always have an indurated base. Old cancerous
ulcers are greatly restrained in their growth, that is, the
constitutional state is much improved, the patient himself has more
endurance and the ulcers will take on healing. In cancerous
affections that would kill in sixteen months the patient will live
five years with Calcarea, if Calcarea is indicated. That is
something, and many times that is all that can be expected in a
cancerous growth. In glandular affections where the glands round
about are infiltrated and hard, where there is much burning and
stinging pain, where the growth has invaded and appropriated the
surrounding tissues so that there are adhesions, matters are
serious. There is malignancy in almost all these cases. They differ
entirely from glands that are loose from the skin, glands that roll
under the skin, and have no fibrous attachment. Cancerous
affections burn and sting. Calcarea cures many tumors, fatty,
cystic, if the symptoms agree, so strongly is it related to this
building up process in glands. It builds up glands and
bone.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Another thing
running through the remedy is a PYAEMIC state, in which there are
abscesses in deep muscles. Abscesses deep in the neck, deep in the
thigh, in the abdomen. You will be astonished to learn that
Calcarea will take care of the abscess (when the symptoms agree),
and it will not break. I have many times seen an abscess disappear
when fluctuation was most positive. I have seen those abscesses
disappear when pus was shown to be present by the needle; I have
not only seen the abscesses go away, but also the pyaemic state,
which was prior to it. We have but a few medicines that will do
that. There is something singular about this. Why does Calcarea
favor the resorption of that fluid and encourage the part to become
calcareous? It is more than I am able to explain, but it does
it-when the symptoms agree. But SULPH. and SIL., when their
symptoms agree hasten suppuration. But Calcarea has that peculiar
action of concentrating and contracting. One may be indicated in
one case, the other may be indicated in the other. There are times
when SIL. is indicated and the abscess is in such a dangerous place
that if SIL. is given the result that naturally belongs to the
spreading of that abscess is dangerous; in such an instance the
surgeon must be called to drain the abscess in a safe manner, even
when we know that if that abscess were located in a safe place, it
would be far better for that patient to have the remedy he needs.
Sometimes the periosteum is injured by a hammer striking it through
muscles, injuring or contusing the periosteum. Inflammation will
set in, pus will form rapidly, and if Calcarea is indicated by the
constitution of the patient the surgeon's knife is entirely
useless, and a most detrimental thing. But in thinking from the old
standpoint, the physician who knows nothing about Homeopathy, and
the wonders of our homeopathic remedies, would hold up his hands in
horror. Why, if you produce a resorption of that pus into the
system you will have blood poisoning and death." But under Calcarea
this resorption does take place in some manner, and the patient
improves every moment, he stops his sweating, his rigor has
disappeared, he becomes perfectly comfortable, his appetite
improves, he is stronger by the time it is over, and remains well.
Judging from the old standpoint, we cannot conclude anything about
the problems that will come up under Homeopathy. We can only judge
from our standpoint, and from what we know. And if you hear that
somebody has tried this and tried that without success, remember
that somebody has only demonstrated his own failure. Homeopathy is
capable of demonstrating itself in all intelligent hands; wherever
the physician has intelligence and makes use of the law and applies
the remedy in accordance with the symptoms he will see the case
turn out as described.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Another grand
feature running through this remedy is its ability to grow POLYPI.
Those who need Calcarea will grow polypi in the nose and ears, in
the vagina, in the bladder, and here and there. Cystic growths also
and strange little papillomata.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Another strange
thing that it does is to cause EXOSTOSES. This state of disorder
comes from the irregularity in the distribution of the lime. You
would think that nature would try to distribute it around evenly
where it can do the most good. But when this bone salt inanition
has commenced the lime may be piled up in one place, and almost
absent in another. One bone will be cartilaginous and another will
have bony growths on it. Softening of the bone. Defective formation
of bone. A keynote has grown out of this, viz: "Late learning to
walk," because the legs are so weak. It is not late learning to
walk, but it is late walking. It knows how to walk, but it can't
walk. NAT-M. has brain trouble, in which the child is late LEARNING
to do things. "Tardy development of bone tissues. Curvatures."
Muscles flabby. Joint affections, like hip-joint disease. It is
full of RHEUMATISM. Rheumatic and gouty conditions of the
joints.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Calcarea patient
is a CHILLY patient. Sensitive to the cold air. Sensitive to the
raw winds. Sensitive to the coming of a storm; sensitive to the
coming of cold weather, and when the weather changes from warm to
cold it seems impossible for him to keep warm; he wants the body
kept warm. The head is sometimes congested; and it is hot to the
touch; but it often feels cold to him. His scalp feels as if it
were cold. But the body is nearly always cold to the touch and he
feels cold, and he wants plenty of clothing. The feet are cold. He
sweats in various places, sweats in spots. Sweats upon the
forehead, or upon the face, or upon the back of the neck, or the
front of the chest, or his feet. Sensitiveness to cold and WEAKNESS
run through the remedy. Weakness in the legs. Inability to endure.
Worse from every kind of exertion. Out of breath. Fat, flabby
anaemic subjects, sometimes they look plump, often flushed in the
face, but they have no endurance, and if such a patient undertakes
a little exertion, he is down sick with a fever, or a headache.
Calcarea is full of complaints brought on from lifting, from
exertion, from walking, from walking enough to get into a sweat;
and these come very suddenly, because he cannot stop that
perspiration by keeping still without getting sick. If he gets into
a sweat, and stops long enough to be comfortable, the perspiration
will stop so suddenly that he will have a chill, or he will have a
headache. Weak, tired, anxious. Difficulties of breathing. Weak
heart. Weak all over. No ability of the muscles to sustain
prolonged effort and it is the same way with the mind. No ability
of the mind to sustain prolonged mental effort. Calcarea is A TIRED
PATIENT. He is suffering from want of lime. He has been unable to
digest lime, and he goes into a state with enlarged glands,
emaciation of the neck and of the limbs, while the fat and the
glands of the belly increase. Especially is this noticed in
children. A big-bellied child, with emaciated limbs and emaciated
neck. Enlarged glands. Pale, and flabby, and sickly. Those that
take on flesh without any increase of strength. They take on flesh
and grow flabby. Remain feeble. Those that get up from sickness
take on flabby flesh, and in a little while, they become dropsical.
The Calcarea patient can't go upstairs; he is so tired in his legs,
and so tired in the chest; he pants and suffocates from going
upstairs. He has every evidence of muscular weakness and
flabbiness. Nutrition is impaired everywhere. This is the kind of
patient that used to be called scrofulous; now we call the
condition psora; and Calcarea is one of our deepest anti-psorics.
It is a medicine that goes deep into the life, and takes a deep
hold of every part of the economy.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Now we will take up
the MENTAL SYMPTOMS. All the mind symptoms represent Calcarea as in
a state of great WEAKNESS; in ability to prolong mental operation.
Becomes very tired from mental work. Full of anxiety. He is tired
mentally and tired physically, from mental work and breaks down in
a sweat, and becomes excited, irritable, and disturbed. Great
disturbance of the emotions; complaints lasting for days and weeks
from excitement of the emotions; from worrying, from vexation, or a
general emotional disturbance is prostrated. "Inability to apply
himself." Inability to do good thinking for some time after such
excitement, disturbance or worry. It is very useful in complaints
from prolonged worry, from prolonged application to business, from
excitement. It is full of a peculiar kind of mental feeling,
differing quite considerably from most remedies; he feels his
exhaustion of mind, and it seems to him that this weakness, and
this inability to do and to think connectedly, must be going
towards insanity, he broods over it, he is convinced that he is
insane, or about to become insane, that he is getting weak-minded,
and he looks it, too, because what he has in his mind is this: that
he is becoming insane or weak-minded, and he thinks people will
observe it. He thinks people look at him suspiciously, and he looks
at them suspiciously, and he wonders why they do not say something
to him about it. He thinks that he is going insane, and that other
people are observing his state of mind, and he keeps that in his
mind most of the time. He thinks of it day-times, and he gets
greatly roused up over it; he thinks of it nights and it keeps him
awake. He lies awake late at night thinking. Calcarea leads to
little ideas, that is, it compels the mind to littleness, to little
ideas, or to dwell on little things, but his mind, as it were, is
forced to dwell upon things that he cannot put aside. When the
Calcarea patient begins to relate to his friends how he feels they
all naturally say to him, "Why don't you put that aside; that
doesn't amount to anything," but to him it is a big thing, and he
cannot put it aside; all these little things combine to convince
him that he is going crazy. He cannot calculate, he cannot do deep
thinking, he cannot dwell upon deep things; he may have been a
philosopher, and he has lost his ability to think out things in
philosophy. He has lost his mental depth. He forms conclusions out
of his emotions rather than from his intelligence. He forms
conclusions about things, as he wants them to be. You would almost
think he wants to grow crazy; he keeps talking about it so much. He
is unable to accept any sort of argument, and this grows worse and
worse. He is unable to accept the assurance of his physician, in
whom he has always had confidence. It is no use, it seems, to try
to reason with him; yet he is not so far gone but he can reason
about other things except his own mental state. He imagines things;
and the things he imagines you will really wonder at his dwelling
upon them so, because they are such little things. And so it is
when he goes into insanity, imbecility, or a general breakdown. It
is a passive state, in which he sits and thinks about his little
affairs, and his little things that amount to nothing at all, and
he sits and sits- the text says, "Sits and breaks sticks, or bends
pins all day long, with his fingers." Does little things, and in
this way he keeps himself busy, wears himself out more and more.
Any amount of thinking becomes impossible. It is almost impossible
for him to come to a conclusion, for he never figures it twice
alike. He cannot add and subtract even in the simplest forms. Now,
he thinks about this matter so much and thinks everybody else is
watching him, until finally the instant, he closes his eyes he has
visions. Just as soon as he gets down quiet and thinks "Now I will
go to sleep, I will get rid of all this," and he closes his eyes to
sleep, then he must get them open as quick as possible, he is in a
state of excitement, for he sees horrid little spooks; he cannot
keep his mind clear. He cannot go to sleep because his thoughts
trouble him, and he sees all sorts of things. There is no congruity
in his mind. We know that strong intelligence puts aside such
follies, but these are just the things that Calcarea patients dwell
upon. Talking to himself. He lies in bed, or sits, when he is
alone, and carries on a general conversation with every conceivable
individual he has had to do with, on every conceivable subject; and
it multiplies and it grows, and he imagines it is all real. We see
how far that is removed from the healthy mind, and yet he is not
fit for the insane asylum, with all of these strange things, for
when he is roused he does carry on a conversation, and he does as
ordinary people do. When he is alone, when he has nobody to talk
with him, he does these strange things. He is controlled and
dominated when he is in company, to a great extent, and hence these
things are not brought out. He carries out that same idea when he
becomes delirious or insane. Picks his fingers, and does all sorts
of peculiar little things. Sees visions and faces of persons when
eyes are closed. "Imagines someone is walking beside her." In the
proving of SIL. that was observed very strongly. It has been
observed in PETROLEUM, and in Calcarea. In a perfect state of
health, with a strong, vigorous intelligence, it is not likely to
be felt, but in nervous people, and especially in women, it is
common. "Mental aberration with horrid visions. Sees dogs crowding
around him, fights them off." Here is a sensation, occurring in
nervous women, "Feels as if she would like to run up and down, and
scream." Feels as if she could not help it, she must scream. That
occurs in persons overwrought, dreadfully excited from a loss in
the household by death. The mother loses her child, or husband; or
a young girl loses her intended. She is broken-hearted, and greatly
excited. It is a hysterical state. And yet I have seen the same in
men. I remember one. It came upon him from business cares. He had
that same feeling; he would walk up and down the house, he said he
felt as if he must fly or jump out of a window, or do something.
That is analogous to the mental state found in hysteria, or a great
state of nervous excitement. "She thinks and talks of nothing but
murder, fire, rats, etc." That is that same idea of talking about
little things and foolish things. Things that are not interesting
to anybody. And yet I have seen these things in patients and I
would ask them why they did it. It is generally said, "I tried a
good while to stop it, and when I could not I just kept right on at
it, for it seemed to do me good." "She thinks and talks of murder,
fire, rats, etc." Your patient may talk about other foolish things,
but it is only to illustrate the idea that she sits and talks about
foolish things, and cannot control herself; thinking, thinking, or
expressing it, talking, talking, talking. Violent screaming spells.
And then the Calcarea patient will refuse to talk will say nothing.
She may talk to herself when alone, but will decline to enter into
conversation, and will sit perfectly silent. A Calcarea patient
sometimes takes an aversion to work, and quits work. He will quit a
most thriving business, and go home and do nothing, after being
fatigued in carrying on the business until it reaches a most
thriving condition. He says business is not good for him. He is
tired of business, and when he goes to his business, again it seems
as if it would drive him crazy. He does not want to see it, he does
not want to know anything about it. Of course, you can readily see
that it is not so much in the Calcarea patient that he is driven to
weakness and fatigue from distress in business, although it has
that, but that which I am speaking about is that he has overworked
until he has given out, and right in the midst of his success he
quits his business and goes home, and leaves all- it looks just as
if he were lazy. If you look at him, you come to the conclusion
that he is lazy. Yet it is an insanity; not the laziness that
belongs to tramp nature, though that also might be cured many
times. He has been industrious, and all at once takes a turn. A
great change occurs in the mind, and he takes on symptoms. It is
not such persons as were born that way, born lazy, never would
work; but those that become lazy. It is like the symptom in a pious
upright man, whose walk and conversation has been upright, but all
at once, he turns and commences to swear. Of course, we know that
individual is insane. On the other hand, we have patients that have
been only ordinarily industrious that develop an insanity for work,
and it seems they have ability in that insane industry to work
almost night and day; they are up early and late. It is a sick
state. So when we see in the Repertory "Industry" it does not mean
an ordinarily industrious state but one that is exaggerated into a
symptom. He has become so industrious that he has a mania for
work.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Whimpering.
Low-spirited and melancholy." It is a strange thing to see a bright
little girl of 8 or 9 years old taking on sadness, melancholy, and
commencing to talk about the future world, and the angels, and that
she wants to die and go there, and she is sad, and wants to read
the Bible all day. That is a strange thing; and yet Calcarea has
cured that. ARS. has cured that state, and also LACHESIS. They are
a little inclined to be precocious, and they have attended the
Sunday-school, and they have taken too seriously the things they
have learned. Children sad and unhappy, and old people, who take on
a loathing of life, become weary of life. That is a good deal like
AURUM. In going over AURUM I explained that, and dwelt upon it,
that the highest love is the love of life; and when an individual
ceases to love his own life, and is weary of it, and loathes it,
and wants to die, he is on the border line of insanity. In fact,
that is an insanity of the will. You have only to look with an
observing eye to see that one may be insane in the affections, or
insane in the intelligence. One may remain quite intact, and the
other one be destroyed. We find in Calcarea both equally disturbed.
One patient may be insane in his voluntary system, so that all of
his loves are perverted; he has no affection that is like what it
used to be, like it was when he was well. Antipathy to his family
or some member of his family. Or, he may have the affection fairly
intact, but no intelligence, and does all sorts of strange
things.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">He is full of fear.
Weary of life; hopelessness, anxiety. The world is black. "Fear
that something sad or terrible will happen. Fears that she will
lose her reason, or that people will observe her confusion of
mind." "Fear of death; of consumption; of misfortune; of being
alone." Fear abounds, especially when the voluntary system is
disturbed. She is startled at every noise. He can't sleep so that
the body rests or the mind rests. He is disturbed in his sleep with
horrible dreams. His sleep is a restless one. "Great anxiety and
oppression. Restlessness and palpitation. Despairing; hopeless."
These symptoms have to be coupled and connected with that
leucophlegmatic, pale, flabby, sickly individual. "Child cross and
fretful. Easily frightened." Many complaints after exertion of the
mind. Many complaints after excitement, chagrin or
fright.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">VERTIGO</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">He is so weak in his
circulation, so much disturbed in the heart, it palpitates from
every excitement. He is out of breath from every physical exertion;
and these take part so much in the circulation of blood in the
body, have so much to do with circulation of blood in the brain,
have so much to do with the intellect, with the sensorium, that we
see at once vertigo on almost all occasions, intermingled with all
sorts of symptoms. Fear, anxiety, and vertigo. If his emotions stir
him up, he becomes dizzy. From going upstairs, the blood mounts to
the head, and he becomes dizzy. Confusion of mind and vertigo from
mental exertion. If he becomes shocked, or has bad news, or has any
mental excitement or chagrin, this vertigo will come out. Confusion
of mind, determination of blood to the head, cold extremities,
covered with sweat, with vertigo. "Vertigo, when climbing into high
places;" that is the effort of going up. The blood rushes to the
head and he becomes dizzy. "On going upstairs or up a hill. On
suddenly rising, or turning the head, even when at
rest."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">One of the most
striking symptoms of THE HEAD of the Calcarea patient is the sweat;
the sweat of the head upon the slightest exertion. He will sweat on
the face when he sweats nowhere else, and his head is covered with
cold sweat when he is comfortable in other places about the body.
The same thing is true about the feet. When his feet become very
cold, they will sweat. When they are warm, they will sweat. You
would naturally think that a person going into a cold room would
stop his sweating, but sometimes, the Calcarea patient will break
out in a sweat, upon the head, and upon the feet, in a cold room.
He sweats upon the forehead, so that every draft of air makes him
chilly, and this brings on headache. Coldness of the whole scalp,
so he has to wrap up the head. Yet during congestions, the head is
hot. So it has at times great heat in the head. The Calcarea
headaches are stupefying, they are benumbing; they bring on
confusion of mind. The Calcarea patient has a catarrh in the nose,
with more 01 less discharge; at his best, he has considerable
discharge. But he goes into a cold place, the discharge is slacked
up, and he gets a headache. Headache over the eyes. Congestion of
the head; back of the head. "Tearing headache above the eyes down
to nose," is a strong symptom of Calcarea. It seems sometimes as if
a great wedge were in there. This is relieved by very hot
applications. It is relieved in the dark; it is aggravated in the
daylight. He must go into a dark room and lie down for relief.
Sometimes this headache is ameliorated by lying down in the dark.
This headache continues to grow worse during the day, until in the
evening, it becomes so severe that it is attended with nausea and
vomiting. It is one of the forms of constitutional headache, it is
a headache that sometimes occurs once in two weeks. Headache every
seven days, or headache once in two weeks. Periodical headaches.
Sick-headache, the old-fashioned American sick-headache. There is
commonly a periodicity belonging to it, of seven to fourteen days,
but again, it comes on whenever he is exposed, by riding in the
wind, for he is a very chilly patient; if he becomes really chilled
or very cold, he gets a headache, a sick-headache. Then, again, it
has pain in the left side of the head. One-sided headache. Headache
worse from noise, from talking, but ameliorated in the evening,
from lying in the dark. It has headache in the temples, and this
headache seems to draw through to the root of the nose. The
headaches from the supraorbital region draw through to the nose.
Headaches in the temples seem to produce a feeling of tightness, a
feeling of great tension in the forehead. Headaches worse from
motion, from walking, from talking. Most of the Calcarea headaches,
as soon as they become severe, are attended with pulsation. The
pulsation is so strong that the patient is not satisfied by merely
saying it is a pulsation, he describes it as hammering. Most of the
pains are pressive, or tearing. "Concussive headaches." Stitching,
pulsating pains in the head, as if it would split. Headaches worse
from walking, and from a jar. Sometimes he feels a coldness in the
head, it seems as if the cold head is numb, cold as if made of
wood. He sometimes feels this numbness, and describes it as if he
had a cap, sometimes as if there were a helmet, on the head. Now,
all of these sensations are difficult to describe, but sometimes
they are one and the same thing. All the headaches of Calcarea are
more or less congestive. It is a peculiar feature of Calcarea that
the more marked the congestion of internal parts, the colder the
surface becomes. With chest troubles, and stomach troubles, and
bowel troubles, the feet and hands become like ice, and covered
with sweat; and he lies in bed sometimes with a fever in the rest
of his body, and the scalp covered with cold sweat. That is
strange. You cannot account for that by any process of reasoning in
pathology, and when a thing is so strange that it cannot be
accounted for, it becomes very valuable as descriptive of the
remedy, and is one that cannot generally be left out when
prescribing for a patient. That is almost a general state, it is so
marked. It has burning in the vertex, and this is often present
with coldness of the forehead, or the whole head may feel cold,
except a burning spot on the vertex. Calcarea will again have cold
head and icy cold feet when walking in cold air, or in very cold
weather; but as soon as the feet get warm, they go to the other
extreme, and burn so that he puts them out of bed. This has often
led inexperienced prescribers to prescribe SULPH., because that is
a keynote of SULPH. All keynote prescribers GIVE SULPH. whenever
the patient puts the feet out of bed, but a number of remedies have
burning feet, hot feet, so we are not limited to SULPH. Calcarea
has affections of the bones of the skull, the outer part of the
head. Slow formation of bone. The fontanelles remain open a long
time. It has hydrocephalic conditions, effusion in the membranes,
and the bones do not grow and keep pace with the growth of the
head, and hence the sutures commence to separate and the head grows
wider and larger all the time with hydrocephalus. In hydrocephalic
children, this sweating head is a common feature. The child lies at
night upon the pillow, and the sweat pours from the head and wets
the pillow all around; especially sweating at night. In persons
suffering from softening of the brain, the pillow is wet all around
the head. Children going through difficult dentition have dreadful
times in their dreams, they screech out in the night, and the
pillow is wet all around their head. Old plethoric patients, broken
down constitutions, fat, flabby, lymphatic patients, with enlarged
glands, with sweating of the head, cold sweating of the head. The
hair falls out, not in the regular way such as occurs in old age,
but in patches here and there. You see a bald spot on the side of
the head, or the back of the head; a tuft of hair has come out, or
in two or three places. Then it has eruptions upon the head and
face; eczema that we find in children and infants. "Thick scabs on
the head, with yellow pus." Offensive eruptions.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE-VISION</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The EYE comes in for
a share of troubles, and Calcarea is one of the best friends the
oculist has, if he knows how to use it. It is not especially
suitable for every inflammation, but in those fat, flabby
constitutions, where every cold settles in the eyes, and produces
an inflammation, and this goes on for a few days, and ulceration
begins, then study Calcarea. Vesicles are formed, break, and spread
into an ulcer. From exposure of the feet in water, from riding in
the wind, from cold, damp weather he gets eye troubles. Ulceration
of the cornea. In all of the complaints of the eyes and of the head
the photophobia is so marked that the Calcarea subject when he is
at all disturbed cannot even stand ordinary light, and to be out in
the sunlight is extremely painful, and many times inflammations are
started from merely going into a bright sunlight, from steady
looking, and from straining the eyes. All kinds of exertions bring
on headaches and eye troubles. Tension, because one muscle is weak.
There is a disturbance of accommodation. Worse from every exertion
of the eyes; you see that is like its generals, that is, aggravated
from exertion. He cannot endure any prolonged exertion; you see
that is just as true of his parts as of the whole. You know that
reading, writing and looking at one thing all are marked exertions.
With Calcarea, the part itself is worse from exertion, and the
whole body is worse from exertion. Calcarea has cured cataract.
Calcarea has other disturbances of the eyes, in connection with
head troubles, in connection with fevers, and when he is out of
sorts from great exertion; he so easily gets into a fidgety state,
confusion of mind that is almost a delirium, and on closing the
eyes, he sees the most horrible visions, spectres, ghosts. Long
before any disturbance can be observed in the tissues, or in the
retina, or any disturbance of the eye by looking into it with the
ophthalmoscope he will complain of seeing smoke, or steam in the
air before his field of vision, as if looking through a veil, as if
looking through a cloud, all meaning the same thing. "Dim vision."
His vision is weak. The muscles are weak. He suffers from dim
vision, which is going on gradually to blindness, as he grows
increasingly weak. All of his eye symptoms, and his headaches, and
his nervous symptoms are aggravated from reading, from writing,
from looking steadily at one thing. He is very much exhausted after
such an exertion and will have tearing pains over the eyes, behind
the eyes in the head. That is a peculiar kind of a headache, such
as he is in the habit of having. It may be in any part of the head.
Called eye-strain. It is a wonderful remedy for eye-strain
(ONOSMODIUM). Calcarea has cured many cases of opacity of the
cornea (BAR-I.) In an old case a cure can never be promised. It is
one of the results of disease, and we never know when we are going
to remove the results of disease, because the intelligent homeopath
never prescribes for the results of disease. He prescribes for the
patient. An opacity itself, when it is present, is not a symptom,
but a result of disease. Often when a patient is prescribed for on
his general symptoms, such a state of opacity of the cornea will,
after a while, begin to pass away. The patient grows better, feels
better himself. His symptoms commence to subside, and after the
symptoms have subsided, pathological conditions will commence to
subside. Do not be discouraged in prescribing if the pathological
conditions do not go away; but if all the symptoms of the patient
have gone away, and the patient is eating well, and is sleeping
well, and doing well, do not feel that it is impossible for that
opacity of the cornea to go away, for sometimes it will. I have
known patients to come back, years later, even after I had given
them up as cured, as their symptoms had all disappeared, and I was
foolish enough to say to the patient, "Well, I do not suppose this
condition will ever go away, but you are all well, there is nothing
to prescribe on, there is not much use of your taking any more
medicine," but in six months from that time the patient would come
back to me and say "Doctor, do you suppose the treatment you gave
me had anything to do with this trouble going away? It has nearly
all disappeared." I only tell you this to give you an idea how long
it takes to restore order, for nature herself to replace the bad
tissue and put healthy tissue in that same place, to restore an
organ. It takes time, and it is best that we should not be
surprised. It may be that the medicine has done all it can do. Here
is another thing I have seen: even when there were no symptoms
left, and after waiting a considerable time and there were no
symptoms, I have seen another dose of the same medicine that was
given on the last symptoms give the patient a great lift, and
pathological conditions commence to go away. So Calcarea is a great
friend to the oculist, and every physician ought to be just as good
a prescriber as the oculist can be, for he prescribes for the
patient. So must the oculist. In prescribing, I am in doubt whether
there can be any such thing as a specialty, because the homeopathic
physician prescribes for the patient. He prescribes for the
patient, whether he has eye disease, or ear disease, or throat
disease, or lung disease, or liver disease, etc.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the ear, we have
a great deal of trouble. It produces thick yellow discharge from
the ears. Cold, chilly weather brings on ear trouble; quite likely,
from becoming cold or chilled, from an exposure, or from a sudden
change of cold damp weather he has additional complaints in the
ears. While he is at his best the idea holds good here as in other
catarrhal conditions, there is copious discharge. But from exposure
and cold this slacks up a little, and when it does there is a
little inflammation, and like enough throbbing, and headache. That
occurs every time from exposure. Whether the catarrh is in the
nose, the eyes, or the ears, there will be headache. The Calcarea
patient is so easily disturbed from cold weather and exposure, he
is so sensitive to the cold, that it is next to impossible for him
to dress and protect himself. He is flabby and soft, easily
disturbed, sensitive to his surroundings. If it is an ear trouble,
he may have difficult hearing, abscess of the middle ear, catarrh
of the Eustachian tubes, etc., but all of these bring on headaches;
and around about the ear the glands are all affected.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The catarrh of the
NOSE is extremely troublesome. Old lingering stubborn catarrhs,
with thick yellow discharge; great crusts from the nose. In the
morning, he blows out enormous blackish, bloody chunks. He breathes
part of the night through the nose, and then his nose clogs up so
that he breathes through the mouth. It has cured a great many times
polypi of the nose. The homeopathic physician, trusting so much to
his symptoms, knows so well the remedy after studying the case that
he very likely will prescribe for the patient on the symptoms
alone. He says: This patient needs Calcarea, there is no doubt
about it. He prescribes for him and sends him away. After three or
four weeks the patient comes back with a gelatinous looking tough
thing oil a handkerchief, and says: "Doctor, look there at what
came out of my nose. Do you suppose your medicine had anything to
do with that?" Perhaps you did not know he had polypus, it does not
make any difference, your prescription cannot be any different if
he has polypi in the nose, and you do not know it is there; you
cannot by any process of torsion remove it before you prescribe, so
you will have to leave that torsion to those that do not know about
Homeopathy; and hence the examination is not so important as it is
to those who prescribe for the polypi, and forget about the
patient. Affections of the bones of the nose. That is, the catarrhs
go on so long, and they are so deep-seated, that the bones of the
nose and the cartilage of the nose are infiltrated, and they break
down. Then operators cut out bones, remove cartilage, and perform
operations too numerous to mention; and every one must have the
same operation; but in order for him to be cured, he must even
after that go to a homeopathic physician. He should first be cured
and then if there is anything to be removed let him be operated
on.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">FACE</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The FACE is sickly,
cold, covered with sweat. Sweats on the slightest exertion, and
sometimes it sweats in the night, on the forehead. "Cold sweat on
the face. Face pale and cachetic," such as we see in advanced cases
of cancer, and consumption. Face sallow, pale, sickly, dropsical.
Eruptions on the face. Eruptions about the lips; and the lips are
chapped and the mouth is raw. The lips are cracked and bleeding.
Painful swelling on the parotid glands; painful swelling of the
sub-lingual and sub-maxillary glands. The glands all take part in
the Calcarea troubles.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Calcarea is a
medicine for CHRONIC SORE THROATS. The throat appearance itself is
not always sufficient to prescribe on, but the complaints in the
throat are those that come on in persons taking cold so frequently
that the patient has not time to get over one before he goes into
another, and this engrafts upon him a chronic sore throat. It may
in the beginning be a BELL. throat, which is quite likely, but
before he gets over it, he has taken another cold. Remember that
this is a part of the Calcarea patient, that he takes cold so
easily; he takes cold from EVERY draft, from every exposure, and
from damp weather. When getting over a BELL. sore throat-about the
time he thinks he is over it he takes a new cold. Perhaps it has
been relieved two or three times with BELL., and then it settles
down into a chronic state, and there are little red patches,
perhaps little ulcers, in the throat; this extends all over. It
extends to the roof of the mouth, with a sore tongue, and a
constant dry, choking feeling in the pharynx, covering the tonsils
and extending up into the posterior nares, filling with thick,
yellow mucus. Chronic inflammation. The uvula may be puffed;
swollen. "Parts swollen, red, tumid," but in patches. The throat
very painful on swallowing; dry, choking feeling.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOMACH</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The STOMACH in
Calcarea is slow in its action. "Food taken into the stomach
remains." It does not digest. It turns sour. "Sour vomiting." Milk
sours. Milk disagrees; the digestion is also slow, feeble. He has a
feeling of tumefaction and fullness; enlargement after eating; and
everything sours in the stomach; everything disorders the stomach.
Weak digestion. The Calcarea patient has a very strong LONGING FOR
EGGS. Little children crave eggs; at every meal, they will eat
eggs, and eggs will digest better than anything else. It is very
seldom that little children naturally long for eggs; children with
cold feet, emaciated extremities, large heads, enlarged abdomen;
stomach distended like an inverted saucer, rounded out; bloated
abdomen, and slender extremities; cold and sensitive to cold; pale
skin; pale, waxy surface. Then, there is complete loss of appetite;
no desire for any kind of food. If any desire at all, IT IS FOR
EGGS. Aversion to meat; aversion to warm food. This with enlarged
glands, with goitre. Flatulency. Sour vomiting; sour diarrhoea;
that is, it has a pungent, sour odor, especially in
children.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">ABDOMEN-STOOL</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In infants living on
milk, the milk passes in an undigested form; the stool is so sour
that it is pungent. It excoriates the parts, and keeps the nates
raw in infants where the diaper comes in contact with the parts.
There are times when the abdomen is emaciated; the gases go out and
the abdomen sometimes becomes flabby; but most of the time it is
distended with flatulence. When it is flabby, it can be observed
that there are nodules in the abdomen. The lymphatic glands are
hard, and sometimes can be felt through the emaciated abdomen.
There is a TUBERCULAR tendency, and tabes mesenterica is one of the
natural endings of the lime constitution, with this, we get the
glandular affections of the bowels. Tubercular deposits in the
mesenteric glands. Diarrhoea comes on, sour, watery diarrhoea;
gradual emaciation, especially of the extremities. Every cold
brings on more indigestion, and more sour vomiting. Diarrhoea that
can't be stopped, because every time he gets a cold it renews the
diarrhoea. When it is an acute attack DULC. often relieves it, but
when it has recurred several times DULC. can no longer relieve it
and Calcarea then becomes one of the remedies.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Again, it is one of
the most useful medicines in old, lingering, stubborn cases of
CONSTIPATION. When there is, only a moderate diarrhoea the stool is
white; and when this constipation is present, the stool is white,
or like chalk. In infants taking milk you can account for the white
or pale stool, because of the milk; but when the patient does not
live on milk, and lives on ordinary substances, the stool becomes
bileless and is very light colored; is yellow or white; and in the
constipation, often the stool is very light colored and
hard.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Calcarea has a kind
of indigestion, a fermentation that favors the formation of worms,
so that Calcarea babies are sometimes wormy. Pass worms in the
stool, and vomit worms. Calcarea so corrects this indigestion, when
the symptoms agree, that worms no longer hatch out. The symptoms
disappear, and we really wonder what becomes of the worms. The idea
with the homeopathic physician is not to give vermifuges, but to
correct the digestion that worms will not thrive; and it is true
that worms will not thrive in the healthy stomach and intestines.
Whether they leave by expulsion or whether they are destroyed, or
what becomes of them, I do not know. To remove them by physicking
them out, and by vermifuges, only makes a bad matter worse, because
it increases the indigestion, it increases the turmoil. So it is
with all worms in the stomach and rectum; all those worms will come
if they are favored with just exactly the right kind of fluids to
hatch out in. They come, and they grow. I suppose at least
twenty-five times in the last twenty years have I known Calcarea to
bring away tape worm, and in most instances, I did not know it was
present; but I simply prescribed for the patient. I was not aware
of its existence. It is so with many remedies, but this more than
others.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-MALE-FEMALE</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Calearea patient
is weak sexually, with general relaxation and weakness. Sometimes
an inordinate craving, sometimes an overwhelming desire keeps him
awake at nights. But weak; weak in this way that any indulgence is
followed by weak back, sweating, weakness in general, so that he is
compelled to abstain because of the sufferings.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The woman is
affected in a similar way. You need not be surprised, when you hear
all of the constitutional weaknesses, that it is a common thing for
Calcarea women to be sterile. So tired, so relaxed; wholly unfit
for reproduction. And the same as in the male, she suffers from
lassitude, sweating, wakefulness, and weakness in general after
every coition. The parts feel relaxed. The uterus drags down.
Sensation as if parts would be forced out. State of general
weakness and general relaxation of the sexual organs of both male
and female. Calcarea has a tendency to grow warts and polypoid
growths, pedunculated growths that bleed easily, that are soft and
spongy.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The woman flows too
much at the menstrual period; too long, and, of course, this
naturally brings her around too soon. Often every three weeks,
lasting a week, with a copious flow. Menstrual period TOO SOON,
LASTING TOO LONG, AND PROFUSE. Calcarea is not always indicated;
not unless all of the symptoms go together to make up the Calcarea
patient. Sometimes it may occur to your mind to say, that with five
or six key-notes, certainly, you would give Calcarea; but suppose
you did have five or six key-notes of Calcarea, and the patient
should be a PULS. patient, would you expect to cure her with
Calcarea? Suppose the patient always avoided warm things and much
clothing, and wanted the cold open air, and still had a dozen
key-notes, you would find every time that Calcarea would fail.
Unless you combine the particulars with the things that are
general, and the generals with the particulars, unless the remedy
fits the patient from within out, generally and particularly, a
cure need not be expected. That is why I say, do not prescribe on
key-notes, but upon the symptoms of the patient.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This great state of
relaxation which we always have in every Calcarea patient is also
manifested in LEUCORRHOEA. Copious, thick, constant leucorrhoea,
discharging day and night. Leucorrhoea that is acrid, keeping up an
itching, smarting, and burning. "Leucorrhoea thick and yellow,"
from one menstrual period to another, and sometimes it intermingles
with the menstrual flow. "Vaginal polypi. Burning soreness in the
genitals" from leucorrhoea. "Itching and rawness" from leucorrhoea.
Haemorrhagia of the uterus from over-lifting; from excitement; from
shocks; from anything that greatly disturbs; from fear, from any
great emotion, or from straining the muscles. Such are the
conditions of relaxation and weakness. Inability to strain the
muscles, or to exert himself mentally or physically.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The complaints of
PREGNANCY are generally those of great relaxation and weakness.
Threatened abortion. After delivery, weakness and prostration;
sweating. Weakness from nursing.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">LARYNX AND
TRACHEA-RESPIRATION</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Calcarea voice
is that of PAINLESS HOARSENESS. The vocal cords are tired, and
cannot endure strain; almost a paralytic weakness. Sometimes a
copious flow of mucus from the larynx. Much irritation in the
larynx, but weakness. Not that burning and rawness that we find in
BELL. and PHOS., but painless hoarseness. In PHOS. it is painful,
in BELL. it is very painful. He cannot speak without pain. But in
Calcarea, he wonders why he has so much trouble in the larynx,
because he has no feeling in it. This goes on from bad to worse,
and with the tubercular tendency, look out for tubercular
laryngitis. Given early, it may keep off such a tubercular
tendency. It has cured tubercular laryngitis. Much rattling of
mucus; rattling breathing; coarse rattling; that is, much mucus in
the trachea, in the larynx, in the bronchial tubes, in the chest.
Great dyspnoea. The dyspnoea comes on FROM GOING UP STAIRS, from
walking against the wind. Anything that has any exertion in it will
bring on the dyspnoea. We find this in asthma, weak heart, weak
chest and in threatening phthisis. That state of the lungs you will
know very often by the kind of breathing; because all that are
going into phthisis are tired and weak. He is too tired to make any
effort at breathing, and he tires very easily, so that he has
difficulty in going up stairs, climbing a hill, walking against the
wind.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">CHEST-COUGH-EXPECTORATION</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The CHEST trouble
furnishes one of our best fields for Calcarea. We have spitting of
blood; prolonged cough; copious expectoration of thick yellow
mucus, or even pus; ulceration, or abscess. Tickling cough. We
have, in threatening chest trouble, the beginning emaciation, the
pallor, the sensitiveness to cold, changes, and to the cold air,
and to wet weather and to winds. He takes colds, and they all
settle in the chest; gradual emaciation in the limbs; always so
tired. It corresponds to just such constitutional weakness as
precedes, or is present in the first stages of phthisis. It stops
the patient taking cold, which is the very beginning of it. The
patient will begin to feel better after taking Calcarea, and it
improves his general state, and it will even encyst tubercular
deposits. It turns them from a caseous into a calcareous form, and
cysts have been found in the chest long afterwards. Patients have
lived a long time and improved, and gone into a general state of
health, when quite well advanced with tubercular deposits. Of
course, when any person is well into a tubercular condition, it may
be expected that he will go. Do not believe or think favorably of
cures for consumption. Every little while we have someone coming
out with something or other that cures consumption, a new cure.
Everyone who knows much about the real nature of phthisical
conditions, cannot have much confidence in such things, and I
certainly lose respect for an individual who has a consumption
cure. He must either be crazy or something worse. Generally, he is
after the money that may be in it. Hardly anyone who knows anything
about it can conscientiously present a consumption cure to the
world. To prevent those things is what we want to do, and this is
the great sphere of Calcarea. The expectoration is sweetish very
often, like PHOS. and STANNUM. White, yellow, thick. We might go
over all the general symptoms here, the soreness, the tenderness,
the kind of pains, the lassitude, and a great many symptoms of that
sort, they are too numerous to mention, but they are not
descriptive, for the reason that after you get these pains and
study them carefully, you are no better off. You must study the
CONSTITUTION of Calcarea, the nature of Calcarea, its
character.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There are spine
symptoms; plenty of them. Weak; all degrees of weakness. The
Calcarea patient is so weak in the back that he slides down in the
chair while sitting; cannot sit upright in his chair. Rests on the
back of his head. The back of his chair and the back of his head
come in contact. A weak spine, a sensitive spine, and the glands of
the neck are swollen. Again, a marked condition of the spine is
where the lime element is deficient, and we soon get deformity;
curvature. It may be surprising to you to hear that Calcarea is a
great help, and has sometimes cured that without any brace or
support whatever, when taken early. You take infants manifesting a
weakness of the spine, let them lie flat on their back in bed, put
them on the indicated remedy-it is sometimes Calcarea-and in a
little while that knuckling will cease, and the little one will sit
up straight. Such wonderful things occur under the use of Calcarea,
when the symptoms agree.</span></p>

we have all the RHEUMATIC conditions that it is possible to
describe. Gouty affections of the joints, with enlarged joints;
gouty conditions, especially of the small joints, of the toe and
finger. Rheumatic complaints of the joints from every exposure,
from every change of the weather to cold, especially if it is cold
and damp. The feet are always cold, or cold and damp, except at
night in bed after piling clothing upon the feet more than any
other part of the body, then the feet begin to get warm, and then
they often go to the other extreme and burn; and so they burn at
night in bed. But the feet are so cold that the patient has to put
more clothing on the feet than the body will endure. Cold, damp
feet. Late walking. Clumsiness; awkwardness; stiffness. Rheumatic
conditions. Stiffness belongs to Calcarea all over. Stiff on
beginning to move; stiff at night on rising from a seat. Stiffness
in all joints on beginning to move; and if it turns cold or there
is a cold rain, the Calcarea patient always suffers; suffers from
coldness, stiffness, rheumatism; has rheumatism in every cold
change in the weather.</span></p>

Grinding the teeth. A child in sleep, chews, swallows, and grinds
