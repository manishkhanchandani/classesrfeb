<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">CAMPHORA
OFFICINARUM</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Camph.)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The camphor bottle
is a great mischief in the house, as camphor antidotes most of our
remedies. Camphor in potentized form will cure many complaints. It
is suitable in some acute complaints attended with nervous
excitement, even to frenzy, with spasms and convulsions and finally
exhaustion. The Camphor state is one of convulsions or coldness. In
the most acute period of the Camphor excitement, the excitability
and frenzy of the patient are extreme, or he goes into the other
extreme, in which the irritability is lost and there is loss of
sensation, unconsciousness and coldness. The two extremes may be
seen in one patient, one earlier and the other later. He may go
from the extreme of mental excitement and violence to one of
prostration and exhaustion, in which the body is blue and cold and
yet must be uncovered. In the mental state there is anxiety and
extreme fear; fear of persons, of strange spheres, of the dark; the
dark is filled with imaginary spectres; he dare not get out of bed
in the dark; everything that moves is a spectre and the inanimate
things of the room become alive and terrify him. Frenzy. Coupled
with this, there is kidney and urinary trouble, like that of
CANTHARIS, and because of this similarity, the two remedies are
both complementary and antidotal to each other. If a woman has
poisoned herself with CANTHARIS, and there is present the frenzy
and excitement, Camphor will act as an antidote.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The details of the
mental symptoms are worthy of much consideration. The patient goes
into a state not unlike imbecility, and the appearance is as if it
had come on slowly. The mind and memory are gone. He closes the
eyes, seemingly asleep, and answers no questions. Delirious with
the heat, rage and mania, wants to jump out of bed or out of the
window. Screams and calls for help. Tosses anxiously in bed.
Anxiety and almost loss of consciousness. These symptoms will
indicate Camphor in puerperal fever, in congestion of the brain, or
in shock from violent inflammation of organs. Confusion comes from
the shock and comes with violence. The more violently the patient
suffers, the sooner he is cold, and when he is cold, he must
uncover even in a cold room. This is somewhat like SECALE. In
SECALE the patient, when cold, wants to uncover and to be in a cold
room, and it also has frenzy, and so there is nothing in what we
have yet seen to distinguish SECALE from Camph. But there is
another thing that runs through Camph., by which a distinction can
be made. The coldness, frenzy and heat very often intermingle. When
the Camphor patient is becoming cold, he has spells of heat which
come over him; flashes of HEAT intermingle with rending, tearing,
burning pains, either in the inflamed organ or along the nerves.
The patient is a most troublesome patient to nurse; nobody and
nothing suits. If an inflammation of the bladder comes on, there is
intense pain and tenderness, and from the shock of the suffering,
the mind is in a state of frenzy. Coldness then comes on and the
patient wants to be uncovered, wants cold air, wants the windows
open, but before all this can be done, a flash of heat comes on and
then he wants the covers on, and the register turned on, and wants
a hot iron and hot bottles; but this stage now passes off, and
while the nurse is bringing the hot irons he wants her to open the
windows and have everything cool. You will see at once that these
are serious cases. This occurs with opisthotonos, convulsions,
inflammation of the brain, liver, kidney, bladder, coming on from
violent shock and cold with great exhaustion. You will see this in
one who has worked for hours for his life, and when the excitement
is over reaction sets in and it is like a whirlwind; he has worked
until he is exhausted and now he is prostrated, cold and blue; here
is the sphere where the old woman with her Camphor bottle has
established a reputation, but potentized Camphor will do more for
him than the Camphor bottle, it will put him into a refreshing
sleep.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It is useful in the
climacteric period with flushes of heat and sweat in a warm room;
the limbs and abdomen are very cold and she suffers from cold when
uncovered and sweats copiously when covered. She cannot endure
covering to warm her limbs though she suffers from cold.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The head is full of
pain; throbbing pain. Contractive feeling as if laced together in
the cerebellum. The whole back of the head and neck throb like
hammers; worse from bending head forward; burning and stinging.
Frontal headaches.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">We have heard about
Camphor in cholera, which is a disease that brings the patient down
quickly. The face is cold, blue and shrivelled, without much sweat,
in the cases that would make one think of Camphor. There is not
much discharge from the bowels, not much vomiting and not much
sweat; but suddenly he becomes cold, blue and collapsed, as it were
paralyzed and goes into a stupor.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">FACE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Convulsions with
frothing at the mouth. Blue lips, lock-jaw, tetanus. Cold sweat on
the face with vomiting. Erysipelatous appearance of
face.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOMACH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There is a desire to
drink without thirst. There is also insatiable thirst; he is not
satisfied with incredible quantities of cold water. Cannot get it
cold enough, and cannot get enough, but he soon vomits it
up.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The gastric
irritation is marked. Everything is vomited. The tongue is blue and
cold and the breath is cold. Everything coming out of the body is
cold. The air as it leaves the chest feels like that from a cellar,
like CARB-V.and VERAT. The tongue is cold and trembling. Such
states are found in cholera. All through the cold stage there is
burning. The inside of the body seems to burn, or there is a sense
of internal smarting like a rawness or a sense of burning without
heat.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The pain in the
stomach in gastritis is so violent that the anguish on the face is
equal to that in ARS.; a deathly anguish is felt in his stomach and
he feels that he must die. Burning, rending, tearing pain in the
stomach with retching and vomiting. Cramps in stomach and bowels
and spreading to other parts of the body until there are
convulsions and opisthotonos. Anguish at the pit of the stomach
drives him to despair. Heat in the stomach. Cold feeling in the
stomach. Abdomen is full of colic and burning. Cold feeling in the
abdomen.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOOL-RECTUM</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Cholera stools; rice
water discharges, with anxiety, restlessness, spasms of the
muscles, cramps of the chest, prostration, increasing coldness and
blueness; wants to be uncovered and he is going into collapse. The
old Camph., CUPR. and VERAT. still hold together for Asiatic
cholera. In Camph. there is prostration, blueness, coldness and yet
he wants to be uncovered and the body is cold and dry.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The other two
remedies have all there is in cholera, but in CUPR. there is not so
much coldness, more cramping, more convulsive tendency and not so
much prostration. The more cramping there is the more it is CUPR.
The more copious the discharge from the bowels and the more profuse
the vomiting and sweat, the more we would think of VERAT. Cold and
dry -Camph. Cold and copious discharge-VERAT.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">After taking cold
there is cutting, with involuntary discharge of dark brown faeces
like coffee grounds. Tenesmus. At times, the cholera patient, with
the coldness and blueness, is retching and straining to vomit and
suffering with horrible tenesmus to get rid of a little stool and
has convulsions here and there. These bowel symptoms gradually
increase until there is no ability to strain at stool, a paralytic
condition. The rectum seems contracted and painful.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">BLADDER</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There is suffering
in the urinary and sexual organs. Burning urination. Strangury.
Frequent urination. Frequent desire, with difficulty. The same
state arises in the bladder as in the rectum, and there is
retention with horrible torture. The patient sits on the commode
and strains to pass the urine, but there is a paralytic condition
of the bladder. The urine is red, bloody, and comes by drops like
CANTH. Tenesmus of the neck of the bladder.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-MALE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Camphor increases
the sexual erethism to an unbearable degree. In some cases from
large doses, this is seen in the extreme, and in other cases, the
reverse takes place. It has both sexual erethism and impotency in
its provings. I once knew a French woman who had an insane desire
to keep her boys always at home with her, and she thought she could
accomplish this if she could only keep them away from the girls;
and to destroy their sexual desire she kept a bag of camphor under
their pillows. All of them were made impotent. But in some provers
it establishes sexual erethism. It has this like CANTH.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE-RESPIRATION-CHEST</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Camphor produces a
coryza, with a profuse discharge from the nose and from the air
passages, from the nose to the bronchi. Bronchitis of children and
old people. Old withered up people take cold at every exposure to
weather and become cold and chilly. ANT-C., AM-C. and Camph. are
wonderful remedies in octogenarians. Every cold seems threatening.
Old people don't come down with cold the same as young people; they
are prostrated, sinking, have rattling in the chest and the family
think it is the death rattle, and that it is grandpa's last spell.
These three remedies fit the case; they are like the advanced stage
of pneumonia. ANT-T., ANT-C, AM-C. and Camph. cover these cases in
which the hot stage is omitted. Camph. has very little heat; it has
the sensation of heat; but not a marked hot stage. There are other
symptoms in this medicine such as you will find in old
people.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Jerking of the
muscles, trembling and jerking. Spasmodic conditions with
trembling. Trembling of the tongue.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">CHILL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The general
CONSTITUTIONAL state of a Camphor patient is coldness and extreme
sensitiveness to cold. In acute inflammatory conditions he is cold
and wants the covers off. In acute complaints, there is violent
thirst, in chronic complaints thirstlessness. It is the same in
ARS., in the acute thirsty, but in the chronic
thirstless.</span></p>
