<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">CANTHARIS</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8" style="tab-stops:left 123.15pt;"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Canth.)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The most important
feature of this medicine is the inflammatory condition, and the
most important characteristic in the inflammation is the rapidity
with which it develops into a gangrenous state. Inflammatory
conditions usually follow a definite course for days, but when this
medicine is put upon a part or taken internally the inflammatory
state terminates in death of the part with great rapidity. When
taken internally it proceeds almost immediately to attack the
urinary tract and establish a uremic state which brings about the
mental symptoms; the local inflammatory condition comes on with
great rapidity, and this brings the patient down violently sick in
a great hurry. From strong doses in the poisonous effect we get
startling and alarming symptoms; the whole economy is in disorder;
grievous symptoms commonly of the urinary tract. The parts become
gangrenous at an early stage.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The mental symptoms
are striking. Among those that are guiding is SUDDEN loss of
consciousness with red face. Suddenly goes into stupor. Confusion
of mind. Overwhelmed with strange ideas. Thoughts run riot, and go
whatever way they will, as if possessed by outside
influence.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Head hot, frenzy,
delirium, with GREAT EXCITEMENT AND RAGE, paroxysms renewed by
dazzling or bright objects, by touching the larynx or by trying to
drink water as in rabies. Fear and confusion of ideas. The mind
often runs towards subjects that the inflamed parts would suggest.
The bladder and genitals are inflamed and the excitement and
congestion of the parts often arouse the sexual instinct, so that
there are sexual thoughts and sexual frenzy. Violent amorous
frenzy, an excitement such as accompanies inflammation attended
with thoughts that correspond. The sexual instinct has gone mad.
The erections in the male are painful and violent. The penis is
inflamed and sore and it would be painful to have coitus, yet there
is this frenzy. Insolence. Blasphemy. Restlessness ending in rage.
Restlessness causing him to move constantly, a rage and delirium
intermingled with amorous frenzy. This kind of mental conduct in
Cantharis is similar to what will take place in HYOS., PHOS., and
SECALE, a violent delirious state intermingled with sexual ideas
and talk. In some instances, he deliriously sings lewd songs and
prattles on the subject of human genitals, urine and faeces, a wild
raving on subjects not talked about in health except among the
depraved. But in disease, chaste and modest persons, virgins, will
speak so that it is surprising where they have picked up such
language. In such cases, it is well to exclude everybody from the
room except the nurse and doctor. I have seen a dear old mother
weep and wring her hands and say: "Where did my daughter learn such
language?" The daughter is not to blame. It is simply a condition
of the urinary tract or the menstrual function, brought on from
cold or exposure, or through the mother's neglect to tell her
daughter what she should know in regard to her menstrual function,
and how there is inflammation of the ovaries or uterus, or outside
parts, and the urine burns and causes an inflammatory condition of
the outer parts, or the urine is retained and there is frenzy. Such
is Cantharis.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Violent, bursting,
lancinating headaches as if stabbed with a knife; an inflammatory
condition that takes hold of the mind violently.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Running all through
the remedy there is BURNING. In the head burning, throbbing and
stabbing. Unconsciousness and delirium in the mental state. Burning
in the side of the head. Stitches in the side of the head and
occiput. Lancinating pains deep in the brain. Hair falls
out.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE-FACE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It is seldom
indicated in eye troubles alone, except such as come with head and
mind symptoms. Erysipelas of the face with large blisters. Burning
in the eyes and the whole atmosphere LOOKS YELLOW. Burning and
smarting in the eyes. Erysipelas of the eyes, with gangrenous
tendency. Eyes hot, scalding tears. Erysipelas of the face, dorsum
of the nose, involving the lids. RHUS.-T., is more commonly used in
this condition, but when it is violent Canth. will often be
indicated and preferable to RHUS-T. RHUS-T. has the blisters and
the burning, but in Canth. between your two visits, the erysipelas
has grown BLACK, it is dusky, a rapid change has taken place, and
it looks as if gangrene would set in. Burning in the erysipelatous
area and the skin around burns FROM THE TOUCH. In RHUS-T. this is
not so. In Cantharis, the little blisters even if touched burn like
fire. ERUPTIONS BURN WHEN TOUCHED, ever so lightly, i.e., those
eruptions such as the remedy could produce.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This patient enters
into a state of prostration, is pallid, has hippocratic countenance
and dies. It corresponds to the lowest forms of disease, even
gangrene and violent inflammation of the bowels, bladder, brain,
spine and lungs; sinking and hippocratic countenance. Inflammation
of the lungs, gangrenous type, prostration and the lung that is
affected burns like fire, and immediately he expectorates
cadaverous smelling expectoration, thin, bloody, watery; it has
come on in an astonishingly rapid manner, and in a little while he
will die; the nose is contracted, there is the hippocratic
countenance, and the urine is suppressed. I remember one patient
who had just come out of a prolonged drunk. I left the patient in
the evening in just such a state as I have described. He was
drooling a bloody saliva from his mouth and he was dying. He had
had this condition come on in one night from being nearly frozen in
a drunk. It would be Cantharis or death before morning, but by
morning he was expectorating a rusty sputum and went on to a good
recovery. ARSENICUM has the burning in the lungs and he spits up
black sputum, pneumonia signs are present, with the restlessness
and anxiety, and other symptoms of ARS., and ARS. will stop it at
once. These violent remedies are needed in those cases that will
die.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">THROAT-STOMACH-ABDOMEN-STOOL</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Burning in the
throat. Great thirst, with burning in the throat and stomach.
Thirst, with aversion to all fluids, that is, the craving of the
mouth and throat are antagonized by the mental state. Thirst in the
throat and an aversion to water in the mind. Violent burning in the
stomach, pylorus, abdomen. The abdomen is swollen and tympanitic;
lancinating pains cutting and stabbing. Wherever there is a rapid
inflammation in the bowels, there is diarrhoea of bloody mucus or
serum, watery, bloody fluids from the bowels and
stomach.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The same watery
bloody fluid from the eyes. And wherever this watery fluid comes in
contact with the skin, it burns and excoriates. Bloody
urine.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Desire for stool
while urinating. The patient will sit on the commode with violent
tenesmus to pass urine and stool, feels that if he could only pass
a few more drops of urine or a little more bloody stool he would
get relief, but no relief comes. All the parts are inflamed and on
fire. Tenesmus and urging not only when the bladder is empty, but
often when the bladder is full. Retention of urine. Passes none or
only a drop or two. Violent tenesmus of the bladder. Cutting pains
with tenesmus. Lancinating, stabbing like knives, in neck of
bladder. Pains shoot off in different directions. Violent pains
with frequent urging. Constant tenesmus. An anxious state and
frenzy come on; most violent suffering and he has urging to pass
urine and stool with sexual erethism tantalizing in the extreme.
The whole urinary organs and genitalia are in a state of
inflammation and gangrene. Burning when urinating. This bloody
urine burns like fire in the bladder and about the genitals.
Retention or suppression of urine. It is rare that one suffering
from gonorrhoea has this violent inflammation, with burning and
tenesmus of the bladder and rectum, but in such a case, this remedy
is indicated. The intensity and rapidity are the features of this
remedy. It brings on pain and excitement found in no other remedy.
Next to it comes MERC-COR.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-FEMALE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the female, there
is oversensitiveness of all parts. Inflammation of the ovaries and
uterus. Burning in the vagina. Membranous dysmenorrhoea. Menses too
early, profuse, black.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Puerperal
convulsions. Retained placenta. Burning pains. When there have been
no expulsive pains present to expel the afterbirth, with the
symptoms running all through this remedy, after it has been given,
normal contractions of the uterus have come on with expulsion of
the membranes.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">BACK</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Violent lancinating
pains through the kidneys and back. Pains in the loins, kidneys and
abdomen. Pain on urinating, so that he moaned and screamed on
passing a drop.</span></p>
