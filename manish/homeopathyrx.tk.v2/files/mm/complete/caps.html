<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">CAPSICUM</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Caps.)</span><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Most of the
substances that are used on the table as seasoning in foods will in
the course of a generation or two be very useful medicines, because
people poison themselves with these substances, tea, coffee,
pepper, and these poisonous effects in the parents cause in the
children a predisposition to disease, which is similar to the
disease produced by these substances.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the fat, flabby,
red-faced children of beer drinkers and pepper eaters, with poor
reaction, a relaxed and flabby constitution, red face and varicose
condition, those that have been overstimulated, children of
overstimulated men, we find the sphere of Capsicum very often. In
those constitutions in which the face looks rosy, but it is cold or
not warm and upon close examination, the face is seen to be studded
with a fine system of capillaries. Plump and round, with no
endurance, a false plethora like CALC. The end of the nose is red;
the cheeks are red, redness over the cheeks, red eyes, easily
relaxed individuals. These constitutions react slowly after
diseases and do not respond to remedies, a sluggish state, and a
tired, lazy constitution. In school girls who cannot study or work,
who get home-sick and want to go home. In gouty constitutions, with
cracking of the joints and gouty deposits in the joints, stiff
joints, clumsy, weak, give out soon. There is sluggishness of the
whole economy. They are chilly patients, are sensitive to air, and
want to be in a warm room. Even in the ordinary weather, the open
air causes chilliness. They are sensitive to cold and to
bathing</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the mental state,
there is no more striking thing than this symptom- HOMESICKNESS. A
sickness like homesickness runs through the remedy and is
accompanied by red cheeks and sleeplessness, hot feeling in the
faces, fearfulness. They are oversensitive to impressions, are
always looking for an offence or slight; always suspicious and
looking for an insult. Obstinate to the extreme; it is a
devilishness. Even if she wants a certain thing, she will oppose it
if it is proposed by someone else. After emotions red cheeks, yet
with the red cheeks lack of heat, even with increased temperature;
or one cheek pale and the other red, or the cheeks alternately red
and pale. Children are clumsy and awkward.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Capsicum mind is
almost overwhelmed by persistent thoughts of suicide. He does not
want to kill himself, he resists the thoughts and yet they persist,
and he is tormented by these thoughts. There are persistent
thoughts in many remedies, and it is necessary to distinguish
between impulses and desires. If he desires to have a rope or a
knife to commit suicide, that is altogether different from an
impulse to commit suicide. An impulse is sometimes overwhelming and
overbalances the mind, and he commits suicide. You should always
find out from a patient whether he loathes life and wants to die,
or if he has impulses which he wishes to put aside. Some persons
lie awake at night and long for death, and there is no reason for
it. That is a state of the will, insanity of the will. In another
patient, the thoughts jump into his mind and he cannot put them
aside, and the thoughts are tormenting. The distinguishing feature
of the remedy is often found by differentiating between the two.
Desires are of the will; impulses come into the
thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Headaches as if the
skull would split when moving the head, when walking or coughing.
Feeling as if the head would fly to pieces; holds the head with the
hand. Feeling as if the head were large, aggravated by coughing and
stepping, ameliorated by lying with the head high. Bursting pain
and throbbing. Headache with pulsation in the forehead and temples.
Headache as if the brain would be pressed through the forehead. On
stooping, feeling as if the brain would be pressed out, as if the
red eyes would be pressed out on stooping.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The senses are
disturbed and are overacute; oversensitiveness to noise, smells,
taste and touch, to impressions, to insults. The patient is
excited.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EAR</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Pains in the ears;
itching pain; aching, pressing pain with cough, as if an abscess
would burst. It has a peculiar action on the bones of the internal
ear and mastoid process. Abscesses round about and below the ear
and caries; petrous portion of temporal bone necrosed. It has been
a frequently indicated remedy in mastoid abscess.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Old catarrhs. The
patient takes cold in the nose and throat and this is followed by a
collection of mucus. Very often in stupid patients it is difficult
to get symptoms, and you must depend on what you see, the character
of the discharge and a few other things, and you will find that
some of these cases will be cured and all the other symptoms will
go away; but in some of these old catarrhs no reaction seems to
come after the most carefully chosen remedies, and all at once the
doctor observes that the patient has a red face and it is cold and
the end of the nose is red and cold, and the patient is fat and
flabby and yet has not much endurance, never could learn at school,
and if she exerts breaks out into a sweat and freezes in the cold
air. He has a key to the patient and examines the patient by the
key, that is, by the drug, a bad practice and never to be resorted
to except as a DERNIER RESORT and in stupid patients. When he gives
Capsicum to that patient it arouses her, it may not cure; but after
it the SIL. or KALI-BI. or other remedy which was perhaps given
before and did not act takes hold and cures.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the text it says,
"Nose red and hot." The skin all over is red and burning, a
capillary congestion. The cheeks are red and hot, and this
alternates with paleness. Red dots on the face. Pains in the face
like bone pains, from external touch. Pains are worse from touch.
Pain in the zygoma or the zygoma is sensitive. Sensitive to
pressure over the mastoid. Swelling in the region of the
mastoid.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MOUTH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Taste foul like
putrid water. When coughing the air from the lung causes a pungent
offensive taste in the mouth. A HOT PUNGENT AIR COMES UP FROM THE
THROAT, tasting foul when coughing.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">On the tongue and
lips, flat, sensitive, spreading ulcers with lardaceous base. The
mucous membrane of the lips and various parts of the body if
pinched up with the fingers remain in the raised position, showing
a sluggish circulation. This is the flabbiness of Capsicum. It
wrinkles on pressure. It is a feeble circulation. The parts you
touch are loose and flabby, red, fat and cold. That child will not
react well if it has measles, until it gets Capsicum. The skin is
moist and cold, and there is a fine measly condition of the skin
due to capillary congestion. If the child is old enough it will
complain of feeling cold. There is slow reaction after eruptive
diseases, after glandular diseases, after bowel complaints. The
child was fat and flabby, but now does not take on
flesh.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">THROAT-NOSE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">He takes cold in the
throat and nose, and the throat looks as if it would bleed, it is
so red, a fine rash-like appearance &nbsp;it is puffed, discolored,
purple, mottled, flabby and spongy-looking; dark red. Burning
soreness with ulceration in the fauces. Uvula elongated. Stitching
in throat. Enlarged tonsils, inflamed, large and spongy. The throat
remains sore a long time after a cold or sore throat. Burning,
pressing pain in the throat, the throat dark red; relaxed sore
throat; pain on swallowing, dysphagia. Throat sluggish for weeks, a
do-nothing state, does not get very bad, but gets no better, a lack
of reaction.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOMACH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">When the chill
begins, there is thirst. Thirst after every dysenteric stool, a
sudden craving for ice-cold water, which causes chilliness. Craving
for water before the chill and when taken it hastens the chill; it
feels cold in the stomach. He desires something warm, something
stimulating, craves pungent things. This is seen in whisky
drinkers; they crave pepper, and the pepper, on the other hand,
turns round and craves whisky. These diffusible stimulants crave
some stimulating thing, crave support. Dipsomania.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Let me give you a
hint in ARSENICUM. In dipsomania, the sinners who have been
drinking a great many drinks in a day sometimes get to that state
in which they must get up during the night for a drink or they will
not be able to get up in the morning. In the morning, the first
three or four drinks will be thrown up, but the next one will stay
down; they must take a number until one sticks. They have got to
that state in which they must keep on taking it. If they sleep too
long the first few drinks will come up, and so they must get up in
the night or the whisky will not stay down in the morning until
they have taken a number of drinks. You will see this in lawyers
who do a great amount of work on stimulants. NUX-V., ARS., and
Caps, will do something for them if they will co-operate with you.
I remember saying to one old toper, who had kept up altogether on
champagne that he would have to stop it. He whined, "I don't think
it is worth while." If he could not get his champagne, he didn't
think life worth living. If these people want to get benefit, they
must co-operate.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOOL-BLADDER-PROSTATE GLAND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Dysentery. After
stool, tenesmus and thirst, and drinking causes shuddering.
Smarting and burning in anus and rectum. Violent tenesmus in rectum
and bladder at the same time. Haemorrhoids; protruding, smarting,
burning; smarting like pepper; they sting and burn as if pepper had
been sprinkled on them. Tenesmus of the bladder; strangury.
Burning, biting pain after urination. In old cases of gonorrhoea,
in which there is no reaction. THE DISCHARGE IS CREAMY. You take a
picture of his face, you notice the plethora, but also that he has
no endurance, plump, flabby, sensitive to cold, red face. He does
not react after cold. He has the last drop or a creamy discharge
with burning on urination. Capsicum will sometimes stop it
suddenly. Coldness of scrotum. Prepuce swollen, oedematous. Pain in
the prostate gland after gonorrhoea.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Coldness of the
affected part. Coldness in patches. Coldness of the whole

TRACHEA-COUGH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It is useful in
perplexing and troublesome chronic hoarseness. He has had a cold
and remedies for the acute condition have been given, perhaps two
or three remedies, ACON., BRY., HEP., PHOS., but all at once you
wake up to the fact of his chronic constitutional state of
hoarseness. He is rotund, chilly, red faced, and the hoarseness
disappears under Capsicum. It is the same with the cough. After
making several blunders you wake up and see it is a Capsicum case
and that you have never yet gotten at the root of the trouble. This
shows the importance of getting at the things general first. If
there is much acute suffering of course you must give an acute
remedy, but if the patient has delayed recovery and convalescence
is slow the next remedy should be the remedy for the patient.
Sometimes it is SULPH., PHOS., LYC., and sometimes it is Caps. If
the patient has a good constitutional state he will get over the
cold on the acute remedy, but the old gouty, rheumatic, flabby
patients need a constitutional remedy.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Cough in sudden
paroxysms, convulsing the whole body. Cries after the cough from
the headache. Stitches in the suffering part with the cough. Every
cough jars the affected joint. The constitutional state comes first
and the particulars must agree i.e., prescribe according to the
totality.</span></p>
