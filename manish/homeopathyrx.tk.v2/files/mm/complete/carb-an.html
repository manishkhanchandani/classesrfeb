<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">CARBO
ANIMALIS</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Carb-an.)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">PHYSICAL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Carbo animalis is
one of the deep-acting, long-acting medicines. Suitable in
complaints that come on insidiously, that develop slowly, that
become chronic and often malignant in character. Complaints in
anaemic, broken down constitutions. Vascular conditions. The
CARBONS affect the veins more or less, relaxing, paralyzing. This
one has its own peculiar feature of infiltrating little veins. Just
as sure as an organ in the Carbo animalis patient becomes
congested, it becomes hard and purple from infiltration, and has a
tendency to remain so. In an inflammation of a gland the veins
become weak and infiltrated, the gland itself becomes hard and
sore, the tissues around it indurate, and the skin over it becomes
purple. The glands of the throat and axillae grow purple and
indurated with no tendency to soften. Some of these medicines,
after infiltrating a gland, will hurry up the inflammatory action;
produce sloughing, rapid breaking down, with pus- like HEP., MERC.
and SULPH. But this medicine paralyzes and infiltrates the little
veins in the inflamed part, and there seems to be no tendency to
suppuration.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">We see that the
economy of this patient is in a sluggish state; there are no rapid
changes; but everything is slowed down. Even the inflammatory
process is a passive one. Very often a slow quasi-erysipelatous
inflammation comes on, the part becomes purple and will pit upon
pressure. Just think what a contrast this is to BELLADONNA.
BELLADONNA will inflame all the glands, they will swell, become hot
and so sensitive that they can hardly be touched; at first bright
red, then purple, with a tendency to resolution if let alone. But
the Carbo animalis inflammation comes on slowly, its progress is
slow, and there is no tendency to repair. Enlargement of veins here
and there over the body, varicose veins. There is intense burning
in the part inflamed, which is indurated and purple. The glands of
the throat burn. Sluggish buboes in old broken down constitutions,
in early stages of syphilis, inflame, become enlarged, purple, hard
and burn. Lumps in the mammary glands. A purple lump the size of a
hen's egg will form in the mammary gland. It does not go on to
suppuration, as you would expect it to, it just stays there. It
does not enlarge much, but it is hard.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The woman has so
much burning in the vagina that she persuades the physician to make
a more careful examination than he has done. He will probably find
the whole cervix inflamed, purple and somewhat enlarged. She says
it burns like coals of fire.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Carbo animalis
eventually produces ulceration of the tissues in various parts,
especially in glands. After a while- but not early in the case-an
ulcer forms, and perhaps after ulcerating for a time it comes to a
standstill; it has become a sluggish ulcer. Indurated ulcers. A
bubo breaks down and forms an ulcer. All at once it stops
suppurating and around about the tissues become hard and purple.
The laudable discharge ceases, a bloody, ichorous discharge takes
its place, and the surrounding parts burn. Now in ulcers and
fistulous openings, where the walls become hard and burn and the
discharge becomes acrid, Carbo animalis is frequently the
remedy.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It is not surprising
that this remedy has been one of the most suitable for old,
stubborn cancerous affections; for cancerous ulcers. They all burn,
they are all surrounded by infiltrated, hardened, dark-colored
tissue, and they all ooze an acrid ichorous fluid. It has cured
these troubles in old feeble constitutions with night-sweats and
much bleeding. It has relieved in incurable cases, and has
apparently removed the cancerous condition for years, even though
it comes back afterward and kills. This remedy is often a great
palliative for the pains that occur in cancer, the indurations and
the stinging, burning pains. Of course, we do not want to teach,
nor do we wish to have you infer, that a patient with a
well-advanced cancerous affection, such as scirrhus, may be
restored to perfect health and the cancerous affection removed. We
may comfort that patient, and restore order at least temporarily,
so that there is freedom from suffering in these malignant
affections. Most patients that have cancer are really in such a
state of disorder that only a temporary cessation of "hostilities"
can be expected; and anyone who goes around boasting of the cancer
cases he has cured ought to be regarded with suspicion. Do not
dwell upon the cancer, for it is not the cancer but the patient
that you are treating. It is the patient that is sick, and whenever
a patient is sick enough to have a cancer his state of order is too
much disturbed to be cured.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The proving of Carbo
animalis presents the appearance of a broken down constitution. It
brought out in the provers just such symptoms as occur in old,
feeble constitutions, with poor repair and lack of reaction. Hence
the medicine has been a great palliative for patients suffering
from malignant infiltrations and indurations; suspicious
indurations round about and under the bases of ulcers; suspicious
indurations in glands. A gland becomes inflamed, hard and remains
so. Carbo animalis stands at the head of the list of remedies that
have that condition.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">All through the
remedy there is hypertrophy. Tissues pile up here and there into
hard nodules; tissues pile up in glands and in organs. The economy
has lost its balance, and the result is a disorderly distribution
of material. Great prostration, want of energy, associated with
palpitation, anxiety and disorders of the pulse. Weak pulse, rapid
pulse, irregular pulse. Beating in blood vessels. There is turmoil
in the economy, sometimes described as heat. A rushing of heat as
though the body was full of steam. Awful sensation through the
chest and in the head, like some great earthquake taking place.
These are due to abnormal conditions of the venous side of the
heart. Flushes of heat; pulsations here and there. Haemorrhages.
And of course, the woman is more likely to bleed than the man;
hence, we have menses too early, too long, too copious. Prostration
with every menstrual flow. The Carbo animalis woman sinks down at
every menstrual period as if she would die. Such striking weakness
is not at all accounted for by the quantity of the flow. Chronic
induration, with enlargement of the uterus, which gradually grows
from year to year (AUR-M-N). Induration of the cervix and the whole
uterus. Copious flow of the leucorrhoea. Offensive uterine
discharges. Ulceration of the uterus, going gradually toward the
malignant state. The menses are black and offensive. Finally this
poor, feeble woman, who has been plodding along for years with this
condition, goes into malignant ulceration of the cervix, which
burns, bleeds constantly and oozes a foetid watery flow. The
burning pains in the uterus extend down to the thighs.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Whenever this
patient puts the child to the breast, she has a sensation of
emptiness in the stomach, sinking in the pit of the stomach, and
she must take the child away.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There are many
uterine troubles, with burning, stinging, smarting, a yellow brown
saddle over the bridge of the nose, something like the mottled
yellow saddle of SEPIA. All sorts of disordered conditions of the
uterus.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Surging of blood
upward to the head, rousing up in sleep, with horrible dreams. This
poor mortal is suffering from troubles in the base of the brain,
has tearing pains in the head, and especially of the occiput,
growing increasingly sensitive to cold, increasingly chilly,
increasingly waxy, until we have phthisis or cancer, with varicose
veins and all the conditions that I have described</span></p>
