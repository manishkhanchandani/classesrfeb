<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">CARBO
VEGETABILIS</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Carb-v.)</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">We will take up the
study of Vegetable Charcoal –Carb-v. It is a comparatively inert
substance made medicinal and powerful, and converted into a great
healing agent, by grinding it fine enough. By dividing it
sufficiently, it becomes similar to the nature of sickness and
cures folks. The Old School use it in tablespoonful doses to
correct acidity of the stomach. But it is a great monument to
Hahnemann. It is quite inert in crude form and the true healing
powers are not brought out until it is sufficiently potentized. It
is one of those deep-acting, long-acting antipsoric medicines. It
enters deeply into the life. In its proving it develops symptoms
that last a long time, and it cures conditions that are of long
standing-those that come on slowly and insidiously. It affects the
vascular system especially; more particularly the venous side of
the economy-the heart, and the whole venous system. Sluggishness is
a good word to think of when examining the pathogenesis of Carb-v.
Sluggishness, laziness, turgescence, these are words that will come
into your mind frequently, because these states occur so frequently
in the symptomatology. Everything about the economy is sluggish,
turgid, distended and swollen. The hands are puffed; the veins are
puffed; the body feels full and turgid; the head feels full, as if
full of blood. The limbs feel dull, so that the patient wants to
elevate the feet to let the blood run out. The veins are lazy,
relaxed and paralyzed. Vaso-motor paralysis. The veins of the body
are enlarged; the extremities have varicose veins.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The whole mental
state, like the physical, is slow. The mental operations are slow.
Slow to think; sluggish; stupid; lazy. Cannot whip himself into
activity, or rouse a desire to do anything. Wants to lie down and
doze. The limbs are clumsy; they feel enlarged. The skin is dusky.
The capillary circulation is engorged. The face is purple. Any
little stimulating food or drink will bring a flush to that dusky
face. When you see people gather round a table where wine is served
you can pick out the Carb-v. patients, because their faces will be
flushed; in a little while it passes off and they get purple again.
Dusky-almost a dirty duskiness. The skin is lazy;
sluggish.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Running through the
remedy there is BURNING. Burning in the veins, burning in the
capillaries, burning in the head, itching and burning of the skin.
Burning in inflamed parts. Internal burning and external coldness.
Coldness, with feeble circulation, with feeble heart. Icy coldness.
Hands and feet cold and dry, or cold and moist. KNEES COLD; NOSE
COLD; ears cold; tongue cold. Coldness in the stomach with burning.
Fainting. Covered all over with a cold sweat, as in collapse.
COLLAPSE WITH COLD BREATH, COLD TONGUE, COLD FACE. Looks like a
cadaver. In all these conditions of coldness the patient WANTS TO
BE FANNED.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Bleeding runs all
through the remedy. Oozing of blood from inflamed surfaces. Black
bleeding from ulcers. Bleeding from the lungs; from the uterus;
from the bladder. Vomiting of blood. Passive haemorrhagia. On
account of the feeble circulation a capillary oozing will start up
and continue. The remedy hardly ever has what may be called an
active gushing flow, such as belongs to BELLADONNA, IPECAC,
ACONITE, SECALE, and such remedies, where the flow comes with
violence; but it is a passive capillary oozing. The women suffer
from this kind of bleeding; a little blood oozing all the time, so
that the menstrual period is prolonged. Oozing of blood after
confinement, that ought to be stopped immediately by contractions.
There are no contractions of the blood vessels; they are relaxed.
Black venous oozing. After a surgical operation, there is no
contraction and retraction of the blood vessels. An injury to the
skin bleeds easily. The arteries have all been tied and closed, but
the little veins do not seem to have any contractility in their
walls. An inflamed part may bleed. Feeble heart; relaxed
veins.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Again, ulceration.
If you have a case, such as I have described, with relaxation of
the blood vessels and feebleness of the tissues, you need not be
surprised if there is no repair, no tissue making. So, when a part
is injured, it will slough. If an ulcer is once established, it
will not heal. The tissues are indolent. Hence, we have indolent
ulcers; bloody, ichorous, acrid, thin discharges from ulcers. The
skin ulcerates; the mucous membranes ulcerate. Ulcers in the mouth
and in the throat. Ulceration everywhere because of that relaxed
and feeble condition. Poor tissue making or none at all. "The blood
stagnates in the capillaries," is the way it reads in the
text.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">You can see how easy
it would be for these feeble parts to develop gangrene. Any little
inflammation or congestion becomes black or purple, and sloughs
easily-that is all that is necessary to make gangrene. It is a
wonderful remedy in septic conditions-blood poisoning-especially
after surgical, operations and after shock. It is a useful remedy
in septic conditions; in scarlet fever; in any disease which takes
on a sluggish form, with purplish and mottled appearance of the
skin.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In Carb-v. the sleep
is so full of anxiety that it may be said to be awful. On going to
sleep there is anxiety, suffering, jerking, twitching, and he has
the horrors. Everything is horrible. Horrible visions; sees ghosts.
A peculiar sluggish, death-like sleep, with visions. The Carb-v.
patient wakens in anxiety and covered with cold sweat. Exhaustion.
Unrefreshed after sleep. And thus the whole patient is prostrated
by his sleep. So anxious that he does not want to go to sleep.
Anxiety in the dark. Anxiety with dyspnoea as if he would
suffocate. Anxiety so great that he can not lie down.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In Carb-v.,
indifference is a very prominent symptom. Inability to perceive or
to feel the impressions that circumstances ought to arouse. His
affections are practically blotted out, so that nothing that is
told him seems to arouse or disturb him. "Heard everything without
feeling pleasantly or unpleasantly, and without thinking about it."
Horrible things do not seem to affect him much; pleasant things do
not affect him. He does not quite know whether he loves his wife
and children or not. This is a part of the sluggishness, the
inability to think or meditate, all of which is due to the
turgescence. Sluggishness of the veins. Head feels full; distended.
His mind is in confusion and he cannot think. He cannot bring
himself to realize whether a thing is so or not, or whether he
loves his family or not, or whether he hates his enemies or not.
Benumbed; stupid. There is another state-anxiety and nightly fear
of ghosts; anxiety as if possessed; anxiety on closing the eyes;
anxiety lying down in the evening; anxiety again on waking. He is
easily frightened. Starting and twitching on going to
sleep.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The headaches are
mostly occipital. His whole head is turgid, full, distended. He
feels as if the scalp was too tight. Everything is bound up in the
head. Awful occipital headaches. Cannot move, cannot turn over,
cannot lie on the side, cannot be jarred, because it seems as if
the head would burst, as if something was grasping the occiput.
Dull headache in the occiput. Violent pressive pain in the lower
portion of the occiput. Head feels heavy. When the pain is in the
occiput the head feels drawn back to the pillow, or as if it could
not be lifted from the pillow. Like OPIUM; he cannot lift the head
from the pillow. Painful throbbing in the head during inspiration.
The Carb-v. patient takes short breaths, quietly, keeping just as
still as possible, until finally, he is compelled to take a deep
breath, and it comes out with a sharp moan. Headache as from
contraction of the scalp. Painful stitches through the whole head
when coughing; the whole head burns. Intense heat of the head;
burning pain. Rush of blood to the head followed by nose-bleed.
Congestion to the head with spasmodic constriction, nausea, and
pressure over the eyes.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A feeling as of an
oncoming coryza from an overheated room. Many of these headaches
come on from taking cold, from coryza, from slacking up of an old
catarrh. The Carb-v. patient suffers from chronic catarrh. He is at
his best when he has a free discharge from the nose, but if he
takes cold and the discharge stops congestion to the head comes. He
cannot stand suppression of discharges. Headaches come on every
time he takes cold; from cold damp weather; from going into a cold
damp place and becoming chilled. Awful occipital headache, or
headache over the eyes, or headache involving the whole head, with
pounding like hammers. These states are like KALI BICHROMICUM, KALI
IODATUM and SEPIA. Many of these headaches are due to stopped
catarrhal conditions.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The hair falls out
by the handful. Eruptions come out upon the head. School girls and
boys, too, who are sluggish, slow to learn, and suffer from night
terrors; they will not sleep alone, or go into a dark room without
someone with them. They have headaches, worse from, pressure of the
hat. A long time after taking off the hat, they still feel the
pressure. Sweat, cold sweat; particularly sweat of the head and of
the forehead. The Carb-v. patient breaks out into a copious sweat,
appearing first on the forehead, and the sweat is cold. The
forehead feels cold to the hand, and any wind blowing upon it will
produce pain; he wants it covered up. Head sensitive to cold. If he
becomes overheated and his head perspires, and then a draft strikes
that sweating head, his catarrh will stop at once and headaches
will come on. His knees and hands and feet get cold, and he sweats
without relief.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The eye symptoms are
troublesome, and they often occur along with the headache. Burning
pain in the eyes. The eyes become lustreless, deep-set, and the
pupils do not react to light. He feels sluggish mentally, and does
not want to think. He wants to sit or lie around, for every
exertion gives him a headache. Whenever this state is present, the
eyes show it. You know he is sick because the bright, sparkling
look has gone out of his eyes. If he could only get somewhere by
himself and lie down-provided it was not dark-he would be
comfortable. He wants to be let alone; he is tired; his day's work
wears him out. He comes home with a purple face, lustreless eyes,
sunken countenance, tired head and mind. Any mental exertion causes
fatigue. Weight in the head, distress and fulness in the head, with
cold extremities. The blood mounts upward. Haemorrhages from the
eyes; burning, itching and pressing in the eyes. The eyes become
weak from overwork or from fine work.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Carb-v. is one of
the medicines for discharges from the ears. Offensive, watery,
ichorous, acrid and excoriating discharges, especially those dating
back to malaria, measles or scarlet fever-particularly to scarlet
fever. A sluggish condition of the venous system. The veins seem to
be most affected in all old complaints, especially whenever a
patient says of himself, or a mother says of her child, that he has
never been quite well since an attack of malarial fever. The
daughter has never been quite well since she had the measles, or
typhoid fever, or scarlet fever Carb-v. is one of the medicines to
be thought of when symptoms are in confusion, and the patient has
been so much doctored that there is no congruity left in the
symptoms. Old ear discharges, or old headaches, when all the
symptoms have been suppressed. It is then Carb-v. often becomes one
of the routine remedies to bring symptoms into order and to
establish a more wholesome discharge from that ear. It brings about
reaction, establishes a better circulation and partially cures the
case, after which a better remedy may be selected.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Inflammation of the
parotid glands, or mumps. When mumps change their abode, from being
chilled, and go in the girl to the mammary glands, and in the boy
to the testes, Carb-v. is one of the medicines to restore order;
very often it will bring the trouble back to its original place,
and conduct it on through in safety. Pains in the ear. Passive,
badly-smelling discharges from the ear. Loss of hearing. Ulceration
of the internal ear. Something heavy seems to lie before the ears;
they seem stopped; the hearing is diminished, especially in those
cases that date back to some old trouble.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Carb-v. patient
is always suffering from coryza. He goes into a warm room, and,
thinking he is going out in a minute, he keeps his overcoat on.
Pretty soon he begins to get heated up, but he thinks he will go in
a minute and he does not take off his coat. A procedure like that
is sure to bring on a coryza. It will commence in the nose, with
watery discharge, and he will sneeze, day and night. He suffers
from the heat and is chilled by the cold; every draft chills him;
and a warm room makes him sweat, and thus he suffers from both. He
can find no comfortable place, and he goes on sneezing and blowing
his nose. Perhaps he has bleeding from the nose. At night he is
purplish. The coryza extends into the throat and brings on rawness
and dryness in the mouth and throat. A copious watery discharge,
filling the posterior nares and the throat. Then he begins to get
hoarse, and in the evening he has a hoarse voice, with rawness in
the larynx and throat. Rawness in the larynx on coughing; soreness
to the touch. The more he coughs the worse the rawness becomes.
This condition extends into the chest. Secretion of much thin
mucus, finally becoming thick yellowish-green, and bad-tasting.
Such is the coryza. Now, with it there comes a stomach disturbance
that is commonly associated with Carb-v. complaints. Great
distension of the abdomen with gas. With this coryza, he has
belching, and sour, disordered stomach. Every time he disorders his
stomach, he is likely to get a coryza. Every time he goes into an
overheated room, he is likely to get a coryza, with sneezing, chest
complaints, and catarrh.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This catarrhal state
in the nose is only a fair example of what may occur anywhere where
there is a mucous membrane. Catarrhal conditions with a flow of
watery mucus and bleeding. Carb-v. has catarrhs of the throat,
nose, eyes, chest, and vagina. Old catarrhal conditions of the
bladder; catarrh of the bowels and stomach. It is pre-eminently a
catarrhal remedy. The woman feels best when she has more or less of
a leucorrhoea it seems a sort of protection. These discharges that
we meet every day are dried up and controlled by local treatments,
by washes, and by local applications of every kind-and the patient
put into the hands of the undertaker, or made a miserable wreck. If
these catarrhal patients are not healed from within out, the
discharges had better be allowed to go on. While these discharges
exist, the patient is comfortable. It is quite common for the Carb-
v. patient to be feverish with the coryza, but with many other
complaints he is cold; cold limbs; cold face; cold body; cold skin;
cold sweat. It is not so common for the earlier stages of the
coryza, and the catarrhal conditions to have these cold symptoms.
He is feverish in the evening and at night. But after he passes
into the second stage, when the mucus is more copious, then come
the cold knees, cold nose, cold feet, and cold sweat,</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">FACE</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The face of Carb-v.
is a great study. In the countenance and in the expression we see
much that is general. The patient shows his general state in his
expression, especially in the eyes. He tells you how sick he is; he
tells you the threatening points. In Carb-v. there is great pallor
and coldness, with lips pinched and nose pointed and drawn in. Lips
puckered, blue, livid, sickly, deathly. Face cold, pale, and
covered with sweat. As the tongue is protruded for examination it
is pale and cold, and the breath is cold, yet he wants to be
fanned. This is true whether it be cholera, diarrhoea, exhaustive
sweats, or complaints after fevers. Sometimes, after a coryza has
run its course and ended in the chest, there is great dyspnoea,
copious expectoration, exhaustive sweat, great coldness- and the
patient must be fanned. Cough followed by dyspnoea, exhaustion,
profuse sweats, with choking and rawness-and he wants to be fanned.
Cold face; pinched face. So the sufferings are expressed in the
face. The pains and aches, and anxiety and sorrow are all expressed
in the face. The study of the face is a delightful and profitable
one. The study of the faces of remedies is very profitable. It is
profitable to study the faces of healthy people that you may be
able to judge their intentions from their facial expressions. A man
shows his business of life in his face; he shows his method of
thinking, his hatreds, his longings, and his loves. How easy it is
to pick out a man who has never loved to do anything but to eat-the
Epicurean face. How easy it is to pick out a man who has never
loved anything but money-the miserly face. You can see the love in
many of the professional faces; you can single out the student's
face. These are only manifestations of the love of the life which
they live. Some manifest hatred; hatred of the life in which they
have been forced to live; hatred of mankind; hatred of life. In
those who have been disappointed in everything they have undertaken
to do we see hatred stamped upon the face. We see these things in
remedies just as we see them in people. The study of the face is a
most delightful one. A busy, thoughtful and observing physician has
a head full of things that he can never tell-things he knows about
the face. So the face expresses the remedy. In Carb-v. the face
flushes to the roots of the hair after a little wine. This is a
strong characteristic. All over the body, the skin will become
flushed. Sometimes a flush appears in islands, which grow together
and become one solid flush, creeping up into the hair. So great is
the action of this remedy upon the capillary circulation that
sometimes, a tablespoonful of wine is sufficient to cause this
flushing of the skin.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The old books talk
about "scorbutic gums;" now we call it Rigg's disease-a separation
of the gums from the teeth. Bleeding of the gums; sensitiveness of
the gums. Separation of the gums from the teeth. The teeth get
loose. We hear about "the teeth rattling in his mouth." The CARBONS
produce just such a state, a settling away and absorbing of the
gums. They get spongy and bleed easily and hence looseness of the
teeth with bleeding of the gums, which are very sensitive. Teeth
decay rapidly. Bleeding of the gums when cleaning the teeth. Teeth
and gum affections from abuse of MERCURY. Teeth feel too long and
are sore. Drawing and tearing in the teeth. Tearing in the teeth
from hot, cold or salt food; pain from both heat and cold. This is
in keeping with the general venous condition of the whole
system.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Sensitiveness of the
tongue. Inflammation of the tongue. In certain low forms of fever,
like typhus and typhoid fevers, the gums turn black-that is, they
throw out a blackish, bloody, offensive, putrid exudate. If
disturbed or touched they bleed; and the tongue piles up that
blackish exudates-that oozing of black blood from the veins. This
is present in putrid forms of fevers like the typhoid-in zymotic
states. This remedy is rich in those zymotic symptoms, such as are
described in common speech as "blood-poisoning." Carb- v. is a
sheet-anchor in low types of typhoid; in scarlet fever where a
typhoid condition is coming upon the case, and in the last stages
of collapse; in cholera, and in yellow fever at the time of
collapse, where there is coldness, cold sweat, great prostration,
dyspnoea-wants to be fanned. Great prostration with cold
tongue.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The mouth and throat
are filled with little purple aphthous ulcers, which were little
white spots to begin with, but they have grown purplish and now
ooze black blood. These aphthous patches bleed easily, burn and
sting. Blisters form. Smarting, dryness of the mouth with bleeding
aphthous ulcers. These are common features of Carb-v. in any of the
mouth and throat conditions.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">THROAT</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Tough mucus in the
throat; bloody mucus in the throat. These little ulcers run
together, spread, and become one solid mass. A large surface will
become ulcerated, denuded of its mucous membrane, and then it will
bleed. Little black spots come upon it. Food cannot be swallowed
because the throat is so sore. Generally the throat feels
puffed.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOMACH</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Carb-v. patient
has a longing for coffee, acids, sweet and salt things. Aversion to
the most digestible things and the best of food. For instance,
aversion to meat, and to milk which causes flatulence. Now, if I
were going to manufacture a Carb-v. constitution I would commence
with his stomach. If I wanted to produce these varicose veins and
the weak venous side of the heart, this fullness and congestion,
and flatulence, this disordered stomach and bowels, and head and
mind troubles-sluggishness of the economy-I would begin and stuff
him. I would feed him with fats, with sweets, puddings, pies and
sauce, and all such indigestible trash, and give him plenty of
wine-then I would have the Carb- v. patient. Do we ever have any
such people to treat? Just as soon as they tell their story, you
will know enough about their lives to know that they are mince pie
fiends; they have lived on it for years, and now they come saying,
"Oh, doctor, my stomach; just my stomach; if you will simply fix up
my stomach." But what are you going to do with him? He has made
himself into a Carb-v. patient for you and it may be quite a while
before you can bring him down to a sensible diet. Now he must begin
at the foot of the ladder. I only brought this up to show how a
Carb-v. patient is produced and what kind of a stomach he has, and
what he has been living on. He has burning in the stomach,
distension of the stomach, constant eructations, flatulence, and
passing offensive flatus. In reality, he is in a foetid condition,
a putrid condition. His sweat is offensive. He has heartburn;
eructations; the stomach regurgitates the food that he
takes.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Carb-v. has much
vomiting at the end of the chill. Vomiting and diarrhoea. Vomiting
and blood; with the vomiting of blood the body is icy cold; breath
cold. The pulse is thready and intermittent. Fainting; hippocratic
face; oozing of thick black blood. Vomiting of sour, bloody,
bilious masses.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There is an
accumulation of flatus in the stomach, so that the stomach feels
distended. All food taken into the stomach seems to turn into
flatus; he is always belching, and is slightly relieved for a while
by belching. Carb-v. has cramps in the bowels and stomach; burning
pain; anxiety; distension. All these symptoms are ameliorated by
belching, or passing flatus. Amelioration from belching seems quite
a natural event; but when we study CHINA, you will see that the
patient appears to be aggravated from belching. The idea is that
the patient gets relief from belching, from eructation, but under
LYCOPODIUM and CHINA it seems that no relief comes. They belch
copiously and yet seem just as full of wind as ever, and sometimes
even seem to be worse. The Carb-v. patient experiences a decided
relief from eructation. This is a particular symptom, but it
becomes almost general, and sometimes quite general. Headaches are
relieved by belching; rheumatic pains are relieved by belching;
sufferings and distensions of various kinds are relieved by
eructations.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This abdominal
fullness aggravates all the complaints of the body. The fullness,
which is described as if in the veins, is sometimes in the tissues,
under the skin, so that it will crepitate. This is a feature of
Carb-v., and, in rheumatic conditions, part of the swelling is
sometimes of this character. Food remains a long time in the
stomach, becomes sour and putrid. It passes into the bowels and
ferments further, finally passing off in the form of putrid flatus.
There is colic, burning pains, distension, fullness, constricting
and cramping pains from this distension. The patient complains of
feeling as if the stomach were raw. This is described as a
smarting, sometimes from taking food; sometimes from taking cold
water. Carb-v. has cured ulceration of the stomach. It is a
deep-acting medicine; arid is capable of curing all disordered
conditions of the stomach; such as disorders from eating
indigestible things, mince pie, too hearty food.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">ABDOMEN</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In Carb-v. the
liver, like all the other organs, takes on a state of torpidity and
sluggishness. It becomes enlarged. The portal system is engorged,
and hence haemorrhoids develop. Pain and distension in the region
of the liver; sensitiveness and burning in the liver, accompanied
by a bloated condition of the stomach and bowels. A feeling of
tension in the region of the liver; the part feels drawn, as if too
tight. There are pressing pains in the liver, and it is sensitive
to touch.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Much that I have
said regarding the flatulence and fullness of the stomach applies
also to the abdomen. Carb-v. may be indicated in low forms of
fever, as in septic fever, when there is a marked tympanitic
condition, with diarrhoea, bloody discharges, distension and
flatulence. Extremely putrid flatus escapes making the patient very
offensive. A striking abdominal symptom of Carb-v. is that the
flatus collects here and there in the intestine as if it were in a
lump; incarcerated flatus; a constriction of the intestine will
hold it in one place so that it feels like a lump or tumor, that
finally disappears. Colic here and there in the abdomen from
flatus. There is burning in the abdomen. No matter what the trouble
is, in Carb-v. there is always burning. The part burns; it feels
full; it becomes engorged and turgid with blood. Diarrhoea,
dysentery, cholera, when there is a bloody, watery
stool.</span></p>

stool mixed with mucus; watery mucus mixed with blood. The child
sinks from exhaustion, with coldness, pallor and cold sweat. The
nose, face and lips are pinched and hippocratic. With all
diarrhoeic troubles, the prostration will indicate Carb- v. as much
as, if not more than, the stool. In the diarrhoea of Carb-v. all
the stools, no matter what kind, are putrid, with putrid
flatulence. The more thin, dark bloody mucus there is, the better
is the remedy indicated. Itching, burning and rawness of the anus
and round about are strong features of Carb-v. Soreness-in all
diarrhoeic conditions-soreness to pressure over the abdomen. Round
about the anus, in children, there is excoriation. The parts are
red, raw and bleeding, and they itch. Itching of the anus in
adults. Ulceration of the bowels. This tendency to ulceration of
mucous membranes is in keeping with the character of the remedy.
Whenever there are mucous membranes, there may be ulceration.
Aphthous appearance. Ulceration of Peyer's glands. The patient lies
in bed and oozes involuntarily a thin bloody fluid, like bloody
serum.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Old chronic
catarrhal conditions of the bladder, when the urine contains mucus,
especially in old people, with cold face, cold extremities and cold
sweat. There is suppression of urine.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In both the male and
the female organs, there is a weakness and relaxation. The male
organs hang down. Relaxation of the genitalia; cold and sweating
genitals. The fluids escape involuntarily.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the woman, the
relaxation is manifested by a dragging down sensation; dragging
down of the uterus, as if the internal parts would escape. The
uterus drags down so that she cannot stand on her feet. All the
internal organs feel heavy and hang down.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Another strong
feature of Carb-v. is dark, oozing haemorrhagia from the uterus. It
is not so often a copious, gushing haemorrhage-the remedy has that
also-but it is an oozing. The menstrual flow will ooze from one
period almost to another. The blood is putrid and dark, even black,
with small clots, and considerable serum escapes with it. It says
in the text: "Metrorrhagia from uterine agony." Atony is a good
name for the condition; lack of tone; relaxation; weakness of the
tissue. Atony is everywhere present in the Carb-v. constitution.
The muscles are tired, the limbs are tired, the whole being is
tired and relaxed. This is in contradistinction to the gushing
found in BELLADONNA, IPECACUANHA, SECALE and HAMAMELIS, where the
blood escapes in great gushes, followed quite naturally by a
contraction of the uterus, for there is more or less tonicity in
connection with it. In Carb-v., either in connection with
confinement or menstruation, or in an incidental haemorrhagia, the
uterus does not contract. Sub involution from mere atony; no
contraction; no tonicity; weakness and relaxation. After
menstruation, confinement and the various complaints that woman is
subject to, there is a period of weakness that Carb-v. often fits.
When there is a retained placenta, with scanty haemorrhagia-just an
oozing, with no tendency to a gush of blood-the physician remembers
that throughout the whole pregnancy and confinement there has been
sluggishness and slowness of pains, and he says: "Why did I not
think of Carb-v. before?" The woman has needed Carb-v. for a month.
He administers a dose, and before he has time to think about it,
the uterus will expel that placenta and fix up matters so nicely
that he will not need the mechanical interference that might
otherwise have been necessary.</span></p>

so much about this meddlesome midwifery, this curetting, and doing
this and that and the other thing, that it makes a homeopathic
physician disgusted. Just as if those parts were not made by
nature, and could not take care of themselves; as if they must be
swabbed out and syringed out. These injections and bichlorides,
etc., to keep the germs out of a woman are all nonsense. If a state
of order is maintained there will be no germs. A homeopathic
physician can manage hundreds of these cases, and have no trouble.
If he sees clearly beforehand what remedy the woman needs there
will be no bad cases; they will all take care of themselves.
Irregular contractions that bring on abnormal conditions are all
avoided if the woman is turned into order before she goes into
confinement. Carb-v. is one of the medicines that prepares a woman
well for confinement, that is, the symptoms calling for Carb-v. are
often present in such conditions. She is often run down, relaxed
and tired. Pregnancy brings about a great many unusual conditions.
There is the nausea in pregnancy; the flatulence; the
offensiveness; the weakness; the enlarged veins. They will tell you
that the enlargement of the veins of the lower limbs is from
pressure, but it is generally not from pressure, but from weakness
of the veins themselves.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Suppression of milk;
prostration or great debility from nursing. It is not natural for a
woman in a healthy state to become prostrated when nursing her
child. She becomes so because she is sick. She was in a state of
debility before she began nursing, and the weakness should be
corrected by an appropriate remedy. Then she can make milk and feed
her child without feeling the loss of it. Such is the state of
order. Carb-v. is a friend to the woman, and a friend to her
offsprings. You will be astonished, after ten years of real
homeopathic practice, that you have so few deformed babies that
they have all grown up and prospered; that their little defects and
deformities have been outgrown, and that they are more beautiful
than most children, because they have been kept orderly. The doctor
watches and studies him, and feeds him a little medicine now and
then that the mother suspects is sugar, to keep on the good side of
the baby. She need not know that it is medicine, or that anything
is the matter with the baby. So he watches the development of that
little one, and grows him out of all his unhealthy tendencies. The
children that grow up under the care of the homeopathic physician
will never have consumption, or Bright's disease; they are all
turned into order, and they will die of old age, or be worn out
properly by business cares; they will not rust out. It is the duty
of the physician to watch the little ones. To save them from their
inheritances and their downward tendencies is the greatest work of
his life. That is worth living for. When we see these tendencies
cropping out in the little ones we should never intimate that they
are due to the father or mother. It is. only offensive and does no
good. The physician's knowledge as to what he is doing is his own,
and the greatest comfort he can get out of it is his own. He need
never expect that anyone will appreciate what he has done, or what
he has avoided. The physician who desires praise and sympathy for
what he has done generally has no conscience. The noble, upright,
truthful physician works in the night; he works in the dark; he
works quietly; he is not seeking for praise. He does this when
called to the house, and when members of the family bring little
ones to the office. In this manner, children can be studied and
their symptoms observed and enquired into. Whenever the mother
brings the child, expecting medicine, she may know that he is
receiving medicine, but when she does not ask for medicine let her
suspect that Johnnie is getting sugar so the doctor can get on the
good side of him. That is sufficient.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">LARYNX AND
TRACHEA</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In Carb-v. the voice
manifests a great many symptoms. I described a part of them when
going over the coryza. I explained how it began in the nose, and
travelled to the throat, the larynx, and the chest. Now many of the
complaints of the larynx begin with a cold in the nose, which
finally locates permanently in the larynx -and in that way we bring
out the Carb-v. cases. It is only now and then that the Carb-v.
cold settles in the larynx first; it usually travels through the
nose. Most remedies have a favorite place for beginning a cold. For
instance, the majority of PHOSPHORUS colds begin in the chest or
larynx. Not so with Carb-v.; its cold generally begins in the nose,
with a coryza, and the larynx is simply one of the stopping places.
If the Carb-v. cold goes down into the chest it may have its ending
in the bronchial tubes or the lungs. This is a favorite place for
it to settle, and it seems as if it were going to remain there.
Weakness in the larynx from talking. Tired larynx of speakers and
singers, and feeble, relaxed persons. THE HOARSENESS COMES ON IN
THE EVENING. The larynx may be fairly well in the morning, but as
soon as it becomes evening, his voice becomes husky. In more
serious forms, he may be speechless in the morning, but hoarseness
and huskiness in the evening are more characteristic. Huskiness and
rawness in the evening. Rawness in the larynx when coughing. Some
will say there is burning, some will say rawness. Rawness in the
larynx and trachea when coughing. A continual formation of mucus in
the larynx, which he has to scrape and cough out. We see the same
tendency to weakness in the mucous membranes. No tendency to
repair; no tendency to recover. He goes on from bad to worse, with
a catarrhal condition of the larynx and trachea. Hoarseness and
rawness from talking, worse afternoon and evening. He is obliged to
clear his throat so many times in the evening that the larynx
becomes raw and sore. Let me tell you another thing about the
Materia Medica. Most of the provers were laymen, and hence there is
some confusion of terms in the provings. This the physicians must
see. Irritation in the throat from coughing nearly always means
irritation in the larynx, though the prover said "throat." Now here
is an expression, "obliged to clear his throat so often in the
evening that the larynx becomes raw "and sore." Clearing the throat
would not make the larynx sore. Scraping the throat does not scrape
the larynx; but he is obliged to clear his LARYNX so often that the
part feels raw. Ulcerative pain, scraping and titillation in the
larynx. Irritation in the larynx causing sneezing. Laryngeal
phthisis. This catarrhal condition and lack of repair in the larynx
goes on so long that tuberculosis begins.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">COUGH</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Carb-v. is one of
the greatest medicines we have in the beginning of whooping cough.
Its cough has all the gagging, vomiting and redness of the face
found in whooping cough. It is one of our best medicines when the
case is confused; when the cough indicates no remedy or when it
remains in a partially developed state. A dose of Carb-v. in such
cases will improve matters very much, and minor cases of whooping
cough may be wiped out in a few days. When the remedy does not cure
permanently, it brings out more clearly the symptoms calling for
another remedy. Most cases of whooping cough, in the care of a
homeopathic physician, will get well in a week or ten days under a
carefully selected remedy. When allowed to run, they continue a
long time, gradually increasing for six weeks, and then declining
according to the weather. If it is in the fall, the cough will
sometimes keep up all winter; so whooping cough furnishes an
opportunity for the homeopathic physician to demonstrate that there
is something in Homeopathy.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Carb-v. patient
suffers very much from difficulties of breathing. Suffocation;
cannot lie down. A feeling of weakness in the chest, as if he could
not get another breath. Sometimes it is due to cardiac weakness,
and sometimes to stuffing up of the chest. The latter is most
common. Sometimes the difficulty is asthmatic. The remedy cures
asthma. We will see the patient propped up in a chair by an open
window, or some members of the family may be fanning him as fast as
possible. The face is cold, the nose pinched, the extremities cold
and he is as pale as death. Put the hand in front of the mouth, and
the breath feels cold. The breath is offensive; putrid. The
extremities are cold clear to the body; not only the hands, but the
whole upper extremities; and not only the feet, but the limbs clear
to the body, are cold. The body only feels warm; even the skin is
cold.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Carb-v. has a
rattling cough with retching and vomiting. A morning, cough, with
much rattling in the chest; the chest fills with mucus, and on
endeavouring to expectorate he coughs and gags, or coughs and
vomits. At any time during the day a peculiar choking, gagging,
retching cough may develop from the mucus in the chest. He cannot
get it up; it is tough, purulent, yellow and thick. Greatly reduced
vitality; great relaxation; worn out persons, old people. Persons
worn out from coughing or from prolonged exertion. Prostration.
Catarrh of the chest, with copious expectoration.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">At times, there will
be a hard, dry hacking cough, but finally, after prolonged
coughing, it commences to loosen and he throws up great quantities
of mucus. A dry, hacking cough, yet there is rattling in the chest,
and the cough does not seem to do any good. He seems to cough and
become exhausted, sweats and strangles. It seems as if he would
suffocate with the cough. Finally, he succeeds in getting up some
mucus, and then follows mouthful after mouthful of thick purulent
expectoration. Frequent attacks of spasmodic cough in violent
paroxysms lasting for many minutes, sometimes an hour. Cold sweat,
coldness and pinched appearance of the face. This increases as he
goes into the paroxysm of coughing. His face looks haggard, so
distressed does he becomes while in a paroxysm of coughing. This
state is present in old phthisical cases, in the advanced stage,
when they are incurable. Under such circumstances Carb-v. furnishes
an excellent palliative. It seems to strengthen the muscles of the
chest so that the patient can expectorate better. It mitigates the
cough; the gagging and retching and dyspnoea are relieved, and he
is temporarily improved. It is a wonderful palliative in many
incurable conditions with dyspnoea and weakness of the chest. In
Bright's disease, in phthisis, and in cancerous affections Carb-v.
stops the violent symptoms and mitigates greatly.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This remedy is one
to begin whooping cough with. It simplifies the case greatly, and
sometimes cures it in a few days. The patient coughs until the
chest is sore, as if he had been beaten all over the chest. All
night he has paroxysms of coughing. He sleeps into a paroxysm of
coughing, like LACH. He rouses up from sleep with coughing,
gagging, sweating and suffocation. He will go two or three hours
without a paroxysm, and then on comes one that will last an hour.
He has two or three hard paroxysms of coughing during the night. He
commences to fill up, he hears the rattling breathing and he knows
that before long he will have a hard time of it.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This goes on, and
on, to the end of his life in asthmatic cases-what is called "humid
asthma." Real humid asthma comes on in persons who suffer from
contractions of the small bronchial tubes, so that even at the best
there are little whistlings in the chest. Every time such patients
take cold their whistling increases. They expectorate mucus, at
first copious, then tough and finally purulent. During all this,
there is great asthmatic dyspnoea. Carb-v. is an excellent remedy
in all those cases of asthma where the shortness of breath is so
marked that there is only a partial oxidation, as a result of which
he suffers much from occipital headache and wants to be fanned. Old
cases of recurrent asthma. Every time there comes a warm wet spell,
his asthma comes on. It is common for Carb-v. asthma to come on in
the night. He goes to bed without warning of an oncoming attack,
only he says, "I don't like the weather;" and he wakes up with
asthma. He wakes up suffocating, springs out of bed and goes to the
window or wants to be fanned.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Carb-v. is required
in old, badly-treated cases of pneumonia, with a remaining
bronchitis; in cases where there has been hepatization that was not
cleared up, and there are bad places in the lungs and bronchial
tubes, with weakness of the chest. Weakness of the chest when
coughing. He feels that there is not enough force in the muscles of
the chest to get up a good cough, or to help him carry on the
breathing. Pneumonia, third stage, with foetid expectoration, cold
breath, cold sweat, desire to be fanned. Threatened paralysis of
the lungs. This is a combination of clinical states that the remedy
covers well. Sometimes these asthmatic cases go on for a while, and
then comes an infiltration of tubercle. If Carb-v. can be given
early it will prevent infiltration.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There is pain in the
chest, and burning. Burning in the lungs; burning in the sides of
the chest; burning with the cough; burning behind the sternum-the
whole length of the trachea; burning aggravated when coughing; a
sense of rawness even when breathing. He feels a load upon the
chest, an oppression, a great weight. These are the various words
that he uses, all descriptive of the same thing.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The heart comes in
for a great deal of trouble. It appears to be struggling. Of
course, it is the venous side of the heart that is in distress. The
veins are engorged. It is a venous condition of the whole patient;
the veins are performing their labor with great difficulty. A state
of relaxation, struggling, and there are orgasms of blood-described
by some of the authors as an orgasm, by others as a tumultuous
action of the heart felt throughout the body. Pulsation felt all
over the body. Flushes of heat mounting upwards, ending in a sweat.
Suitable sometimes for women at the turn of life. Especially
suitable to persons in advanced years.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Carb-v. complaints
come on in a weakly state in young people; as if it were a
premature old age in the middle-aged people; or in the breaking
down that naturally belongs to old age. It is a great comforter for
aged people with enlarged veins, or fullness of the veins and
coldness of the extremities. Oozing of blood, with
palpitation-tumultuous action of the heart. The pounding goes on
like a great machine, shaking the whole body.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The pulse is almost
imperceptible. It seems as though the volume of blood ought to be
tremendous, but it is not. Weakness of the whole vascular system.
Pulse irregular, intermittent, frequent. Blood stagnates in the
capillaries. Complete torpor; impending paralysis of the heart.
Burning in the region of the heart. With this, there is an awful
feeling of anxiety in the chest-in the region of the heart-as if he
were going to die, or as if something were going to happen. He
feels that tumultuous action and tires out under it.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In going over the
remedy, I have said so much about the limbs, their coldness and the
cold sweat, that I have practically covered most of the symptoms
that belong to the extremities. Carb-v. is an excellent remedy for
the general constitutional disorder where there are indolent
varicose ulcers upon the lower limbs-the legs above the ankles.
There is no activity in these ulcers; thin watery discharge or it
is thick, bloody and ichorous. Burning indolent ulcers; varicose
ulcers; swelling of the limbs. A gangrenous state from the
extremely feeble circulation. Gangrenous condition such as old
people have senile gangrene. The limbs wither; the toes and lower
parts wither and look dusky. There are blisters upon them and they
ooze a bloody, watery fluid. Burning like fire. Loss of sensation.
Stiffness in the joints. Excoriating sweat between the toes, and
numbness. Numbness in the limb lain on. If he lies on the right
side, the right hand gets numb. It he turns over on the left side,
the left arm gets numb. The circulation in the part is so feeble
that if there is any pressure the part becomes numb. The surface is
cold. The extremities are cold. He is indolent, weak and always
tired, with an aversion to mental and physical work. Every little
exertion brings on a feeling as if he would faint and
collapse.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The sleep is full of
dreams. He wakes up with dyspnoea, wakes with cold limbs,
especially cold knees. Legs drawn up during sleep. Unrefreshed
after sleep. The dreams he has are the kind that most of these
patients have where the remedy acts so violently upon the veins,
upon the basilar portion of the brain, and upon the voluntary
system. They are awful. He dreams of fire, burglars, fearful and
horrible things. Anxiety, restlessness and congestion of the head
prevent his going to sleep. Rush of blood to the head. His head
feels hot, but to the hand the skin feels cold. The inner chest
feels as if burning, but the outer chest feels cold to the hand. So
it is in the abdomen. The feeling of internal heat and burning,
with external coldness, is a common feature of Carb-v.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The fever is
violent; it has a violent rigor or chill. Of course, during the
chill he is cold, but there is one strange feature, he wants cold
water during the chill, and when the fever comes on he has no
thirst. That is strange; it is uncommon. It is common for patients
to be thirsty when they are hot with fever, and when cold not to
ask for water. It is common not to ask for water during sweat. But
in this patient you observe coldness, rigor, cold breath, and even
in the chill sometimes a cold sweat and you say that it is peculiar
that he drinks so much cold water. It is strange; it is uncommon;
rare. Hence, it is one of the strong features of Carb-v. febrile
conditions.</span></p>

with great thirst.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Low forms of fever
like yellow fever, and a very low type of typhus and typhoid
fevers. After the fever has somewhat subsided he has prolonged cold
spells with lack of reaction. He does not seem to rally, but he is
cold, his knees are cold, his breath is cold, cold sweat, a sort of
paralytic weakness. Cadaveric aspect of the face. Cyanotic face.
Coldness of the limbs yellow fever in the last stage, the stage of
haemorrhagia, with great paleness of the face. Violent headache,
trembling of the body; collapse with cold breath, cold sweat, cold
nose. Nose and face pinched. Vital powers very low, tells a great
deal of the story of Carb-v. Lack of reaction after some violent
attack, some violent shock, some violent suffering. In weakly
persons who give right out, with dyspnoea, coldness, copious sweat,
exhaustion, collapse and cadaveric aspect, Carb-v. must be
given.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Carb-v. is indicated
after surgical shock, when the patient goes into collapse, and is
in danger of dying from the shock of the operation. This is before
inflammation sets in, for there is not vitality enough to arouse an
inflammation. The heart is too weak to establish reaction enough
for an inflammation. Inflammation comes after a reaction. But if
reaction does not take place, Carb-v. is one of our most important
remedies.</span></p>
