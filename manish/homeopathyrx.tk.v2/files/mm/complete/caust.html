<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">CAUSTICUM</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Caust.)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Causticum is a very
searching medicine, suitable in old, broken down constitutions,
suffering from chronic diseases. Only occasionally is it indicated
in acute diseases. Its complaints are such as are progressive,
slow, and accompanying a declining state of the economy. Gradual
decrease of muscular power, a paralysis. Paralysis of the
oesophagus, paralysis of the throat, such as occurs after
diphtheria; paralysis of the upper eyelids; paralysis of the
bladder; paralysis of the limbs, of the lower limbs; great
lassitude, muscular relaxation, indescribable fatigue and heaviness
of the body. And there is a tremulousness, a quivering, jerking,
twitching of the muscles, twitching in sleep.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The next most
striking feature is found in the tendons, which become shortened,
resulting in a temporary or permanent contracture, and the limb is
drawn up. Tendons of the forearms contract, and there is gradually
increasing flexion. Sometimes a whole muscle will harden and
shorten, so that it can be felt by the hand as a hard ridge.
CONTRACTURES OF MUSCLES AND TENDONS.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Closely related to
this is a rheumatic state of the tendons and ligaments about the
joints, sometimes with swelling, but always with pain and ending in
a shrivelling of the joint, a tightening tip of the joint so that
it becomes ankylosed. Great stiffness of the joints, and while this
is going on the patient is growing weaker, is running into a state
of melancholy, of hopelessness, anxiety and fear. Constantly
present in his mind is the hopelessness and a feeling that
something is hanging over him, that something is going to happen.
These are general features of Causticum. They all go to make up one
picture, they are inseparable.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Another kind of
progressive trouble in Causticum is hysteria. Gradually increasing
hysteria. Hysterical cramping. The woman loses all control of
herself and says foolish things. Her nervous system becomes
extremely sensitive to noise, touch, excitement or anything
unusual. Starting from the slightest noise; starting in sleep;
twitching and jerking; the child is easily startled, or acts as if
startled without cause.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The paralytic
weakness is associated with the rheumatic diathesis. The rheumatic
states are peculiar. The patient himself can endure neither heat
nor cold. They both aggravate his rheumatic conditions, his nervous
conditions and himself in general. His pains are ameliorated by
heat, but they are aggravated in dry weather. Great deformity of
the joints; they are enlarged, soft and infiltrated, always worse
in dry weather; more pains and aches during dry weather. Rheumatism
that affects both the muscles and the joints. This patient is also
aggravated by exposure to cold, dry winds. Many an individual who
has gone from the low lands of the East up into Colorado will come
down with rheumatism from the cold, dry winds. Let such a patient
as I have described take a ride in the cold lake wind and he will
have paralysis of the side of the face exposed to the wind. A long
drive with the east wind coming against the face. The next day that
side of the face will be paralyzed. Such a paralysis will almost
always recover under Causticum.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Rending, tearing,
paralytic pains; pains that benumb; pains that fairly take the life
out of him, they are so severe. And they are likely to remain in
one place for a long time. Causticum has often greatly mitigated
the lightning-like pains of locomotor ataxia.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Now, with all these
sufferings the patient is slowly growing weaker, till at length he
can no longer walk, he can no longer sit up, he is so tired and
weak that he must lie down. He is tired in body and mind. It is a
paralytic fatigue.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Convulsive symptoms.
Cramps, now here, now there. If frightened he is almost sure to
have some form of convulsive condition. The woman with tendency to
hysteria will have hysterics from fright; nervous girls that are
more inclined to chorea, will start with jerking of muscles and
will keep it up day and night. Chorea even at night. Localized
chorea, jerking of single parts, chorea of the tongue or of one
side of the face.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Epilepsy in young
persons at the age of puberty, from fright, from being chilled or
exposed to some great change in the weather. Epilepsy, chorea,
paralysis, hysteria worse during menses. We see that Causticum is a
deep medicine. Worse from exposure to cold, dry wind. It also has
rheumatic complaints aggravated in the warm, damp days, in wet
weather, but this is not so striking.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Any one of the
complaints that I have mentioned may be brought on by bathing in
cold water. A long, dry, cold spell will aggravate the rheumatic
troubles, getting wet or becoming chilled by bathing will start
them.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Causticum has cured
insanity; not acute mania with violent delirium, but mental
aberration of the passive kind, where the brain has become tired.
The constitution has been broken down with long suffering and much
trouble, and finally the mind is in confusion. At first, the
patient recognizes his inability to do anything and then comes this
foreboding that something is going to happen. He is unable to
think, and consequently unable to carry on his business. He is
going into imbecility. Full of timorous fancies. "Timorous
anxiety," overwhelmed with fearful fancies. At every turn, there is
fear that something is going to happen. Fear of death, fear that
something will happen to his family. Always anticipating some
dreadful event. That is a striking feature of the Causticum mental
state. It is found in old, broken down mental cases, after
prolonged anxiety; after a prolonged struggle of some sort. Anxiety
before falling asleep. In addition to this, the Causticum patient
lacks balance. Everything excites him. The more he thinks about his
complaints the worse they become. Mental and other ailments from
long-lasting grief and sorrow. The injurious effects of fear and
prolonged vexation. Tired from vexations of business. The
suppression of eruptions is apt to bring out mental symptoms.
Mental exhaustion, hopelessness, despair, appearing after the
suppression of an eruption with zinc ointment. He was fairly well
while he had the eruption, but when it disappeared his mind gave
out.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Eruptions on the
side of the head and face, and extending over the whole head.
Thick, crusty eruptions covering the whole occiput. When these
eruptions are suppressed in children, chorea is apt to follow. In
the adult, there will be trembling, paralytic weakness and the
mental state, sometimes pains in the nerves. The driving in of a
facial eruption will frequently result in facial paralysis. The
healing of an old ulcer with stimulating lotions and ointments will
have a similar result. Then he also suffers from violent headaches,
congestive, pulsating headaches; violent stitches in the head,
worse in the evening. But the headaches are, as a rule,
nondescript; only occasionally do we find a Causticum headache
standing out by it. It will usually be associated with rheumatic
and gouty conditions which also affect the scalp. The scalp
contracts and tightens up in places like the contractures in other
parts. Rheumatic headaches; sometimes the pain is so severe as to
cause nausea, and vomiting. Blinding headaches followed by
paralysis. Torticollis. The head is sometimes drawn to one side by
the shortening of the muscles of the neck. Causticum is a curative
remedy in this shortening of the tendons and muscles.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Causticum is rich in
eye symptoms. Very often, the patient says that the eyelids feel so
heavy that he can hardly hold them up. This gradually increases
until it becomes an actual paralysis. Sometimes there is the
appearance of a veil before the eyes; foggy vision. Flickering
before the eyes. Air seems full of little black insects. Then,
again, large black or green spots are seen. After looking at the
light, a green spot appears and remains in the field of vision for
a long time. Diplopia. And the vision gradually grows weaker until
it is lost. Paralysis of the optic nerve. Lachrymation, tears
acrid, burning; ulceration, copious discharges from the eyes,
agglutination of the lids, paralysis of the eye muscles. Causticum
cures scrofulous ophthalmia with ulceration of the cornea; chronic,
purulent ophthalmia of psoric origin. The cornea is covered with
little veins.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Another very strong
feature of this medicine is its tendency to grow warts. Warts on
the face, on the tip of the nose, on the ends of the fingers, on
the hands. Hard, dry, horny warts come out on various parts of the
body.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EAR</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It is a natural
feature of this remedy to produce copious, thick, tough, gluey
discharges from mucous membranes. The catarrhal troubles creep up
the Eustachian tube, from the nose and throat into the ear,
resulting in roarings, cracking noises and reverberations in the
ear. There is great accumulation of ear wax; deafness of catarrhal
origin and deafness from paralysis of the auditory nerve. Severe,
dragging pains in the ear.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The nasal catarrh is
very troublesome. Old, atrophic catarrh with accumulation of crusts
throughout the whole nasal cavity; post-nasal catarrh with
ulcerations, granulations and copious, thick, yellow or
yellowish-green discharge; nose-bleed; frequent attacks of acrid,
watery coryza. Much itching of the nose. A wart grows upon the tip
of the nose.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">FACE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The pains in the
face are violent. Neuralgic pains from exposure to cold. These
pains often accompany the facial paralysis. Tearing pains in the
face, stitching pains, pains of a rheumatic character.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Ulcerations about
the mouth and nose. Fissures about the lips, the wings of the nose
and the corners of the eyes. Fissures seem to form upon the least
provocation. Fissures of the anus, of the skin about the joints.
Old cases of salt rheum with fissures in the bends of the joints.
Fistulous openings with indurated walls.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MOUTH-TEETH-THROAT</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The gums become
scorbutic and settle away from the teeth; bleeding and ulceration
of the gums. Violent, tearing pains in the roots of the teeth from
riding in the wind. Old rheumatic subjects suffer all through every
dry spell with toothache. Stitching, tearing, pulsating pains in
the teeth; even in the sound teeth on drawing in cold air.
Frequently recurring abscesses of the gums. Putrid sour or bitter
taste in the mouth.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">When the paralytic
condition affects the tongue then we have stammering. There is also
the condition of complete paralysis of both the pharynx and
oesophagus. Hence Causticum is useful in the results of diphtheria
when it has been maltreated or when the remedy has not been
sufficient to cure the disease. The food goes down the wrong way or
enters the larynx or the post-nares. Paralysis of the organs of
speech, paralysis of the tongue, awkward at talking, awkward at
chewing; bites the tongue and cheeks while chewing.
Post-diphtheritic paralysis is a serious condition and only a few
remedies can cure it. Causticum is one of them. LACHESIS and
COCCULUS are also important. Dryness of the mouth and throat;
rawness of the throat; must swallow constantly on account of a
sensation of fullness in the throat, a nervous feeling in the
throat. This is often a forerunner of paralysis. The STAPHISAGRIA
patient when excited will keep up a constant swallowing and this
goes on until it becomes a source of great annoyance. Burning in
the throat; jerking in the throat; constantly scraping thick, tough
mucus from the larynx. Study the sounds that patients make in order
to ascertain where the mucus comes from. The presence of hoarseness
shows that the trouble is in the larynx.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOMACH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Causticum
patient sits down to the table hungry, but on seeing the food his
appetite vanishes. The thought, sight or smell of food takes away
the appetite. This is a common symptom in the pregnant woman.
Although hungry, on sitting down at the table, she cannot eat. KALI
CARBONICUM has an empty, all-gone feeling in the stomach, with
aversion to food. CHINA has canine hunger, but loathes the sight of
food.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Thirst after eating;
thirst for cool drinks with aversion to water; desire for beer,
smoked meats, pungent things, aversion to sweet things and
delicacies. Most remedies that have loss of appetite have desire
for sweet things, pastry, etc. The symptoms of thirst with aversion
to drinking is very much like LACHESIS. The two run very closely
together in the paralytic condition of the throat.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There is a queer
sensation in the stomach as if lime were slaking there. Trembling
in the stomach; burning. Bread causes a sensation of heaviness and
pressure; coffee seems to aggravate all the symptoms of the
stomach, but a swallow of cold water relieves. Many symptoms in
this remedy are made better by a swallow of cold water. The
violent, spasmodic cough may be stopped at once by a drink of cold
water. Cold water seems to tone up the paralytic condition. Warm
water applied to the hands brings on pains in these old sensitive
spinal conditions. Cold washing is their only relief.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">ABDOMEN-RECTUM-STOOL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Causticum has
belching, nausea, vomiting, distension and violent pains in the
stomach. Pinching colic. In the rectum, there is the same tendency
to paralytic weakness that is found in other parts of the body. It
is inactive and fills up with hard faeces, which pass involuntarily
and unnoticed. ALOE has involuntary dropping of little, hard balls,
especially in children. Even when old enough to understand about
such things, they will pass little balls unnoticed.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">On account of the
paralytic condition the stool passes with less straining while the
patient is standing. Retention of urine except when standing;
unable to pass it in any other position is SARSAPARILLA.
Constipation, frequent, unsuccessful urging to stool. The stool is
tough and shining, and is passed with great difficulty and
exertion.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">FISSURES IN THE
ANUS; itching and stitching in the rectum, excessive itching day
and night; haemorrhoids; pulsating in the perineum; fissures and
haemorrhoids pulsate and burn like fire. The haemorrhoids become
infiltrated and hardened.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">BLADDER-URINE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This remedy has two
kinds of paralysis of the bladder, one arresting the muscles of
expulsion and the urine is retained, and the other centering upon
the sphincter vesicae, and then the urine is passed involuntarily
"He urinates so easily that he is not sensible of the stream and
scarcely believes, in the dark, that he is urinating, until he
makes sure by sense of touch." Causticum is unconscious of the
stream as it passes. It is a very useful remedy in children that
wet the bed. Especially is it a wonderful remedy in the woman. THE
URINE ESCAPES INVOLUNTARILY WHEN COUGHING. Retention of urine in
the woman. Retention after labor. Paralysis of the bladder. A woman
who is too greatly embarrassed to pass through a crowd of observing
men to the closet at the end of a railroad car, at the end of the
journey finds that she is unable to pass the urine. Retention of
urine from straining the muscles of the bladder. If the patient is
chilled at the time the remedy may be RHUS-T. RHUS-T and Causticum
are the two great remedies for paralytic weakness of muscles from
being overstrained, or from being overstrained and
chilled.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-FEMALE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Great weakness at
the time of the menses. Anxious dreams before menstruation;
melancholy; cramp-like spasms; pains in the back. The woman suffers
from many annoyances during menstruation. Just about the time for
the flow to start violent cramp-like pains come on. In a woman who
is nursing a child the milk almost disappears in consequence of
fatigue, night watching and anxiety. The nipples get sore and crack
another instance of the tendency to form fissures.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">LARYNX AND
TRACHEA</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Causticum
patient has trouble with the voice. You remember, when we were
going over the symptoms of CARBO VEGETABILIS, I told you that the
hoarseness was worse in the evening. Now observe that the
hoarseness of Causticum is worse in the morning. He gets up in the
morning with a hoarse voice; if it is an ordinary case, after
moving about and expectorating a little mucus, it is better. Sudden
loss of voice from paralysis of the vocal cord. It sometimes begins
with the morning aggravation, gradually increasing until it lasts
all day and all night.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">COUGH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Causticum cough
is a hard cough and racks the whole body. The chest seems full of
mucus and he feels if only he could COUGH A LITTLE DEEPER he could
get it up, and he struggles and coughs until exhausted or until he
finds out that a drink of COLD WATER WILL RELIEVE. But it must be
ice cold. The cough is hollow, it sounds as if he were coughing
into a barrel. It is relieved by expectoration if it can only get
deep enough to reach the mucus. Sometimes such a cough precedes
quick consumption. It is a deep-acting medicine; it cures phthisis,
especially mucous phthisis or quick consumption. "Cough with a
sensation as if the patient could not cough deep enough to start
the mucus; produced by tickling, accompanied by rawness. Cough
wakens her from sleep in the evening and morning. Cough relieved by
a swallow of cold water. Cough worse by bending forward. Continual,
annoying cough; with each cough escape of urine." Influenza with
tired aching of the limbs as if they had been beaten. "Whooping
cough in the catarrhal stage."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">CHEST</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Great soreness and
tightness of the chest, oppression of the chest; it feels as if a
load were upon it. It seems to be filling up with mucus, and the
patient coughs until he raises a mouthful and then he feels a
little better for a time. Pale as death, covered with
sweat.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">BACK</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There are many
symptoms in the back. Pain and stiffness; stiffness on rising from
a seat. Stiffness in the limbs, through the hips and in the back,
so that he rises up from sitting or the recumbent posture with
great difficulty. In most cases, the pains and aches are
ameliorated by the warmth of the bed and by applied heat. Only the
pains in the fingers are sometimes brought on by heat.</span></p>
