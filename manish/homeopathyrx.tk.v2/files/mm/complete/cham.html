<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">CHAMOMILLA</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Cham.)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The general
constitutional state of Chamomilla is GREAT SENSITIVENESS;
sensitive to every impression; sensitive to surroundings; sensitive
to persons; and, above all, SENSITIVE TO PAIN. The constitutional
irritability is so great that a little pain brings forth
manifestations as if the patient were in very great suffering. It
naturally belongs to the woman's nervous system, when she is
wrought up and extremely sensitive and in pain.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The mental state
goes along with this. Sensitiveness of the mind. Great
irritability. These two run through Chamomilla so closely that they
are inseparable. SENSITIVENESS TO PAIN. EASILY affected by
mortification, by chagrin, so that the nerves become extremely
sensitive from these causes, and pains, convulsions, colic,
headaches and other kinds of nervous symptoms set in. The nervous
child when punished will go into convulsions. The oversensitive
nervous woman will suffer from chagrin. Jerking and twitching of
muscles from mortification and excitement. Excessive sensibility of
the nerves, so excessive that only a few remedies equal it, such as
COFF., NUX-V. and OPIUM. Of course, without hearing a lecture on
OPIUM you naturally think of OPIUM as capable of producing stupor.
Those of you who have seen the awful state of mind and distress
that follow the administration of the crude OPIUM will understand
what I mean by the Chamomilla sensitivity.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">PHYSICAL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Convulsions of
children. It is not an uncommon thing, even now-a-days, and
especially when practicing in the country, for the young mothers
and the nurses to give the baby Camomile tea for colic, and the
baby goes into convulsions. No one attributes it to Camomile tea,
but the doctor will see at once, if he knows Chamomilla, that these
convulsions are due to Camomile. Then you see the jerkings, the
convulsions, the hot head, the great sensitivity; sensitiveness to
noise, and to persons, and the great irritability between the
convulsions. Convulsions of children; they become stiff; roll the
eyes; distort the face; twitchings of muscles; throw the limbs
about; clinch the thumbs; bend the body backwards. Such is the
natural appearance of the Chamomilla convulsions; those convulsions
that come on in oversensitive children, when they have suffered a
good deal of pain from teething. Teething ought to be a perfectly
healthy process, but it is really looked upon as a disease, and
many doctors carry medicines for "teething children," and
administer them; first one and then another. Chamomilla has fallen
into that bad use of being given "for teething." It is true that
many children suffer from irritability of the brainy convulsions,
stomach disorders and vomiting about the time of dentition, but I
say dentition should not be a diseased state, it should be normal.
If they were in health, they would cut teeth without sufferings.
But slow teething we have to contend with, and that irritable
state, that oversensitiveness, so that the child does not sleep.
Wakes up as if it had awful dreams. Wakes up in excitement, vomits,
has diarrhoea-green, slimy diarrhoea, like chopped grass. Offensive
diarrhoea with teething. These symptoms come at this time when the
child has not been properly looked after. Or perhaps the mother has
not been properly qualified for parturition. "Tetanic convulsions.
Twitching in the eyelids. Pain in the limbs. General prostration,
faintness." Neuralgic pains all over the body with numbness.
Twitching, darting, tingling pains. The pains are mostly
ameliorated by heat, with the exception of the teeth and jaws.
Toothache, pain in the teeth ameliorated by cold, and made worse by
heat. But the earaches and pains in the extremities are made better
by heat.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">You will see in the
text under "Temperature and Weather" the symptom "Pains are worse
from heat," with two black bars as if it were the most important
symptom in it, and then below, without any bar, "Sensitive to cold.
Chilly," and "Better from heat;" but the fact is the pains that are
worse from heat are about the teeth and jaws, and it is decidedly a
particular symptom relating only to a part; whereas it is true that
the patient in the general state, entirely contrary to what this
says, is better by heat. The pains in general are better by heat.
The patient himself is better by heat. Consequently, this being a
particular, it should state that the pains that are so commonly
worse by heat are of the teeth.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The most important
part of Chamomilla is the mental state. It pervades the whole
economy and you will see that every region that is taken up, every
part that is studied brings into it the mental state of the
patient. This remedy has more mental symptoms than symptoms in any
other part. Crying. "Piteous moaning. Irritable." The irritability
is so great that it manifests itself sometimes in a very singular
way. The patient seems to be driven to frenzy by the pains, and she
forgets all about her prudence and her diplomacy. Loss of
generosity; she has no consideration for the feelings of others.
She will simply enter into a quarrel or dispute regardless of the
feelings of anybody. So, when you go into practice, do not be
surprised when you go to the bedside of a patient in labor, who is
full of pains and sufferings, if she says: "Doctor, I don't want
you, get out." Just such a one will pass under other circumstances
as a lady. The awful pains that she is having drive her to frenzy,
and this frenzy, this oversensitiveness to pain, is coupled with
the mental state. Inability to control her temper and the temper is
aroused to white heat. Now, in the child the child whines and cries
and sputters about everything. It wants something new every minute.
It refuses everything that it has asked for. If it is for something
to eat, for something to play with, for its toys, when these are
handed to the child it throws them away; slings them clear across
the room. Strikes the nurse in the face for presuming to get
something or other that the little one did not want, yet had asked
for. CAPRICIOUSNESS. It seems that the pains and sufferings are
sometimes ameliorated by passive motion, this very particularly in
children. The pains seem to be better when the child is carried, so
the child wants to be carried all the time. This is true in the
colic and in the bowel troubles. It is true with earache; it is
true with the evening fevers and the general sufferings from cold
and conditions while teething. CHILDREN MUST BE CARRIED. The nurse
is compelled to carry the child all the time. And then there is the
restlessness and capriciousness about the members of the family.
The child goes two or three times up and down the room with the
nurse, and then reaches out for its mother; goes two or three times
up and down the room with her and then wants to go to its father.
And so it is changing about. Never satisfied. It seems to have no
peace. When it has earache, the sharp shooting pains cause the
child to screech out. Carries the hand to the ear. The pains often
cause that sharp, piercing tone of the voice. Adults in pain cannot
keep still the pains are so severe; it is not always that they are
decidedly ameliorated by moving, but they seem to be. But they move
because they cannot keep still. So the Chamomilla patient is
tossing in bed, if in bed; not an instant quiet. And along with all
of these the same irritability; becomes violently excited at the
pain; angry at the pain; irritable about the pain; will scold about
the pain; the pain is so torturesome. Aversion to talk and
snappish. The patient is constantly sitting and looking within
herself when pains are absent.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Chamomilla has
melancholy, and has suffering of the mind, without pain. Then the
Chamomilla patient sits and thinks within herself-a sort of
introspection. Cannot be induced to say a word. Sadness. The
Chamomilla child cannot be touched. Wants to do as he pleases.
Wants to change; wants to do something new. The answer from both
the adult and the child are snappish. Complaints come on from
contradiction; from anger. Convulsions come on from anger. If the
child is suffering from whooping cough, it will have a coughing
spell, a spasmodic cough from being irritated. Goes into a spunky
state, gets red in the face, and then gets to coughing.
Peevishness. "Quarrelsome. Easily chagrined or excited to anger.
Bad effects of having the feelings wounded." Such is the mental
state, and, as I have remarked, that mental state will be found
wherever there is an inflammatory condition that Chamomilla fits.
In pneumonia, in bronchitis, laryngitis, inflammations of the ear,
erysipelas, headaches, fevers, Chamomilla is capable of curing when
the mental state is present, and the symptoms in particular, are
present.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The headaches of
Chamomilla are found in sensitive people, sensitive women. Nervous;
overstrained; overtired. Fidgety. Excitable women that suffer from
pain. A little headache seems an enormous thing. Throbbing,
tearing, bursting pains. Congestive headaches. Worse when thinking
of the pain, or when thinking about the sufferings. The headaches
are worse evenings. A particular time in the evening for many
complaints to be worse is 9 o'clock. Sometimes 9 o'clock in the
morning, and sometimes 9 in the evening. Fever conditions worse 9
o'clock in the morning. Pains worse in the evening, and especially
worse about 9 o'clock. Stitching, tearing pains in the temples and
head. Wandering pains in the temples. Pressing pain in the head as
soon as attention was directed to it, better by busying the mind at
something else, or by occupation; forcing one's self to do
something, and to think of something else. Congestion to the head.
Violent neuralgia of the face, teeth, ear, sides of the head. Pains
inside of the mouth are ameliorated by cold. Pains of the ear and
sides of the head are ameliorated by heat; earache ameliorated by
heat.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE-EAR</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There are pains in
the eyes. Inflammation of the eyes with bleeding. Oozing of a
bloody water from the eyes of the new born infant. Chamomilla will
cure if there is irritability of the temper. Profuse acrid
discharges; yellow discharges; discharges of purulent matter from
the eyes. Violent pressure in the orbit. Lachrymation accompanying
coryza with sneezing. Stuffing up of the nose. Headaches,
irritability. Associated with the above is a symptom: "Face red and
hot on one side, the other side pale." Like the whole constitution
of the remedy there is a great sensitiveness of hearing. Roaring,
ringing and singing in the ears. Stitching pains in the ears,
ameliorated by heat. Pressing earache. You will see the little one
when the pain comes on put its hands up to its ears, and spitefully
moaning, yelling and screaming. Violent pains in the ear. When old
enough to talk about it will complain of heat in the ear, and a
feeling of fullness as if the ear were obstructed or stuffed up. In
adults, nervous, sensitive women who cannot ride in the wind
without covering up their ears. The ears are so sensitive to air
when other parts of the face and head are not sensitive to air. You
will find some patients that can not have air touch the neck.
Others have extra covering between the shoulders. Chamomilla
singles out the ears. The whole body is sensitive to air and to
cold, and he wants to dress with plenty of covering.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Sneezing, watery
coryza. Hot face on one side, and often with pains in the head and
jaws. Fluent coryza, viscid, acrid, with loss of smell. Loss of
smell lasting while the cold lasts.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">FACE-
MOUTH-TEETH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Rending pains in the
face, sometimes involving the teeth and the outer face at the same
time. It is not an uncommon thing to have a very sensitive woman if
she is disturbed by chagrin, if she has been vexed by her servant,
to go to her room and suffer tortures from pain in the face from
that excitement, from anger. If it is the outer nerves in the face,
the pains will be ameliorated by heat; but when it affects the
teeth, the pains will be ameliorated by cold. Heat of the face,
while the rest of the body is cold. "The face sweats after eating
or drinking." It is a common feature of this remedy to sweat only
about the head, the hairy scalp. Sometimes during measles or
scarlet fever, we will have Chamomilla manifestations. Sweating
about the head, face red on one side. "One-sided swelling of the
check;" that is, an inflammatory attack, gets redder and redder,
and finally purple, going into erysipelas, with the mental
symptoms. Hot face, redness of one side. Burning in the face.
Neuralgia of the face. If anything warm is taken into the mouth it
will bring on aching in the teeth, and sometimes burning and
throbbing in the roots of the teeth; tearing, stitching, stinging
pains, aggravated by talking; aggravated in the open air;
aggravated in a warm room, or getting warm in bed, anything that
heats up the body will aggravate this toothache; ameliorated by
holding cold drinks in the mouth. Toothache that is entirely absent
in the daytime; as soon as it comes night, and the patient gets
into the warm bed, then these shooting, tearing pains begin; with
the irritability, over-sensitiveness to pain, the mental state, hot
head, you have the Chamomilla toothache. "Swelling and inflammation
of the gums. Threatened abscess of the gums. Toothache when coming
into a warm room," when it has been better in the cold air. This
toothache is one that may be brought on by taking cold, by exposing
one's self to cold air when sweating; and yet the toothache itself
when present is ameliorated by cold. "Toothache from a draft of
air." "Ameliorated from eating cold things. Worse before midnight."
The most of the troubles of Chamomilla that come on in the evening
and night subside about or sometimes before midnight. From midnight
to morning, almost all of the complaints of Chamomilla are absent.
Many of them are absent during the day. It has aggravation in the
FOREPART OF THE NIGHT. "Teeth feel too long. Swollen gums." The
Chamomilla infant will often hold a glass of cold water against the
gums. The little one has inflamed gums, painful gums, the coming
forth of the teeth is painful, and it seems to want to prolong the
cold in the mouth; when it is so young you would not think it would
realize the good of making use of the cold edge of the glass.
Offensive foetid smell from the mouth.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">THROAT</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The spasms that
affect the child all over are likely to affect the larynx, and
sometimes affect the larynx without affecting the child anywhere
else. "Spasms of the larynx during cough, or without cough.
Spasmodic constriction of the larynx. Choking. Spasms of the
throat. Sore and inflamed." Chamomilla cures sore throat when the
throat is of a uniform redness, spreading pretty evenly over the
whole throat, with considerable swelling. Inflammation of tonsils.
Much redness; when the mental state is present. It will never cure
a sore throat except in these irritable constitutions such as
suffer from pain, such as are easily angered, in a constant fret.
The Chamomilla mental state determines when you are to give
Chamomilla in sore throat.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOMACH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Want of appetite.
Great thirst for cold water and desire for acid drinks.
Unquenchable thirst." Aversion to coffee, warm drinks, to soups and
liquid foods. The aversion to coffee is a strange thing. Chamomilla
and coffee are very much alike in the general sensitivity of the
economy. They antidote each other. When persons have been
overdrinking coffee, nurses drinking coffee to keep up at night to
take care of the patient; persons overdrinking coffee when tired
and overworked, Chamomilla is its antidote. "Thirsty, and hot with
the pains." When the pains come, no matter where, she heats up, and
sometimes becomes really feverish. Face red, especially on one
side. Head hot; extreme irritability.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Chamomilla has much
vomiting. Eructations of gas which smells like sulphuretted
hydrogen. The Chamomilla patient has violent retching. Making
violent efforts to vomit. Seems that it will tear the stomach.
Covered with cold sweat. Exhausted. That is just what MORPHINE
does. If you have ever seen a patient who has been overdosed by a
doctor-I hope that you will never see one that has been overdosed
by yourself. Do not make a case, you will have one soon enough-but
if you get into a town where there is an allopathic physician, and
he happens to give MORPHINE to one of these oversensitive patients;
it may relieve her pain for a little while, but on will come the
awful eructations, and she will retch and vomit, and continue to
retch when there is nothing to vomit. Chamomilla will stop that,
the first dose, in a few minutes, and it is the only remedy you
will need. It will always stop the vomiting from MORPHINE after the
crude effect of MORPHINE has passed away and the vomiting
comes.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">ABDOMEN</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Colic, especially in
the little ones, in the infants. Pain in the stomach and abdomen.
The child doubles up, and screams, and kicks; wants to be carried;
is extremely irritable; attack comes on in the evening; one side of
the face red, the other side pale; wants things, and when they are
given does not want them; and you have a Chamomilla colic. It is a
wind colic. It lasts a fraction of a minute, and then it
straightens out again. It shows that it is a cramp, a wind cramp.
In adults, who have felt these symptoms, they are said to be
cutting, burning, griping. Griping pains. Of course, such are the
pains that are called colicky. Cramps in the bowels. Griping pains.
Sometimes griping as if must go to stool. The abdomen distended
like a drum. Sometimes ameliorated by warm applications. "Colic
while urinating;" that is an uncommon symptom. "Colic in the
morning. Tympanitic abdomen."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">RECTUM-STOOL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The most striking
Chamomilla stool is GRASS GREEN, or like chopped eggs, or like
these two chopped up; yellow and white, intermingled with mucus
that is grass green, like chopped grass; chopped spinach. Greenish,
slimy discharges, greenish water. Those old enough to express
themselves in the proving said that the stool felt hot while it
passed. It smells like sulphuretted hydrogen. Copious stool; scanty
stool, with dysenteric straining. Watery diarrhoea, six or eight
passages daily. Mucous diarrhoea. Green, watery stool, faeces and
mucus. "Yellowish brown stool." Also constipation, with no ability
to strain. A paralytic weakness of the rectum; inactivity of the
rectum. Much itching and rawness about the parts, especially in the
evening. Anus is "pouting," with swollen appearance and
redness.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-FEMALE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The woman, such as I
have described, oversensitive to pain, snappish, suffering
intensely from a little pain, takes on many symptoms at the
menstrual period. The menstrual flow is black, clotted, offensive.
Cramping pains in the uterus, clutching and griping, ameliorated by
heat. "Oversensitive to pain," with all the pains and complaints,
and the mental state, the irritability, the snappish mental state
at a menstrual period. Whether it be a menorrhagia, or a
metrorrhagia, there are copious black clots. "Menstrual colic
following anger," which means violent cramping pains in the uterus
during menstruation if she has had any great excitement to anger
her. Sexual irritability, emotions, disturbance of mind, will bring
on cramps at the menstrual period in a woman who is not subject to
cramps, affecting her as if she had taken cold. It is a very useful
remedy in membranous dysmenorrhoea. It, perhaps, has existed from
the first menstrual period. Every month the woman throws off a
little membranous formation. This is thrown off with violent
labor-like pains, and often with clots. Chamomilla may be a
palliative. It is not the constitutional remedy that clears away,
and prevents the future formation of this membrane, like the deeper
antipsorics, but it is often palliative in the more severe attacks,
with the irritable condition of the mind; feverish condition
ameliorated by heat; cramping, and clutching like labor pains.
"Yellow, smarting leucorrhoea. Excessive menstruation; blood dark,
nearly black, clotted, with pain through from back to front,
attacks of syncope, coldness of limbs, much thirst."</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In pregnancy, the
woman has also Chamomilla conditions. Irregular contractions; false
labor pains. Labor pains that are felt in wrong places. Labor pains
that are felt too much in the back. Contractions that are most
painful, cutting, tearing, bringing out screams. So irritable; she
scolds the pains; she scolds the doctor; she scolds everybody;
drives the doctor out of the room; drives the nurse off, and then
calls for her again; refuses things that are offered. Labor pains
that are clutching here, and clutching there, and cramping, showing
that certain fibres of the uterus are contracting in one direction,
and certain other fibres in another. There is not that uniform,
regular contraction that should take place in the expulsion of the
contents of the uterus; expulsion of a mole or expulsion of a
child. If the physician can have the pregnant woman under his care
during the period of gestation, he ought to be able to select
remedies to remove these irregular contractions of the uterus, or
to prevent them when it comes time for labor. The pains are then
not so violent. She feels the contractions, but in many instances
they are painless. You will not always be able to prepare women;
they will not always permit it. Women are more inclined to be
notional and whimsical and to have their own way a short time
before confinement than at any other time. A woman ought to be
under treatment all through gestation, and sometimes it takes
longer. Gestation is a fortuitous time for the woman to take
treatment. Symptoms representative of her disordered state come out
then that do not appear at any other time. If she has a psoric
condition it may remain dormant until pregnancy comes on, which may
act as an exciting cause to bring out the conditions that are in
the constitution. It furnishes, therefore, a good time for the
homeopathic physician to study the case and give that woman a
constitutional remedy based upon those symptoms that will not only
remove those symptoms and prepare her for confinement, but will
remove very much of the disorder in her economy, and she will go on
through life liberated from much distress, cured from many
conditions that perhaps would not have come out until some other
occasion brought them out. A woman that knows much about Homeopathy
would submit herself regularly to constitutional treatment during
gestation, that is, would be particular to give the physician
everything, all the details, all the sufferings, all the trouble,
that he may study that case, The things that are to be observed
during gestation are to be added to the constitutional symptoms
found when gestation is not present, because they are all evidence
of a disturbance in that one patient. And it is the PATIENT that is
to be treated, not a disease. It is simply another form of
disturbance, of disorder of the economy. The things that Chamomilla
reaches during confinement, and during its course, and at the close
of it, are irregular contractions, like hourglass contractions.
"Rigidity of the os." After confinement, after-pains. With all
these the same mental condition, the same oversensitiveness to
pain. "Postpartum haemorrhagia." Every time the child is put to the
breast, cramping of the uterus; cramp in the back. Either of these,
or both, Chamomilla cures. The two principal remedies you will have
to rely on for these conditions, cramping in the back and cramping
in the abdomen every time the child is put to the breast, are
Chamomilla and PULSATILLA. They are two decidedly different
remedies in the mental sphere. One is mild and gentle, though
whimsical; and the other is snappish and irritable. Both are
sensitive to pain, but Chamomilla is far more sensitive to pain
than PULSATILLA.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Chamomilla has
inflammation of the mammary glands. You cannot prescribe for that
unless you have something along with it, and I am sure you will
recognize a Chamomilla PATIENT. The woman goes into convulsions. At
the beginning of the confinement the husband comes into the room in
some snappish way, "to make his wife behave herself;" it makes her
mad, and she goes into convulsions. The doctor, perhaps, has just
turned his back upon it, but now he says, "Well, why did I not
think to give this woman a dose of Chamomilla? If I had done that I
would have prevented these convulsions." She becomes very
philosophical after a dose of Chamomilla, and often goes to
sleep.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">LARYNX AND
TRACHEA-COUGH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There are many
suffocative attacks and difficulties of breathing, inflammation of
the larynx, etc., that you can read up easily. The cough of
Chamomilla has some striking things in it. It is a hard cough, a
dry, hacking cough. The child goes to sleep at night and coughs and
does not wake up. Coughs in its sleep. It is a little feverish, has
taken cold, and one side of the face is flushed. It is crabbed when
it is awake. The child becomes angry when it has a cold and a
little cough, and a little disturbance of the larynx and bronchial
tubes has been noticed coming on, and all at once, it becomes more
excitable, wants to be carried, and if not pleased, or is angered,
it will go into a hard coughing spell, and cough and vomit.
"Coughing spells from anger." That is, he coughs when there is
already a cold or a cough, and if the patient becomes angry, he has
a fit of coughing. The coughing complaints, and chest complaints,
and laryngeal complaints are generally worse at night. The feverish
condition comes on at night with the Chamomilla colds, with the
Chamomilla whooping cough, with the Chamomilla chest complaints.
Most of the complaints of Chamomilla are better after midnight.
From 9 o'clock to midnight, they are worse. "Dry cough worse at
night and during sleep." Dry cough from catching cold. Rough,
scraping cough of children in winter, with tickling in suprasternal
fossa, worse at night. Dry cough, continuing during sleep.
Amelioration of cough when getting warm in bed. Chamomilla is a
very common remedy in whooping cough, where the child wants to be
carried; keeps the nurse busy all the time. Coughs and gags and
vomits, and it is very irritable and capricious in all of its wants
and coughs during sleep.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">CHEST</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">You can now easily
detect the chest symptoms. They go with the mental symptoms and the
irritability and cough. The cough in the chest is scarcely
different from the cough in the larynx and the cough from cold. It
is the same Chamomilla cough. COUGH DURING SLEEP. During most of
the complaints, fevers, colds, acute complaints and little attacks,
burning of the extremities. Stitching pains in the limbs. Cramping
in the muscles. Limbs go to sleep. With the pains in the limbs, and
sometimes in other parts, but particularly in the limbs, A BENUMBED
FEELING, or pains with the feeling of deadness, pains accompanied
by a benumbed feeling, sometimes almost complete loss of sensation
of the skin, yet the pains in the long nerves, in the extremities
are very violent, and the patient seems just as sensitive to pain
as at other times. Extremely sensitive to pain, but the pains
themselves cause a BENUMBING FEELING TO FOLLOW THEM. It has been
called in older books a paralyzing pain. Convulsions of the
extremities. Convulsions of the whole body. "Cramps in the legs and
calves. Tearing pains in the feet following a severe chill. Burning
of the soles at night; puts the feet out of bed." All the routine
prescribers whenever the patient is known to put the feet out of
bed give SULPHUR, yet there is a large list of remedies with hot
feet, burning soles, and all of them will put the feet out of bed,
of course, to cool them off. There is no reason why they should all
get SULPHUR.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">SLEEP</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Another feature of
the pains that come on at night, sometimes before midnight is, they
are so violent that he cannot keep still. When the child has pains
he wants to be carried, that seems to do him good. When the adult
has pains at night in bed he gets up and walks the floor. Benumbing
pains, pains ameliorated by heat, pains that drive him out of bed
at night, with twitchings of the limbs. Oversensitiveness to pain.
Great irritability. The Chamomilla patient can not go to sleep at
night. He is sleepy, like BELL., but he cannot sleep. If he quiets
down during the day, he wants to go to sleep. But as soon as the
time comes to go to bed he is wide awake, he is sleepless and
restless at night, especially the fore part. At times the
Chamomilla patient becomes so full of visions and so much excited
during the fore part of the night in his efforts to go to sleep
that when he does go to sleep he jerks and twitches and has horrid
dreams, and is full of sufferings. "Anxious dreams. Sees horrible
apparitions and starts: dreams about fatal accidents." Worn out
mentally from trying to go to sleep, and he is tired
out.</span></p>
