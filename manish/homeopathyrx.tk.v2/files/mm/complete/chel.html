<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">CHELIDONIUM
MAJUS</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Chel.)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Chelidonium is a
remedy more suitable for acute diseases, though it cures certain
chronic conditions. It is not a very deep acting remedy. It is
about like BRYONIA in its general plane, length and depth of
action. It has been used principally in gastric and intestinal
catarrhs, in acute and semi-chronic liver troubles, and in
right-sided pneumonia. The skin is likely to be sallow, and
gradually increases to a marked jaundice in connection with these
complaints. Semi-chronic gastritis, with jaundice. "Gastro-duodenal
catarrh. Congestion and soreness in the liver, with jaundice.
Right-sided pneumonia, complicated with liver troubles, or
jaundice." This remedy seems to act throughout the system, but
almost always along with it, the liver is involved, and it is
suitable for what the old people and the doctors called
"biliousness." The patient is generally bilious, has nausea and
vomiting. Distension of the veins. Yellowish grey color of the
skin.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Very few mental
symptoms have been brought out in its proving, not enough to give
us a good idea of the desires and aversions. We do not get a clear
idea of the intellectual faculties. It needs further proving, yet
in many regions it has had superabundance of proving. "Sadness and
anxiety." Brooding over some sort of trouble generally runs through
the mental state. "Anxiety, allowing no rest," keeping the patient
uneasy day and night. Sadness, as if she had committed a crime; as
if some dreadful thing was going to happen. So sad that she thinks
she must die. Weeping despondency. Distaste for mental exertion and
conversation. If you examine those medicines that act primarily
upon the liver, that slow down the action of the liver, you will
find the word "melancholia." With heart troubles, great excitement.
With liver troubles, slowing down of the mental state, inability of
the mind to work, sluggishness of the mind, inability to think,
inability to meditate, slow pulse. Sluggishness of the whole
economy. The sensorium is very commonly disturbed, and the patient
is dizzy. "Things go round in a circle." Dizziness comes, and it
does not let up until nausea, and sometimes vomiting, follows. "So
much turning in the head that he vomits. Confusion of mind. Loss of
consciousness and fainting." These are also common features with
liver troubles.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">ABDOMEN</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The mind symptoms
are present more or less with the following liver symptoms: There
are pains of a dull aching character, "soreness." Bruised pains.
Tenderness of the liver to touch. Aching pains, that seem to
involve the whole right lobe of the liver; creating a sensation of
fullness. Pressure upwards, with difficulty of breathing. Pressure
downwards, sympathetic with the stomach, with the nausea and
vomiting. And then more intense pain felt UNDER THE RIGHT SCAPULA.
"Dull aching pains under the right scapula; sharp, shooting pains
under the right scapula;" these complicate themselves again with
pneumonia, with pleurisy. It cures pneumonia and pleurisy; it cures
various forms of congestion in the liver, when these pains go from
before backward, and seem to be felt through the back. "Stitching
in the region of the liver, extending through to back. Hard pains
felt through the back." Some patients will describe these pains as
shooting pains; some as tearing pains, and others as sharp pains,
going through the right hypochondrium or through the right lobe of
the liver to the back. "Pains from the region of the liver,
shooting towards the back and shoulders. Spasmodic pain in the
region of the liver. Pressing pain in the region of the liver." In
congestion or inflammation, fullness and enlargement, semi-chronic
cases, or even acute, this medicine proves suitable for such
conditions. The right hypochondrium is tense and painful to
pressure.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This remedy has
cured gall stone colic. Practitioners, who know how to direct a
remedy, relieve gall stone colic in a few minutes. We have remedies
that act on the circular fibres of these little tubes, causing them
to relax and allow the stone to pass painlessly. In a perfect state
of health, of course, there are no stones in the bile that is held
in the gall bladder, but this little cystic duct opens its mouth
and a little gall stone engages in it, and it creates an irritation
by scratching along the mucous membrane of that little tube. When
this pain is a shooting, stabbing, tearing, lancinating pain,
extending through to the back, Chelidonium will cure it. The
instant it relieves the patient says: "Why, what a relief; the pain
has gone." The remedy has relieved that spasm, the little duct
opens up and the stone passes out through the ductus communis
choledochus. Every remedy that is indicated by the symptoms will
cure gall stone colic.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A patient lying in
bed, with great heat, extreme sensitiveness, cannot have the body
touched, screaming with pain, red face and hot head, will gall
stone colic, will be relieved in three minutes by BELL., but that
is not at all like this remedy NAT-SULPH. and many other remedies
have cured gall stone colic in a few minutes, when the symptoms
agreed.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">CHEST</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Now as to the
pneumonia, it is generally of the right side, or right-sided
spreading to the left. The right-sidedness is marked, and but small
portions of the left lung are involved. The pleura is generally
involved, and so there are stitching, tearing pains. One may not
practice long before he will find a Chelidonium patient, sitting up
in bed with high fever, bending forward upon his elbows, holding
himself perfectly still, for this medicine has as much aggravation
from motion as BRY. All of the pains are extremely aggravated from
motion. This patient is sitting with a pain that transfixes him; he
cannot stir, he cannot move without the pain shooting through him
like a knife. The next day you will see that his skin is growing
yellow. If you see him, in the beginning Chelidonium will relieve
him and you will prevent that pneumonia. It is not uncommon in
children, and it is extremely common in adults.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Do not get confused
with BRYONIA. Both are violently worse from motion. BRYONIA wants
to lie on the painful side, or wants to lie on the back if the
pneumonia is mostly in the posterior part of the right lung. In
Chelidonium he is worse from touch and motion.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">BELL. has that
extremely painful, tearing, rending of the right lung with
pleurisy, but in BELL., one cannot touch that right side, cannot
press it, but must lie on the other side and he cannot move. Cannot
stand a jar of the bed, because of the extreme sensitiveness to
motion. I mention all three in this particular way because they
have some things in common, but the remedies are
different.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Chelidonium has
cough with chest symptoms OF THE RIGHT SIDE, liver affections, and
the mental affections that commonly belong to these, violent
aggravation from motion. The pains are ameliorated by heat. Pain
that extends to the stomach, ameliorated by heat. Mental symptoms
ameliorated by eating. Craves hot milk; hot fluids. Eating warm
food ameliorates the liver, the chest and stomach
symptoms.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOMACH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Bilious vomiting.
Retching; bilious eructations. Nausea and retching during an attack
of anxiety." These are all commonly present during the complaints
described. The pains, when they become severe, seem to strike the
stomach and cause vomiting. Ameliorated by something hot. "A
feeling of anguish in the pit of the stomach. Persistent pain in
the stomach; aggravated by motion and ameliorated by eructations.
Constriction and sensitiveness in the pit of the stomach." These
are all aggravated by touch and ameliorated by eating. "Constant
aching pain in the stomach, ameliorated by food. Constrictive,
pinching pain in the stomach better from drawing up the limbs and
lying on the left side, ameliorated by eating."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It has many eye
symptoms. Stitching pains. "Opacity of the cornea." Inflammations.
"Bruised pain in the eyes. Right supraorbital neuralgia." In many
instances it prefers the right side.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the face, the
jaundice is the most marked thing that is expressed; and, then, we
have the dirty gray complexion. "Pale, dirty-yelow
face."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The headaches are
brought on from heat, unlike the stomach and the liver, and the
lungs, etc. The head is aggravated from motion, aggravated from
heat, aggravated from a warm room, aggravated from warm
applications. There is where it differs from the internal or
general state. There are numerous headaches. Periodical bilious
sick headaches, with vomiting of bile, brought on from exposure to
heat, from being overheated, aggravated from motion, wants to lie
perfectly quiet in a dark room, and better from vomiting bile.
Old-fashioned bilious sick headaches.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOOL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Bilious diarrhoea.
Along with jaundice, clay-like, pale, faecal, putty-like stool.
Bileless stool. Stool too light colored. Stool quite white in
children. Diarrhoea and constipation alternate. Stool brown, white,
watery, green mucus, thin, pasty, bright yellow, or gray tinged
with yellow.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">LARYNX AND
TRACHEA</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Hoarseness. "While
coughing, pain in the larynx, and pressure in the
larynx."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">COUGH</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The difficult
breathing comes on with liver symptoms and pneumonia and chest
troubles in general. "Difficult respiration, with short fits of
coughing. Short, quick breathing. Anxiety as if he must choke.
Difficult breathing; tightness over the chest as if breathing would
be hindered." It has also nightly attacks of humid asthma. This is
brought on from every change of the weather. All its complaints are
brought on from changes in the weather. He cannot stand weather
changes, either too cold or too warm. Rheumatic complaints in the
shoulders, hips and limbs, from changes in the weather.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">With complaints of
the liver, lungs and chest, there are coughs. They are spasmodic.
The chronic cough is violent, spasmodic, dry, coming in paroxysms.
"Spasmodic cough, without expectoration." After it has existed a
while there will be some expectoration. "Repeated attacks of short
cough. Short cough, with little grayish phlegm. Rattling, fatiguing
cough."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EXTREMITIES</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the limbs, there
are rheumatic and neuralgic pains. Neuralgia of the limbs in
general, most violent. Limbs feel heavy and stiff. Limbs flabby.
Later the patient runs down somewhat, weak heart, weak circulation;
dropsical conditions of the limbs. Great restlessness. "Trembling
and twitching of the limbs. Weariness. Indolence. Indisposition to
work."</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The neuralgias are
more common in the head and face than in the lower parts of the
body, in the limbs and in the extremities.</span></p>
