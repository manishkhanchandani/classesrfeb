<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">CHINA
OFFICINALIS</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Chin.)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Now we shall take up
the study of Cinchona, or China. Persons who have suffered much
from neuralgias due to malarial influences, who have become anaemic
and sickly from repeated haemorrhages, are likely to develop
symptoms calling for China. China produces a gradually increasing
anaemia, with great pallor and weakness. It is sometimes indicated
in plethoric individuals, but this is the exception, and even in
this class, we find that the symptoms are tending towards the
cachectic state, which is avoided by the prompt action of the
remedy.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Throughout the body
there is a gradually increasing sensitivity, a gradually increasing
irritability of the nerves; the nerves are always in a fret, so
that these people will say: "Doctor, what is the matter with me, I
am so nervous?" Everywhere there are twinning, tearing, cutting
pains-in the limbs and over the body. And so great is the
sensitiveness to touch that the nerves can many times be outlined;
as, for instance, the little nerves in the fingers, because of
their extreme sensitiveness. The China patient grows increasingly
sensitive to touch, to motion, to cold air, so that he is chilled
from exposure. The pains are brought on by exposure to the wind, by
cold air, and are increased by motion and touch. Old malarial
conditions that have been suppressed with quinine; gradually
increasing pallor, bloodlessness, cachexia, until the patient is
always catching cold, has liver troubles, bowel troubles,
disordered stomach, is made miserable and sick by nearly everything
he does. He cannot eat fruit without having indigestion; he cannot
eat sour things. He is debilitated, pale, waxy, suffers from pains,
such as are found in quinine subjects, and breaks out into a
perspiration upon the least exertion.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This patient bleeds
easily; bleeds from any orifice of the body-from the nose, from the
throat, from the uterus. And after haemorrhagia complaints come on.
Running through the remedy as a general constitutional state is a
tendency to congestion and often inflammation in connection with
haemorrhagia. Inflammation of the part that bleeds or of distant
parts. For instance, a woman aborts, has a haemorrhagia, but with
apparently no provocation, inflammation of the uterus or of the
lungs sets in. With these inflammations, there is also great
irritability of the tissues, tearing pains, cramping in the muscles
and actual convulsions. When a China patient bleeds a little, for
instance, in confinement, right in the midst of the bleeding
convulsions come on. You would scarcely need to think of any other
remedy. SECALE is the one other medicine that has this, but the two
do not look alike SECALE wants the covers all off and the windows
open, even in cold weather. If a draft of air blows on a China
patient, while in labor, she may go into convulsions. In the midst
of labor the pains cease and convulsions come on. Another feature
about this inflammation is its rapid progress and intensity,
quickly going into gangrene. Inflammation after haemorrhagia and
the parts rapidly turn black.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">China has a fullness
of the veins. Not exactly a varicose condition, but a sort of
paralysis of the coatings of the veins. The veins become full
during fever.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">All of these
complaints are such as we find in broken down constitutions, in
feeble, sensitive patients, especially in sensitive women.
Sensitive to the odors of flowers, of cooking, of tobacco. Weak,
relaxed, emaciated, pale, with feeble heart, feeble circulation and
tendency to dropsy. Dropsy runs through the remedy; anasarca and
also dropsy of shut sacs. A peculiar thing about this dropsy is
that it comes after haemorrhagia. In the anaemic condition,
directly following the loss of blood, dropsy appears. This is the
typical China patient.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Catarrhal condition
of all mucous membranes. Gastro-duodenal catarrh, ending in
jaundice. Old liver subjects with jaundice. They have lived for a
long time under the influence of the malarial miasm. Feeble,
sensitive, anaemic. We see such cases in the South and Southwest,
and along the Mississippi Valley.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Periodicity is
regarded as the most important indication for China, but it is a
mistake. Periodicity is the symptom upon which QUININE is given.
China has periodicity, but in no greater degree than many other
remedies and is not so frequently indicated as routine prescribers
suppose. Allopaths give QUININE whenever there is any periodicity
in complaints. Still periodicity is a strong feature in this
remedy. Pains come on with regularity at a given time each day.
Intermittent fevers appear with regularity and run a regular
course.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A part of this
periodicity is an aggravation at night, and sometimes sharply at
midnight. In colic that comes on regularly every night at 12
o'clock, and it may be, perhaps, a week before you suspect it to be
a China colic. A lady had colic and bloating of the abdomen every
night at 12 o'clock. After suffering many nights a single dose of
China prevented any further trouble. Haemorrhagia from the nose
coming on with regularity. Diarrhoea at night. Several gushing,
black, watery stools during the night; in the daytime, ONLY AFTER
EATING. There is a general aggravation after eating.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Remember, that this
is a chilly patient, sensitive to drafts, sensitive to cold, whose
complaints are brought on by being exposed to cold air; sensitive
to touch, sensitive to motion. Extreme irritability of the
tissues.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">China is indicated
in conditions following the loss of blood and other vital fluids;
as, for instance, in those who are suffering from sexual excesses,
from secret vice. They have become feeble, sleepless and irritable.
There is weakness and general coldness of the skin; twitching and
jerking of the limbs; drawing and cramping in the muscles; chronic
jerking; epileptiform convulsion; paralytic weakness; rush of blood
to the head; ringing in the ears; darkness before the eyes;
fainting on the slightest provocation. Such is the China cachexia,
and with this in view, the mental state will scarcely be a surprise
to you. It is just such as you would expect in this nervous,
sensitive patient. Weakness of mind. Inability to think or
remember. Full of fear at night. Fear of animals, dogs, of creeping
things. Wants to commit suicide, but lacks courage. Gradually the
mind grows weaker; he uses wrong expressions or misplaces words.
Lies awake at night making plans, theorizing, building air castles,
thinking of the wonderful things he is going to do some day. In the
morning, he wonders how he could have thought such foolish things.
After sleep his mind is clear and he looks more philosophically on
the affairs of life. Unable to entertain any mental proposition
that means work. He dreads work. He is apathetic, indifferent, low
spirited, silent, disinclined to think. He is unable to control the
mind, to make it do what he wants it to do. You see it is not as
yet a real insanity.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This state of mind
comes on after haemorrhagia. Insomnia after haemorrhagia. A woman,
after having suffered great loss of blood, will be sleepless night
after night.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">After haemorrhagia
we may have dizziness. It is a natural consequence; dizziness and
fainting. But ordinarily, after the proper diet for a few days,
these symptoms will have disappeared. With the China patient, they
go from bad to worse. The woman after severe haemorrhagia does not
make blood. There is mal-assimilation, and the vertigo persists for
days and weeks. China will restore order.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The remedy is full
of headaches. Congestive headaches in broken down constitutions.
Extremities cold and body covered with a cold sweat. Rending,
tearing pains. Pressing and throbbing. As soon as the air strikes
the head, those pains come on. Headache better in a warm room;
worse from touch; worse from motion; worse from cold. These are the
principal features. A slight touch will aggravate the disturbance.
But notice the exception. HARD PRESSURE ameliorates the China
pains, as light pressure aggravates. Sensitiveness of the tissues;
sensitiveness along the course of the nerves; the pains are brought
on by touch, by cold air. Stitches in the head with pulsation in
temples, which can be felt with the fingers; ameliorated by hard
pressure, but aggravated by touch. The jar and motion of walking
hurt the head. Even turning over in bed aggravates. Cannot ride in
a carriage or anything that jolts. Ameliorated by hard pressure.
Throbbing headaches aggravated by a draft of air, in the open air,
from the slightest touch; ameliorated by hard pressure. The scalp
feels as if the hair was grasped roughly. It is sensitive to touch.
Profuse sweating of the scalp. Headaches aggravated at night.
Headaches from sexual excesses; loss of vital fluids.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Now we come to the
eye. Photophobia. Yellowness of the sclera. Exposure to cold wind
will bring on neuralgia; ameliorated from keeping quiet and from
keeping warm. "Nocturnal blindness, dimness of vision. Feeling as
if sand were in the eyes. Pains worse from light. Better in the
dark."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EAR</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the ear and the
nose, you find the same sensitiveness as in eyes; every little
noise is painful. Ringing, roaring, buzzing, and singing, chirping
like crickets in the ears. Dry catarrh of the middle ear. Hardness
of hearing is not infrequently the result of this condition. It
gradually increases, until there is total deafness, and the noises
in the ear continue long after the patient has lost the ability to
distinguish articulate sounds. Haemorrhagia from the ear.
Offensive, bloody, purulent discharges.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Frequent nosebleed
in anaemic patients. Here, again, the dryness and catarrhal
conditions. Dry coryza; or fluent coryza, suppressed and causing
violent head pains. Odors nauseate. Sensitiveness to the odors of
flowers, cooking, tobacco.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">FACE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The face is
withered, shrunken, sallow, anaemic, sickly. Red when the fever is
on and sometimes when the chill is on, but in the apyrexia pale,
sickly and sallow. Neuralgia of the face; tearing, rending,
knife-like pains with the usual modalities. The veins of the face
are distended. This is frequently observed during the fever and
sweat of the China intermittents.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MOUTH-TEETH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The teeth get loose,
the gums swell. The teeth are painful while chewing; they feel too
long. Toothache with every little cold. Rending as if teeth were
being pulled out, every time the child nurses at the breast.
Exudations about the teeth and gums. Black, and foetid; great
putridity in the lower forms of fever.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The taste is
extremely acute. Exaggerated so that nothing tastes natural.
"Bitter taste in the mouth. Food tastes bitter or too salty.
Burning as from pepper on tip of the tongue. Dryness in the mouth
and throat. Difficult swallowing."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOMACH-ABDOMEN</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Sometimes there is
canine hunger, but one of the most common features is loathing of
everything; aversion to all food. The China patient is often
passive in regard to eating. Sits down to eat and the food tastes
fairly good and he fills up. But it does not matter much whether he
eats or not? "Loathing and violent hunger." "Hunger and yet want of
appetite. Indifference to eating and drinking. Only while eating
some appetite and natural taste for food return. Loss of appetite.
Aversion to all food. Aversion to bread." His appetite varies.
Thirst is peculiar. The patient will say: "I know my chill is
coming on now because I have thirst." Thirst before the chill, but
as soon as the chill comes on there is no thirst. But when he
begins to warm up he begins to get thirsty; that is, during the
period in which the two lap, he is thirsty, but when the chill has
fairly subsided and the heat is upon him his thirst subsides also
and he only wants to wet his mouth. But as the hot spell begins to
subside he increases the amount taken, and all through the sweat,
he can HARDLY GET WATER ENOUGH. Thirst before and after the chill
and thirst DURING THE SWEAT. No thirst during the chill. No thirst
during the hot spell. You will cure more cases of intermittent
fever with IP. and NUX VOMICA, than with China. China has
well-defined chill, fever and sweat.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Gastric symptoms
from eating fish, fruit, and from drinking wine. Flatulent
distension almost to bursting. There are constant eructations, loud
and strong, and yet no relief, so extensive is the flatulence. In
CARB-V. after belching a little, there is relief. LYCOPODIUM has
both. Tympanitic distension of the abdomen and stomach in low forms
of fever. Cannot move on account of soreness in the bowels.
Vomiting of blood. Sometimes followed by dropsy of the extremities.
"Hiccough. Nausea. Vomiting. Eructations, tasting of food, or they
are bitter, sour. Frequent vomiting. Vomiting of sour mucus, bile,
blood." Likely to occur at night. Pulsation in the stomach and
rumbling. Cold feeling in the stomach. Fermentation after eating
fruit. Acidity. Disorders of the stomach after milk.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOOL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Diarrhoea. Copious,
watery black discharges from the bowels. Gurgling and rumbling in
the abdomen. Stool immediately after eating and at night. Great
quantities of flatus expelled from the bowels. Diarrhoea comes on
gradually. Stools more and more watery. Chronic diarrhoea, with
emaciation and aggravation at night. PETROLEUM has a chronic
diarrhoea, but only in the daytime.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-FEMALE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Of the male genital
organs, the most striking feature is weakness. Of the female
genital organs, there is a different class of conditions. In the
woman who has been subject to uterine haemorrhages, you may look
out at any moment for a sudden, sharp attack of inflammation of the
ovaries. Haemorrhagia from the uterus. Prolapse. Menses too early
and too profuse; black, clotted blood; menstrual colic;
metrorrhagia. Pains and convulsions; convulsions come on in the
midst of the haemorrhagia; cramps in the uterus along with
haemorrhagia; labor-like pains; ringing in the ears; loss of sight;
sliding down in bed. In confinement the lochia is profuse and lasts
too long. Deterioration of health from prolonged lactation;
toothache; neuralgia of the face.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">RESPIRATION</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Difficult
respiration, rattling and filling up of the chest with mucus;
asthma. "Pressure in the chest, as from violent rush of blood;
violent palpitation, bloody sputa, sudden prostration." Dry,
suffocative cough at night; profuse night sweats. Pains in the
chest, increasing sensitiveness to cold, heat and redness of the
face with cold hands.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">BACK</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Along the spine
there are sore spots. Tearing, darting pains in the limbs,
ameliorated by heat and hard pressure, brought on by touch, by
becoming chilled. Worse at night. "Knees weak, especially when
walking."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">FEVER</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">China cures low
forms of fever, remittent or intermittent, typhoid or
malarial.</span></p>
