<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">CICUTA
VIROSA</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Cic.)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This remedy is of
interest because of its convulsive tendency. It puts the whole
nervous system in such a state of increased irritability that
pressure on a part causes convulsions. The convulsions extend from
center to circumference; the head, face and eyes are first
affected. An aura in the stomach gives warning of the convulsion.
Some complaints spread from the chest, especially from the heart;
the rigors and chills begin in the chest; and there is a sensation
of coldness about the heart, and from there it extends to other
parts. Convulsions often begin about the head and throat and extend
downward. The whole body is in such a state of tension that, after
excitement, a fire rages throughout the economy and causes
convulsions. Any irritation in the throat or oesophagus will cause
violent convulsions in this region. On swallowing a fish bone,
instead of only a pricking sensation as would occur in phlegmatic
individuals, the irritation is so great that a spasm commences and
spreads to other parts. It was the old remedy for tetanus and
spasms caused by splinters in the skin or under the nails,
competing with BELL. At the present day, we find the most
frequently indicated remedies for injuries to nerves are LED. and
HYPER.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A peculiar feature
about some of the symptoms is that they resemble catalepsy. The
cataleptic condition may be present or a condition very similar to
it. He recollects nothing that took place or that he said during a
certain period. He knows nobody, and lies without recognizing
anyone, but when asked questions he answers correctly, and
subsequently he has no recollection of what took place.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It is a
cerebro-spinal irritant; the head is drawn back, opisthotonos; all
the limbs are convulsed and rigid. It has cured traumatic tetanus
lockjaw, epilepsy, epileptiform convulsions.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">With severe pains in
the bowels come convulsive movements and convulsions. If the
stomach is disordered or chilled, or if he has fear or other mental
conditions, convulsions come on. He is extremely sensitive to
touch, and touch and drafts bring on convulsions. The convulsions
spread from above downwards, and thus it is the opposite of CUPR.
The convulsions of CUPR. spread from the extremities to the centre;
i.e., the little convulsions, merely cramps, are first felt in the
fingers and then in the hands and later in the chest and whole
body. In Cicuta the little convulsions of the head, eyes and throat
spread down the back to the extremities with violent contortions.
The convulsions of SECALE sometimes begin in the face.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">At times he knows no
one, but when touched and spoken to he answers correctly. Suddenly
consciousness returns and he remembers nothing of what has
occurred. He confuses the present with the past. He imagines
himself a young child. Everything is confused and strange. He does
not know where he is. The faces of old friends look strange; he
looks at them and wonders if they are the same persons he used to
know. His house and familiar places look strange. Voices sound
strange. The senses of sight and smell and all the other special
senses are disturbed and confused. He is confused as to himself,
his age and circumstances. A woman on coming out of the cataleptic
attacks often takes on childish behavior. A man thinks that he is a
child and acts like one; silly laughter, playing with toys, and
other acts of childish behavior. He feels as if he were in a
strange place, and this causes fear. Thinks of the future with
anxiety. Mental torpor; loss of ideas and sensation extending over
a certain period. Memory a blank for hours or days with or without
convulsions. Convulsions generally take the place of the ecstatic
or cataleptic condition. NAT-M. is somewhat similar to the mental
condition of this remedy, as the NAT-M. patient goes about doing
all her household work and other functions and next day knows
nothing about it. NUX-M. is another remedy that has such a complete
blank when going about doing things, a complete abstraction of
mind.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This patient has
strange desires; desires to eat coal and many other strange
articles, because he is unable to distinguish between things edible
and things unfit to be eaten; eats coal and raw potatoes. Wants to
be alone; dislike to society. Singing, shouting, dancing; likes
toys, jumps about like a child. Lies in bed lamenting and wailing.
Great agitation; child grasps at one's clothing in a frightened
manner. This is likely to occur before the convulsion, great horror
in the countenance, yet he has no recollection of the horror when
he comes out of the convulsion. That state of anxiety and fear
comes after the attack has begun, though the convulsions have not
yet come on. Between the convulsions the patient is mild, gentle,
placid and yielding, which distinguishes it from STRY. and NUX-V.
convulsions. The NUX-V. convulsions are all over the body and are
worse from touch and draft, blueness and purple color of the body,
but between the convulsions the patient is very irritable, Of
course, when they go out of one convulsion into another you cannot
see this, but when out of the convulsion the NUX-V. patient is very
irritable. The Cicuta patient, out of the convulsion, is full of
sadness, anxiety, and darkness, borrows trouble from the future, is
affected by sad stories, and is pessimistic. He is afraid of
society, afraid of company, and wants to be alone. He is suspicious
and shuns people; despises others; over-estimation of himself. In
this, it approximates PLAT., but there is no further resemblance
between the two remedies. Full of fear; fright will bring on
convulsions, like OPIUM, IGNATIA, and ACONITUM.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">VERTIGO-HEAD</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Full of vertigo. The
whole sensorium is violently excited. Things turn around in a
circle. Vertigo on walking, glassy eyes, etc. Complaints brought on
from injuries to the skull, from blows on the head. Many times
there is no trouble in the region of the injury; there may be
compression and yet all the pains be in distant parts; drawing of
the muscles and cramps. Concussion of the brain and chronic
injuries therefrom, especially spasms. Semi-lateral headaches
forcing the patient to sit still erect. Headache as if the brain
were loose on walking. When thinking of the exact nature of the
pain it ceased. It has cured cerebro-spinal meningitis when there
were convulsions and the convulsions were aggravated from touch,
with fever and even spotted mottled skin. Mind and head symptoms
after injuries. On going into a cerebro-spinal meningitis the
patient sits in a chair talking as if nothing were wrong, when,
quick as a flash, he passes into another state in which he knows no
one; he falls over limp, he is put to bed, and though he answers
questions he remains in a semi-conscious state, knowing no one.
This may change into a spasm. The head is bent back in spasms;
jerking back of the head; spasms begin in the head and go downward.
Violent shocks in the head, arms and legs. Head hot and extremities
cold, like BELL. in its convulsions. Sweat on the scalp when
sleeping. Child rolls head from side to side. Hot head.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Convulsive action
about the eyes; pupils dilated and insensible; patient lies fixed
in one place, with staring, fixed, glassy, upturned eyes, like
CUPR. Strabismus may be the only spasm the child is subject to from
cerebral irritation. Every time the child is frightened it has
strabismus; when touched or when it has cold, or after a fall
hitting the head, or coming periodically, it has
strabismus.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The nose is
sensitive to touch. Touch and jarring bring on complaints, and
hence it was so useful in, and was the first remedy for, the result
of injuries and irritability and over-sensibility.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">FACE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It has troubles from
shaving; it is useful in such eruptions as come in the whiskers;
barber's itch; a solid crop of eruptions all over the face wherever
the whiskers grow. Eruptions on the cheek like eczema. Swelling of
the submaxillary glands. Erysipelatous eruptions. It is closely
related to CON. about the lips and lids, in that a small amount of
pressure causes induration. It has cured epithelioma of the
lips.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">THROAT</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The throat troubles
are mostly spasmodic. After swallowing a fish bone or stick which
lodges in the throat a spasm comes on. After Cicuta the spasms will
cease and it can be taken out. It is useful in cases of injury,
accompanied with violent choking, so that he cannot allow an
examination to be made.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">CHEST</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Cold sensation in
the chest. Spasms of the chest. Feels as if the heart stopped
beating.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">BACK-EXTREMITIES</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Spasmodic symptoms
of the back. Opisthotonos. All conditions of the limbs are of a
spasmodic character.<br></span></p>
