<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">CINA</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Cina)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Cina is
pre-eminently a child's remedy, but it is suitable for conditions
in adults that are seldom thought of. A marked feature running
through is TOUCHINESS, mental and physical. The child wants
something, but does not know what. The child is aggravated by touch
and even by being looked at, and is worse from seeing strangers.
The skin is sensitive to touch. The scalp and back of the neck, the
shoulders and arms are so sensitive, that it is almost a soreness
as if bruised. The hyperaesthesia is both mental and physical. The
old routine of giving Cina for worms need not go into your notes,
for if you are guided by symptoms the patient will be cured and the
worms will go.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This patient is
disturbed by everything, worse after eating even a moderate meal.
The child takes a moderate supper and dreams all night, jerks and
twitches in sleep, rouses up in a fright, talks excitedly about
what he has dreamed, thinks it is real, and sees dogs, phantoms,
and frightful things he has dreamed about. The dream is prolonged
into the wakeful hours. Screams and trembles, with much anxiety on
waking; whines and complains. While this little patient is
aggravated by being handled yet he wants to be carried and kept
busy, like CHAMOMILLA; although not so intensely irritable as that
remedy, yet he must be carried. At first on taking him out of the
crib he screams when taken hold of; the first touch aggravates.
This aggravation from touch and sensitiveness runs through the
convulsions and fevers, with delirium, glassy eyes, drawn mouth and
white ring around the nose and mouth. With a disordered stomach, he
has convulsions after eating, with the head drawn back and glassy
eyes. The stomach is sour and the child is always spitting up sour
milk and belching sour wind. The child smells sour. The mother says
that ''Baby has a worm breath," but the same odor is present when
there are no worms. In the convulsions, there are loss of
consciousness and frothing at the mouth.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Hallucinations of
smell, sight and taste, in the delirious state, after taking cold,
or on waking from sleep; wakes up with the delusion. Things taste
and smell differently. The senses of taste and touch are
exaggerated or perverted.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In some cases of
internal hydrocephalus, not with enlarged skull, but with increase
of the fluid in the ventricles and central canal of the spinal
cord, the patients take on Cina symptoms. Rolling of the heed;
frequent headaches; sensitiveness to jar; cannot be touched or
tapped along the spinal cord without headache; always worse in the
sun; the head is hot and the feet are cold in the sun. Cina will
cure some of these cases. They cannot stand any kind of
disturbance; it produce; a convulsion. They cannot be punished
because they go into convulsions. If the ITER A TERTIO AD GUARTURN
VENTRICULUM is closed, they will be incurable, the internal
pressure will go on and they will die from it. Such congenital
states are incurable.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Dull headache with
sensitiveness of the eyes. Headache before and after epileptic
attacks and after intermittents. Before and during the headache
sensitiveness of the skull. Cina children cannot have the hair
combed, and the Cina woman must have her hair down in head and
nerve complaints.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There is coldness of
the extremities and also some itching of the skin, but the head
symptoms are predominant. From slight disturbances of the mind he
cannot digest, and he has diarrhoea. The complaints are aggravated
in summer; the heat affects the brain, arrests his functions, and
on comes diarrhoea with green, slimy stools or white stools, and
the child vomits. It is pre-eminently BRAIN in Cina; the orders are
not received from the brain and so stomach symptoms develop, and
worms hatch out. If he is cured, the healthy gastric juice will
chase the worms out.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The child turns his
head from side to side. The pains are sometimes better from turning
the head from side to side. You will see this in sensitive women,
who must have their hair down; ROLLING the head relieves, not
SHAKING as in the text, &nbsp;that is too violent.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE-VISION</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">All sorts of colors
before the eyes. Objects look yellow. It is useful in sensitive
women, sensitive nervous women, who are always worse from using the
eyes, and get pain in the head and eyes from sewing. It is like
RUTA in that respect, symptoms of eye-strain. It is not so much
indicated in young people but more when presbyopia is beginning in
middle-aged women, and there is the effort to strain the eyes on
fine work or print. Rubs the eyes and can then see more clearly. On
rising from the bed blackness before the eyes; different colors,
especially yellow. Strabismus when worms are present, depending
really on brain trouble because the worms are dependent upon
that.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE-MOUTH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Face sunken, pallid,
wings of nose drawn in. Blue ring or gray streak around the mouth.
"A sure sign of worms," the mother says. Child rubs its nose with
the hands or on the pillow or on the nurse's shoulder. Child bores
into the nose until the blood comes. The sickly aspect is striking,
but it is representative of brain trouble, central trouble. The
brain symptoms are the highest and most important. If frightened,
whipped, or scolded, the brain is disturbed and the stomach
disordered. They get indigestion and breed worms; white or blue
appearance about the mouth, grinding of the teeth during sleep.
Before the child has teeth, it has a chewing motion, a side to side
movement. Sensitiveness of the teeth to the cold air and cold
water. Bleeding from the mouth and nose. Inability to swallow
liquids; they gurgle down the oesophagus-before and after
convulsions. When the head symptoms are present, the milk or water
gurgles down the oesophagus with a gurgling cluck. This is present
in diarrhoea and vomiting with brain symptoms. ARS. and CUPR. are
also prominent in gurgling down the oesophagus when swallowing.
Choreic movements extend to the tongue.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOMACH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The child or adult
is not relieved by eating, is still hungry. The stomach is loaded
and yet he is hungry. After vomiting you would expect there would
be an aversion to food, but there is in Cina the same empty, hungry
feeling. When there is gnawing in the stomach after eating, or when
the child has taken all it can hold yet cries for the bottle, or
empties its stomach by spitting up and vomiting the food and then
reaches out whining and crying for more, think of Cina. Shuddering
when drinking wine as if it were vinegar.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">ABDOMEN-STOOL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Abdomen hard and
bloated. Very often the Cina child will flop over oh its belly and
get to sleep in that way. If it is turned on the side it wakes up
again. While in the mother's arms it will go to sleep with the
abdomen resting on the mother's shoulder, but when she puts it on
the side in bed it wakens. If you had a child with copious,
gushing, violently foetid stool, ameliorated by lying on the
abdomen, and it would have another stool if lying any other way,
PODOPH. would be the remedy. That would not be Cina. The Cina stool
is not very copious, and often white.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">COUGH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Gagging cough in the
morning. Short, hacking cough at night. Spasmodic cough. Whooping
cough.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">SLEEP</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Oversensitiveness to
touch; trembling, spasms, chorea. Spasmodic yawning. Child cannot
sleep unless on the belly or in constant motion.</span></p>
