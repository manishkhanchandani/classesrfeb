<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">COCCUS
CACTI</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Coc-c.)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There is a little
remedy and will be a relief after the study of so many difficult
ones. With fuller proving it will doubtless show itself a
deep-acting constitutional remedy. Although it has cured some
deep-seated chronic troubles, it has been used chiefly in acute
affections. This is only because of the scantiness of its provings
and our lack of knowledge concerning it in a general way. Very few
mental symptoms have been brought out. Its use, so far as
demonstrated, is mostly in catarrhal conditions of the air
passages, and whooping cough, with copious, ropy, jelly-like mucus.
Great quantities of this mucus form in the nose, in the throat, in
the air passages generally, and in the vagina. The routine
practitioner, whenever he sees thick, ropy, gelatinous mucus,
thinks only of KALI- BI. That comes from the study of key-notes.
But it must be remembered that other remedies besides KALI-BI. have
this.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Spasmodic cough;
whooping cough; the cough of drunkards. The chronic catarrhal state
of the Coccus cacti patient comes on especially in the winter. It
comes on when the cold weather begins and lasts until the warm
weather comes. The patient is cold, and his complaints come on in
cold weather. He is sensitive to cold, easily takes cold. But you
must distinguish between the patient himself and his complaints,
because they are entirely opposite to each other. When he once
becomes sick from exposure to cold, he is always worse in a warm
room and better in the cold air. His cough is brought on in a warm
room; from being too warm in bed; from drinking warm things. It is
better from drinking cold things in a cold room; worse from
exertion; from getting heated up; from becoming warm; that is,
after the complaint has once set in, it reverses itself.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This is not unlike
many other remedies. I have received many letters from doctors,
saying: "Why is it that in your repertory and in Boenninghausen's,
certain remedies are put down as better from cold and worse from
cold? They certainly cannot have both." But they do have both,
sometimes under different conditions and sometimes under the same
conditions. Sometimes these are primary, sometimes they are
secondary symptoms. A remedy must be examined to ascertain how it
is that these circumstances can be the very opposite of each other.
But commonly Boenninghausen registers both those things that belong
to particulars and those things that belong to generals, and if the
symptom, in his judgment, is strikingly worse by a certain
circumstance, even if it is the very opposite of the general, he
has that symptom in boldfaced type. PHOS. is a good illustration of
what we have been talking about. If you make a careful study of
PHOS. you will see that the complaints of the chest are all worse
from cold, from cold air and from being cold. He catches cold and
it settles in the chest, and the cough and irritation in the chest
are worse from cold and being exposed to cold air. But he wants
cold things in the stomach. His stomach feels better from cold
things. Let him have head trouble and his head is better from cold,
he wants cold things in his stomach. If he has stomach trouble, it
is made worse by anything hot; he wants cold water to drink, and as
soon as it gets warm, he vomits it up. You see PHOS. is worse from
cold and worse from heat. The pains in the extremities are better
from heat.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">COUGH-EXPECTORATION</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The chronic cough,
as has been said, is likely to begin with cold weather and last all
winter, with a copious formation of mucus in the chest. It is a
spasmodic cough, forcing the patient into the most violent efforts.
The face becomes purple. Finally, he retches and vomits long
strings of tough, ropy mucus, filling the mouth and throat and
causing him to choke. This is due to the fact that the mucus is so
tenacious that it cannot be ejected from the pharynx in the usual
way, therefore he must vomit. Now, there is a striking feature of
this remedy. Anything coming in contact with the pharynx, the
inside of the mouth, or even the gums, produces gagging and
retching and will bring on the cough. We find this in the chronic
states of sensitive persons, who are unable to brush the teeth or
rinse the mouth without gagging and sometimes vomiting.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There is a general
hyperaesthesia of the skin and mucous membranes. Sensitive to the
pressure of the clothing.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">With the chest
troubles there is much dyspnoea. He cannot walk without bringing on
difficult breathing. He cannot ascend a height without suffocation.
After the quantities of mucus are cleared out the cough is better
and he goes on for two, three or four hours, when another one of
these awful attacks comes on. They are apt to be worse at night
when he becomes warm in bed. If he can lie in a cool room without
much covering, he will go longer without coughing.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The whooping cough
is of a similar character. You will see the child lying in bed with
the covers off. It wants the room cold, and the mother will tell
you that if she can get to it quickly enough with a drink of cold
water she can ward off the paroxysm. The chest fills up with mucus
until respiration cannot be carried on any longer and it must be
cleared out, yet the child will resist and hold its breath to
prevent coughing. You will be astonished to see how speedily Coccus
cacti will change the character of that cough. One of the earliest
signs of improvement will be observed in the easier respiration.
The cough becomes less violent, the retching passes away, and in a
week or ten days, the cough will go, too. Cough worse after eating,
worse on waking, worse in a warm room.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the early stages
of whooping cough CARBO-V. will develop and bring out the symptoms
and furnish a good picture for a second prescription, even if it
does not cure.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE-THROAT</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Discharge of thick
yellow mucus from the nose; nose stopped up, with inclination to
sneeze. Great dryness of the nose. The air passages burn after the
mucus has been cleared away. The chest burns from the mere exhaling
of air. Sore throat with redness. Tickling in the throat. Sensation
of a hair or crumb lodged in the throat behind the larynx. Fauces
very sensitive. Arch of palate and fauces, as far as visible, very
red. Burning in the throat &lt; in the warmth, especially when
warmed up in bed, &lt; from warm drinks, though hot drinks are not
so bad. Better from cold drinks. If the patient gets warm in bed or
the, room gets warm he commences to clutch the larynx and cough.
The slightest touch on the palate or even the gums in examination
of the throat will cause gagging sometimes when the parts look
normal. He cannot hawk without gagging. On swallowing food
sometimes it will come right back again and cause gagging and
retching.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MOUTH-TEETH-STOMACH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Great thirst; wants
water often and in large quantities. Nauseous taste in the mouth;
never rid of it. Nausea in the throat. Vomiting of white, bitter
tasting froth. Toothache; sudden drawing pains in the teeth, worse
from cold and from touch.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The mental symptoms
are chiefly depression and anxiety. Great sadness; a cloud seems to
hang over everything. Apprehensiveness, especially at 2 to 4 a.m.
This state may alternate with loquacity and liveliness, like LACH.
There are other symptoms worse after sleep; wakes in the morning
with basilar headache, or with headache in the forehead; &lt;
mental exertion; after lying down; sometimes &gt; from slow motion;
&lt; on coughing and from exertion; &lt; after sleep.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">KIDNEYS</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A strong feature is
its action on the kidneys, resembling acute parenchymatous
nephritis. Albumen in the urine. Dark red sediment in the urine.
Pain shooting from the kidney to the bladder and down the legs;
&lt; from motion. Renal colic. Urging to urinate, but inability to
pass urine until a large clot of blood has been passed.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-FEMALE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In Coccus cacti the
right side of the heart is affected, the vessels become friable and
there is haemorrhagia, oozing of blood, forming great black clots.
The above symptom suggests a woman with uterine haemorrhagia. There
are haemorrhages of the uterus where the blood flows freely,
coagulates slowly and does not form much of any clot in the vagina.
But in this remedy the clots form very rapidly and the vagina
becomes packed, and the bladder cannot be emptied until the clot is
expelled. Uterine haemorrhage is a strong feature of this remedy.
Copious, frequent, prolonged menstrual flow. Large, hard, black
clots fill the uterus, are expelled by labor-like pains, and form
again. Inflammation of uterus and vagina, with copious, thick,
white, jelly-like, ropy mucus. Soreness of the vulva; cannot bear
the pressure of the clothing.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EXPECTORATION</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Haemoptysis, dark,
clotted; &lt; from exertion.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-MALE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the male, there
is impotence with dull pain in the loins. Dull pains in the region
of the kidneys, with albuminuria; heavy sediment in the urine,
etc., just such a state as you would find in a child that had taken
cold after scarlet fever.</span></p>
