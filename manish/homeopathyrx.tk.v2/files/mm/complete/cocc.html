<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">COCCULUS
INDICUS</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Cocc.)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">We will study the
general system and the mind as usual. Cocculus slows down all the
activities of the body and mind, producing a sort of paralytic
weakness. Behind time in all its actions. All the nervous
impressions are slow in reaching the centres. If you pinch this
patient on the great toe, he waits a minute and then says "oh,"
instead of doing it at once. In response to questions, he answers
slowly, after apparent meditation, but it is an effort to meditate.
And so with all nervous manifestations, thought, muscular activity,
etc. He cannot endure any muscular exertion, because he is weak; he
is tired. First, comes this slowness, then a sort of visible
paralytic condition, and then complete paralysis. This may be local
or general. There are certain causes which produce these effects. A
wife nursing her husband, a daughter nursing her father, becomes
worn out by the anxiety, worry and loss of sleep. She is exhausted;
unable to sustain any mental or physical effort; weak in the knees,
weak in the back, and when the time comes for her to sleep she
cannot sleep. Sickness brought about in this manner is analogous to
that caused by the Cocculus poison, and hence Cocculus from the
time of Hahnemann to the present time has been a remedy for
complaints from nursing, not exactly complaints that come on in the
professional nurse, for Cocculus needs the combination of vexation,
anxiety and prolonged loss of sleep, such as you have in the mother
or daughter who is nursing, or the nurse when she takes on the
anxiety felt by a member of the family; a wife nursing her husband
through typhoid, or other long spell of sickness. At the end of it
she is prostrated in body and mind, she cannot sleep; she has
congestive headaches, nausea, vomiting and vertigo. That shows how
a Cocculus case begins. One who is thus exhausted in body and mind
goes out for a ride. She gets sick headache, pain in the back,
dizziness, nausea and vomiting. She gets into the car to take a
journey. Sick headache comes on. She goes on a mile or two and will
have nausea, vomiting and sick headache. She feels weak all over,
feels as if she would sink away.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Cocculus patient
gets into a wagon to ride, sick headache, nausea, vertigo come on.
The Cocculus patient cannot endure motion. Aggravated by talking,
by motion, by the motion of the eyes, by riding. Wants plenty of
time to turn the head cautiously to see things. Wants plenty of
time to move, to think, to do everything. The whole economy is
slowed down, inactive.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Tremulous, tired,
excitable. The hands tremble when taking hold of anything, or he
takes hold of it awkwardly and drops it. Incoordination runs
through this remedy, and hence it has been used with good effect in
locomotor ataxia. It has staggering and numbness. Numbness is quite
a feature of this remedy. Numbness of the lower extremities, in the
fingers, in the shoulder, of the side of the face. Complaints from
anxiety.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Extreme irritability
of the nervous system. The least noise or jar is unbearable. You
have heard that BELL. is worse from a jar. So is Cocculus, and
quite like BELL. Cocculus is also like BELLADONNA in its
sleeplessness, and other general conditions. This sensation of
seasickness and dizziness is sometimes felt all over the body; a
sort of faint feeling which is followed sometimes by loss of
consciousness, or a paralytic rigidity. Stiffness of the joints is
a common feature in Cocculus. It belongs to the limbs in general.
But it is such a strong symptom I will mention it here. Limbs
straightened out and held there for a while are painful when
flexed. Persons who have been suffering from anxiety, prostrated,
will lie on the back, straighten out the limbs, and get up only
with great difficulty. The doctor comes and he discovers what is
the matter. He bends the limbs and she screams, but she is relieved
after the bending, and then she can get up and move about. You
cannot find that anywhere else. It is entirely without
inflammation. It is a sort of a paralytic stiffness, a paralysis of
the tired body and mind. The Cocculus headaches and backaches,
pains and distress are present. A man will stretch out his leg on a
chair and he cannot flex it until he reaches down with his hands to
assist. Such things are strange. Faintness on moving the body,
fainting from pain in the bowels, from colic. With all this slowing
down of the thoughts and activities the patient remains extremely
sensitive to suffering, sensitive to pain.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Spasms through the
body like electric shocks, convulsions after loss of sleep. This
patient goes on with nervousness and excitement, anxiety and loss
of sleep until convulsions supervene. Tetanus. Cholera, attacks of
paralytic weakness with pain, paralysis of the face, of the eyes,
paralysis of the muscles everywhere, paralysis of the limbs. Even
diphtheria has been known to induce a state very much like I have
described as due to loss of sleep and anxiety. I remember a case of
paralysis of the lower extremities that was prescribed for by a
very careful homeopathic physician many years ago. It was one of
the things that surprised me in the early days of my prescribing
and observation. It was the case of a little girl with paralysis of
lower extremities after diphtheria and no hope was given. But
Doctor Moore (he was then an Octogenarian) looked over the case. I
was acquainted with the family and with the doctor. He studied the
case carefully and gave Cocculus c.m. It was not many days before
the child began to move the legs, and the condition was perfectly
cleared up, and I have never ceased to wonder at it. It was a good
prescription, perfectly in accord with all the elements of the
case. Doctor Moore was one of the pupils of Lippe and
Herring.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">You can readily see
what is coming when the mental activities are slowed down, from
anxiety, and loss of sleep, such as we have in nursing. The mind
appears like approaching imbecility, and as you look upon the true
Cocculus case you wonder if that patient has hot been growing
insane for a year or two, because the mind seems almost a blank. He
looks into space and slowly turning the eyes toward the questioner
answers with difficulty. It occurs in nervous prostration, in
typhoid fever. It is so nearly like PHOSHORIC ACID that the two
remedies must be carefully individualized. Time passes quickly. He
cannot realize that it has been a whole night. A week has gone by,
and it seems but a moment, he is so dazed. Slowness of
comprehension; cannot find the right word to express his thoughts,
so slowly does his mind work; what has passed he cannot remember;
forgets what he has just read; cannot talk; cannot bear the least
noise; cannot bear the least contradiction. The tongue will not
respond. There is confusion of mind and difficulty of articulation.
An idea comes into his mind and becomes fixed. He cannot convert it
or move it, but it just stays there, and if he speaks, he will say
something that will cause you to realize that that same idea is
holding on to him. So he appears to be in a state of
imbecility.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">VERTIGO</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Mental derangement
with vertigo. With most all the mental symptoms, there is vertigo.
He lies in a state of apparent unconsciousness, yet knows all that
is going on and at times is even able to remember and describe what
was going on, but does not even wink; does not move a muscle. There
is an appearance of ecstasy, a smile upon the face. Knows what is
going on, yet with complete relaxation of the muscles without
speech or apparent recognition of anyone. Perfectly relaxed, and
yet knowing what is going on. That resembles catatonia. Unable to
think. Fears death. Feels as if some awful thing was about to
happen. All this is the result of grief, anxiety, vexation,
prolonged loss of sleep. The vertigo is usually attended with
nausea. A Cocculus case cannot look out of the car window, cannot
look down from the boat and see water moving, without nausea
immediately.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Perhaps you can even
now surmise what the head symptoms are to be. With the headaches
come dizziness, extreme nausea and gastric symptoms. Headaches
brought on from riding in a wagon or riding in the cars or on
shipboard; headache from motion. Cannot accommodate the eyes to
moving objects; dizziness and whirling and headache. Congestion of
the head, pressing, throbbing headache. Headache as if the skull
would burst, or like a great valve opening and shutting. Sick
headache with vertigo. Headache again from working in the sun. Sick
headache from riding in a carriage.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE-FACE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Dim sightedness and
disturbance of vision. Paralytic weakness of the muscles of the
eyes, as well as the muscles of accommodation. The face becomes
pale and sickly. Pale as death, with pains in the face, vertigo and
nausea. Tearing pains in the face. Neuralgia of the face. Face
bloated. Quivering and twitching of the muscles of the face.
Paralysis of the muscles of the face. Numbness of the face.
Twitching, jerking, numbness, paralysis, tearing pains.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Prostration and
nervous exhaustion accompany most of the complaints of
Cocculus.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MOUTH-STOMACH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Stomach symptoms.
Loathing of food. Metallic taste in the mouth. Bitter taste in the
mouth. Sour, nauseous taste in the mouth and no food tempts him. He
lies there sick with a little fever or a "cold." Headache, vertigo,
nausea, loathing. Intermittent fevers with pains in the limbs,
especially in the knees and bones of the legs, with that peculiar
stiffness, nausea, and loathing of food. In intermittent fever or
perhaps a low typhoid state, we have this loathing of food with
nausea. You go to the bedside and you ask the nurse, "What have you
been feeding the patient?" and the patient gags. The thought of
food makes the patient gag. The nurse will say that every time she
mentions food the patient gags. The thought of food or the smell of
food in the other room, or in the kitchen, will nauseate the
patient. Two medicines have this Cocculus and COLCHICUM.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">THROAT-STOMACH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Paralytic
conditions. Paralysis of the oesophagus. Cannot swallow. "Paralytic
condition of the throat after diphtheria." Sore throat with low
forms of fever. The fever is gone but the patient does not rally,
there is much nervous trembling, numbness, twitching of muscles and
great weakness. Sensation as though a worm were crawling in the
stomach. Spasms of the stomach. Violent attacks of gastralgia,
violent cramp of the stomach. Griping, pinching, constrictive
pain.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">ABDOMEN-RECTUM-STOOL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The pain in the
bowels feels as if the intestines were PINCHED BETWEEN SHARP
STONES. This causes fainting and vomiting. Colicky pains in the
bowels; great distension of the abdomen, such as is found in
typhoid fever; tension of the abdomen after drinking; flatulent

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-FEMALE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Copious menstrual

Again, just such a patient as described will have a suppression of
the menstrual flow, or for weeks and months will have no menstrual
flow; or just at the time the menstrual period should come on there
is a copius LEUCORRHOEA, THAT TAKES THE PLACE OF THE MENSES. The
woman is emaciated, and grows more and more sickly and chlorotic.
The face is of greenish, yellow, sallow hue. "Leucorrhoea in place
of the menses," or "copious leucorrhoea between the menstrual
periods."</span></p>

weakness, sometimes changeable; sometimes one side is numb and the
other paralyed. The soles of the feet go to sleep. Numbness of the
soles of the feet, such as we have in locomotor ataxia; cold feet.

<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Sleeplessness from
long nursing and from night watching; that is a symptom that I have
called your attention to so often. Anxious, frightful dreams; ill
