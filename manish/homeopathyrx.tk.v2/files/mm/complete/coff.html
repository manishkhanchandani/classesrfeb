<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">COFFEA
CRUDA</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Coff.)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This drug is
characterized by a general sensitivity. Sensitiveness of vision, of
hearing, of smell, of touch; sensitiveness to pain. It is most
astonishing sometimes about this great sensitiveness. PAINS ARE
INCREASED BY NOISE. Sensitiveness of hearing is so great that
sounds are painful. Pains in the face, toothache, headache; pains
in the lower limbs; everywhere aggravated by noise. All the nervous
disturbances possible are found in this medicine, and they are all
aggravated by noise. Even the opening of the door and the ringing
of the door-bell produces great suffering. Such patients are so
sensitive that they hear sounds which those in a state of health
cannot hear. Perhaps no medicine in the Materia Medica approximates
this sensitiveness of hearing where it is accompanied with pain,
unless it be NUX-V. Those practitioners who do not know this
generally resort to NUX-V. for pains aggravated from voices in
another room, or from noise or the sound of children. Many remedies
have increase of nervousness from noise; noise aggravates headache,
and aggravates suffering about the head, and makes some persons
nervous. But pain in the extremities aggravated by noise is
peculiar. It seems that the noise disturbs him so that he cannot
bear pain.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Coffea state is
brought on by emotions or violent excitement of the mind, but
especially by joy or "pleasant surprise." The result is
sleeplessness, nervous excitement, neuralgia, twitching of muscles,
toothache, faceache, red face and hot head.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">You may be called to
the bedside of a woman who has been laboring for some great cause.
She works persistently, is successful, but goes to bed with
weeping, delirium, neuralgia, sleeplessness. Her heart palpitates,
her pulse flickers, she has fainting spells, and without Coffea she
may die. Coffee drinkers who keep up through some ordeal and then
break down are similarly affected.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Coffea patient
is sensitive to wine. A small amount of wine intensifies the
nervousness, produces sleeplessness, flushed face, feverishness,
great excitement. Not necessarily intoxication, but nervous
excitement. Coffea has a painful sensitiveness of the skin beyond
comprehension. I remember one particular case. A woman had her
lower limb out of bed and it was as red as fire down one side. I
walked toward it to put my hand on it. But she said, "Oh, don't
touch it, I can't bear to have it touched; I can't touch it
myself." I asked how long this had been coming on. She said, "Oh,
it all came on within an hour." Such a symptom is common in coffee
drinkers. There was no fever. Intense stinging, burning pains in
the skin with the redness and heat with coarse rash coming on
suddenly, leaving just as suddenly. The sensitive part is
aggravated by cold air, aggravated by any wind or from fanning,
from motion, yet aggravated by warmth. Aggravated from anyone
walking across the floor. The woman I referred to scowled when I
was walking toward the bed. A number of times I have seen such
things relieved within a few minutes by Coffea.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Fainting from sudden
emotions. Hysteria, nervousness, weeping. Pitiful weeping from
pain; trembling and weeping from hurt feelings; the slightest
neglect. The greatest mental and physical exhaustion; great
restlessness; lying awake most of the night. The wakefulness
produced by Coffea is well known, even to the laity. It is taken by
nurses to keep them awake nights with their patients. The Coffea
patient is quick to act and to think. So full of ideas that she
lies awake nights making plans, thinking of a thousand things;
utterly unable to banish the thoughts that flood the mind; hears
the clocks on the distant steeples, as do OPIUM, CHINA and NUX-V.
Hears the dogs barking. So great is the brain activity, the mental
excitement, that she hears noises that are purely imaginary. Memory
active, easy comprehension; full of ideas; increased power to think
and to debate. Coffea increases the mental capacity. But after a
while, reaction follows; she becomes stupid and sleepy. There is no
end to the fancies, to the visions. Fanciful visions come before
the mind. Recalls things not thought of for years; recalls poetry
that was recited in childhood. Eyes brilliant; pupils dilated; face
flushed; head hot.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MOUTH-TEETH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">With all these
nervous states, the patient dreads the fresh air. He is extremely
sensitive to cold, sensitive to the wind and cold weather.
Complaints come on in the cold weather, from the cold air. Pain in
the mouth and jaws, BETTER FROM HOLDING ICE-COLD WATER IN THE
MOUTH. This applies to toothache and faceache where it is deep in
the jaws. Hot head; inflamed condition of the gums. Pain in the
teeth; rending, tearing pain in the teeth, brought on from exposure
to cold, from emotions, from excitement, from joy; aggravated from
motion; ameliorated by ice or ice-cold things; aggravated by warm
food. Cannot drink warm tea, it so intensifies the pain. That is a
particular. The particulars contrast with the generals. In one
place you may see "better from cold" in black-faced type, but it
relates to the face and jaws. Worse from cold is a general.
Aversion to cold air, aversion to the open air unless it is very
warm and still. Aversion to wind. "Neuralgic toothache entirely
relieved by holding cold water in the mouth, returning as it
becomes warm. Toothache during the menstrual period. Complaints of
anaemic children during dentition." Those nervous, excitable
children that talk to the nurse and the mother very rapidly with
brilliant eyes, red face, cannot go to sleep. It will quiet the
patient and actually favor the growth of the tooth in a painless
manner. That is the description of a nervous child with many
nervous brain and mental troubles. This child is extremely
sensitive; it takes cold. The routine prescriber gives BELLADONNA
to a child who has hot head, hot face and throbbing carotids, and
when it does not help, he gives more BELLADONNA, and increases the
size of his dose until the child has a proving. He makes a
BELLADONNA child out of it when Coffea would have cured it. In most
instances where BELLADONNA is indicated the child is sluggish and
stupid, and would like to sleep. With Coffea there is excitement.
The child hears things its mother cannot hear; sees things;
imagines things. Wakes up in fright. Sees this, that and the other
thing in the room. Wakes up excited as if it had visions. Looks for
things, and finally sees they are not there. Such things are strong
features of Coffea.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD-EAR</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">At times the head is
hot, the face is flushed and the eyes so brilliant that one fears
apoplexy. Patients will often tell you that they hear a "noise" in
the head, a ringing and roaring in the occiput. The ear is the one
organ capable of registering sounds. But strange to say, the ears
are sometimes very deceiving. Roaring in the ears sometimes seems
as if it were in the occiput. Sometimes it is accompanied with a
sensation of tingling or bubbling in the head. When patients say,
"I have a roaring in the head," you know that means in the ear;
many times accompanying roaring, ringing in the ears, buzzing in
the ears, is a peculiar sensation of vibration in the head that is
mistaken by the patient for a sound. I mention that because the
Coffea patient feels a crackling or a bubbling in the occiput. The
head feels badly; it feels too small. Headache, as of something
pressing hard upon the surface of the brain. You would naturally
suppose there was a pressing because of the congestive state
heretofore described. "Headache as if the whole brain were torn and
bruised, or dashed to pieces. Worse from motion, noise or light."
The eye and the head symptoms are worse from noise and light.
"Headache intolerable. Head feels small, and as if filled with
fluid. Nervous hysterical headache. One-sided headache." There is
another head symptom which is quite common. A feeling as if a nail
were driven into the head. Coffea headaches are worse from walking,
from motion; from the mere moving across the floor, he says he
feels a draft of air on his head. And that is true of the pain in
any part of the body. If a Coffea patient should have a pain in the
hand, swinging of the hand through the air will aggravate. It is
worse both from the motion and from the air. I want to illustrate
that in this way in order to show how sensitive he is to air, and
especially the painful part to cold air; when he moves against the
air, against even still air he feels it. But the amelioration of
the toothache from cold is an exception, is a
particular.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">FACE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The neuralgia of the
face is a common feature of old coffee drinkers. Sensitive persons
take coffee and finally become habituated to it. They say they
cannot get along without it. They must have coffee. Such
individuals should stop coffee. When coffee furnishes a crutch it
is a sure indication that drinking it must be stopped. So it is
with tea or any beverage. Such persons sometimes become sensitive
to coffee, and they drink it in great quantities; the face becomes
red; headaches come on, and other symptoms of Coffea. Stopping
coffee brings out quite a proving, and you have to study CHAM. and
NUX-V. for an antidote. In all these remedies, you get opposite
effects. Now OPIUM will illustrate that. The first effect of OPIUM
is to constipate. Let several doses be given, and as the effects of
the OPIUM wear off, he may have diarrhoea. OPIUM eaters can seldom
stop because a diarrhoea comes on. If you should ever have an OPIUM
case and diarrhoea comes on PULS. will nearly always control it.
But there are individuals who reverse that. Often small doses of
OPIUM will bring on dysentery, and if it is increased, bloody
dysentery and inflammation of the bowels come on. Of course, one is
action and the other the reaction.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-FEMALE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A woman who is a
confirmed coffee drinker will have menses too soon and lasting too
long. Uterine haemorrhagia is not uncommon. Another feature of
Coffea is that the woman can scarcely wear the napkin during
menstruation (PLATINA). The parts are in a state of hyperaesthesia.
The vagina is hot and sensitive, often preventing coition. In the
text it reads "Great sensitiveness of female genital organs, with
general excitability. She is in a state of ecstasy. Uterine
haemorrhagia with excessive sensitiveness of organs and voluptuous
itching, Metrorrhagia; large black lumps." Sometimes large bright
red lumps. "Worse from every motion, with violent pain in the
groins, and fear of death." Excessive sensitiveness about the vulva
with voluptuous itching is a strong feature of Coffea, and you will
often find such symptoms in coffee drinkers.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">During and after
labor we also see this great excitement, all these nervous
manifestations. The nervous system is in a fret, and such a mental
state as described comes on with after-pains; extremely sensitive
to pain, cries out; sees visions; hears all sorts of noises. Pains
aggravated from motion; aggravated from noise. Wants everybody to
keep still in the house.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">CHEST</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Convulsions of
children. "Puerperal convulsions. Extreme excitability."
"Palpitation of the heart, pulse fluttering." "Strong, quick
palpitation of the heart with extreme nervousness, sleeplessness
and cerebral erethism caused by unexpected news of great good
fortune." Let a woman about to go into confinement hear suddenly
some unusually good news and she becomes almost ecstatic; carries
the symptom all through confinement. The child is affected, the
milk is affected. The milk flows away. Haemorrhagia is likely to
