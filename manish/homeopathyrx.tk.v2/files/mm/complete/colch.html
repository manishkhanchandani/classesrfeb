<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">COLCHICUM
AUTUMNALE</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Colch.)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It is rather
singular that traditional medicine used Colchicum so much for gout.
In all the old books, it was recommended for this malady. The
provings corroborate the fact that Colchicum fits into many
conditions of gout. Acute rheumatism and uric acid diathesis;
rheumatic complaints in general, with swelling and without
swelling. But traditional medicine does not tell us what kind of
gout to give it in or what kind of rheumatism. It was really the
medicine of experience. "If it is gout, try Colchicum." The
question of what was to be done with the PATIENT when the remedy
failed never came up. It was "Give the prescription and keep at
it," and drugs were administered until the patient, steadily
growing worse, passed from one doctor's hands to another's. It is
true that Colchicum fits into the gouty state. Spells of cold, wet
weather will slack up the flow of urine, make it scanty, or
decrease the quantity of solids in the urine. This takes place in
the provings of Colchicum and has been verified many times. It is
well known that such a condition will bring about or intensify the
gouty state. If the solids in the urine are deficient, if they are
not carried off in the urine, something must happen, and the gouty
state comes on.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Colchicum is
aggravated by cold, damp weather; by the cold rains in the fall. It
is aggravated by anything that will debilitate. It is aggravated in
the extreme heat of summer; it has a summer rheumatism; the heat
will slack up the flow of urine or the quantity of solids in the
urine.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A striking feature
running through the remedy is its tendency to move from one joint
to another, from one side to another, from below upwards, or from
above downwards. Rheumatic conditions with swelling or without
swelling; first here, next there, changing about from place to
place. Another striking feature is the general dropsical condition.
When the hands and feet swell, and there is pitting on pressure.
Dropsy of the abdominal cavity; of the pericardium; of the pleurae
and dropsy of serous sacs. Swellings that are inflammatory and
rheumatic; swellings that are dropsical, with pale urine. Whether
copious or scanty, still it is pale.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Muscular rheumatism
and rheumatism of the white fibrous tissues of the joints.
Rheumatic troubles that have been going on for some time will end
in cardiac troubles. When cardiac troubles with valvular defects
are present, almost the first thing the busy doctor thinks of is a
history of rheumatism. Let me say that a part of the study of
Materia Medica consists in the observation of sick people. A busy
physician learns without books, though of course he should
familiarize himself with the literature, so that from reading, as
well as observation, he may acquire a knowledge of the general
nature of sickness. When he listens to the patient's story or makes
a physical examination, he knows how such cases usually conduct
themselves. He knows what to expect. He knows the natural trend of
sickness and instantly recognizes what is strange and unusual. He
will not recognize what is strange and unusual unless he knows what
is natural. So your books on symptomatology and pathology,
diagnosis, etc., will tell you much of this, but as you gain
experience in homeopathic practice you will get a much finer idea
of this because your Materia Medica teaches you to observe more
closely. The Materia Medica man learns to single out and trace
every little thing in order to individualize. So it may be said
that years of observation in studying disease, studying the sick
man along with the Materia Medica, will open to the mind a much
grander knowledge of the sicknesses of humanity than can be had by
practicing traditional medicine. Traditional medicine benumbs the
ability to observe.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">All the complaints
of this remedy are aggravated from motion. The painful complaints,
the head complaints, the bowel complaints, the liver complaints,
the stomach complaints, are all worse from motion. Such an
aggravation from motion that he dreads to move. About as marked as
we find in BRYONIA. Aversion to motion, and aggravation from
motion. Aggravation from becoming cold and in cold, damp weather.
He is a chilly patient, sensitive to cold. Most rheumatic patients
are sensitive to cold, but there are a few exceptions. There is no
greater rheumatic patient than the LEDUM patient. He presents both
sides. Though he is cold, his pains are ameliorated by cold. In
Colchicum the pains are ameliorated by heat, by wrapping up, by
being warm. If he moves, any suffering that he may have will be
intensified. Great prostration accompanies the complaints of this
remedy. Weakness of the limbs, great exhaustion, nervous exhaustion
of a typhoid character. He gradually grows weaker like one going
into Bright's disease. He has grown weak for some time, and he is
pallid and waxy. His hands and feet pit upon pressure. Examine the
urine and you will find albumen in it. The urine becomes black like
ink with albumen. There is an unusual degree of irritability of the
tissues, soreness, sensitiveness to touch, sensitiveness to motion;
bruised feeling of the joints and of the whole body. Touch and
motion bring on a painful sensation in the body as of electric
vibrations. Great weakness and exhaustion. He cannot exert himself
in the least without causing dyspnoea. Must lie down; does not want
to move; sinking of strength; seems as if his life will flow out of
him from motion and from exertion; so tired and exhausted. This
naturally occurs when going towards Bright's disease, when going
towards a continued fever. Kidney affections and liver affections.
Lassitude, prostration, anxiety. The muscles twitch and electric
shocks pass through the body. A paralytic weakness was observed in
the poisonous effects and too prolonged provings. The jaw hangs
down, the muscles are flabby, relaxed. He lies on the back as if
sinking; slides down in bed like one in typhoid, in low forms of
rheumatic and in continued fevers, so great is the exhaustion.
Paralysis of the limbs or of one limb, or of any part.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Colchicum
patient is almost constantly sweating, even with fever, and
sometimes the sweat is cold. A draft blows upon him, suppresses
that sweat and the paralytic condition of the limbs comes on;
suppression of urine and retention of urine. This describes the
profound character and type of sickness. Low forms of sickness;
prostrating sickness; sickness with nervous trembling; with great
exhaustion. After acute disease has passed away, great weakness and
dropsy follows. Dropsy after scarlet fever.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND-HEAD</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">With all these
troubles, the stomach and the bowel symptoms are very decided. This
is like COCCULUS. Absolutely unable to touch food. Nausea, gagging,
retching at the bare mention of food in his presence. The thought
and smell of food bring on nausea and vomiting. With all these low
forms of disease, these states described, we can see that this kind
of weakness is little different from the COCCULUS weakness.
Colchicum has delirium, prostration, depression of mind, great
sensitiveness to pain, which he seems to feel in his mind, and it
brings out mental symptoms. Very sensitive to pain; confusion of
the mind; disorders of comprehension. Cannot understand what he
reads. The headaches are all of a rheumatic character. Very often
the whole skull, the pericranium, is sore as if bruised. The scalp
is sensitive. Pressure in the head-constriction; pressing, bursting
headaches. Heat in the head. Tearing in the scalp. Headaches are
all aggravated by motion.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The eye symptoms are
of a rheumatic character, are connected with rheumatism, rheumatic
fever. It is not very uncommon to have iritis in connection with
rheumatic fever and it is a strong feature of Colchicum. Ulcers of
the lids, styes, much lachrymation in the open air. The tears
excoriate and cause redness of the lids.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">He takes cold
easily. Sneezing, stuffing up of the nostrils. Nosebleed in
rheumatic and gouty constitutions. But there is one feature that is
more marked in Colchicum than all others. He is so sensitive to
odors that he smells things which others do not smell. He smells
odors from which he is nauseated. "Strong odors make him quite
beside himself." You say "soup" or "broth," or something to eat,
and he gets sick. He can smell the things in the kitchen, in spite
of much precaution, and this runs through the remedy. In typhoid
fever, prostrated beyond the usual-and typhoid is always prostrated
enough-he is unusually prostrated. He cannot take milk, cannot take
raw eggs, cannot take soup, because he gags at the mere thought of
them. He has gone on for days, and his family are afraid that he is
going to starve to death. That aggravation from odors is so strong
with him that it seems to take possession of him. It involves his
appetite, his weakness, his stomach. So it does, seem that it is a
strong feature. Notice that this is one of his loves; it is a
perverted love, and the loves are general whether they are
manifested through the eyes, nose or touch. It enters into his very
life because it involves hatred to odor, and when it stands out in
low forms of disease like the continued fevers, the exhaustive
fevers and rheumatic complaints it becomes a general. It would be a
particular if it were something that applied to the things alone,
but you see it enters into the very innermost. Involves a hatred,
becomes mental, becomes a part of the man. He himself may be said
to hate odors, hate the smell of food and the thought of it. Do not
say "food" in the presence of a Colchicum patient, but give him
Colchicum first, and pretty soon he will want something to eat. It
removes that hatred for food. What a vital thing it must be when a
man hates that which will keep him alive.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">TEETH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The teeth are very
sensitive. "Rheumatic teeth." The gums settle away; after a while,
the teeth become loose. Pain in the teeth; rheumatic condition of
the jaws and the teeth. "Grinding of the teeth, teeth sensitive
when pressed together."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOMACH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Aversion to food;
loathing the sight and smell," more the smell of it. "The smell of
fish, eggs, fat meats or broths causes nausea even unto faintness."
The Colchicum patient may have much thirst or no thirst, or these
may alternate. Nausea and vomiting are very strong features.
"Nausea and inclination to vomit, caused by swallowing saliva.
Nausea, eructations and copious vomiting of mucus and bile. Violent
retching followed by copious and forcible vomiting of food, and
then of bile."</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the stomach there
is sometimes coldness and sometimes burning. Now it may be that the
Colchicum patient has both coldness and burning. They are both
recorded in the Repertory and in the provings, but it is sometimes
difficult to tell which is which, more difficult than you will
imagine unless you try a piece of ice somewhere and something very
hot. "Burning in the pit of the stomach." Coldness in the
stomach.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">ABDOMEN</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Now the abdomen
furnishes us still more to observe. The abdomen is distended with
flatus, tympanitic. Great soreness in the whole abdomen. Just such
a tympanitic condition as we have in typhoid. If you ever happen to
be in the country practicing medicine, and the farmer's cows get
into a fresh clover patch and eat themselves full and become
distended so that you are afraid they are going to explode offer
your services and give each one of those cows a few pellets of
Colchicum. It will be but a few minutes before the wind will get
out of there to your surprise and the farmer's, too; and you may
convert him to Homeopathy. Farmers have been known to put a butcher
knife into the pouch of the cow between the last short ribs to let
the wind out. The cow will get well, but Colchicum is better than
the butcher's knife. The same is true of the horse; in fact, of man
or beast. When the abdomen is violently distended and tympanitic,
Colchicum is often a suitable remedy.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">RECTUM-STOOL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Spasmodic pains,
colic, tearing pains, burning, griping pains, forcing the patient
to bend double. Aggravated from motion. Great tenderness and
soreness with the colic. Aggravated from eating; ameliorated from
bending double. And then comes the diarrhoea. It has just such a
diarrhoea as is found in low forms of fever. Dysenteric or
diarrhoeic stools that are jelly like. They form in the pan a solid
mass of jelly like, coagulated mucus. Very painful, extremely
painful is the Colchicum stool. Great soreness in the abdomen.
Great relaxation of the parts. Protrusion of the rectum. Putrid,
dark, bloody mucus. "Bloody discharges from the bowels with deathly
nausea." Fall dysentery, with discharges of white mucus and violent
tenesmus. Putrid, dark, clotted blood and mucus pass from the
bowels. Diarrhoea with violent, colicky pains. Bloody stools with
scrapings, from the intestines and protrusion of anus. Profuse,
watery stools in hot, damp weather or in the autumn. Watery,
jelly-like mucus passes from anus with violent spasm in sphincter.
It passes as a thin, watery flow; but as soon as it cools, it forms
a jelly.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">BLADDER-KIDNEYS-URINE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The urine burns when
it passes. It is attended with much pain. Inflammation of the
kidneys, inflammation of the bladder; tenesmus; retention of urine.
The kidneys manufacture no urine; scanty urine with dropsy. The
urine is inky, that is, very dark brown and sometimes almost black,
loaded with albumen. This remedy conforms principally to the acute
form of Bright's disease.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">RESPIRATION-CHEST</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Great dyspnoea,
rapid, short breathing; the heart's impulse strong. Respiration
accelerated. The heart's impulse can be heard all over the room.
Palpitation; oppression of the chest. Feels as if he had a great
weight on the chest; cannot breathe. Hydrothorax; the pleural
cavities distended with serum, causing the dyspnoea. "Heart's
action muffled, indistinct, very weak." Stinging, tearing pains in
the muscles of the chest.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EXTREMITIES</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Paralytic pains in
the arms; enlarged finger joints. This also tells what a low form
of sickness, what a feeble circulation the medicine brings about.
"Weakness so that he strikes the knees together when walking; pain
all over as if bruised. Swelling of the joints." The joints are
most affected. Muscular rheumatism. Numbness, oedema, swelling of
the limbs.</span></p>
