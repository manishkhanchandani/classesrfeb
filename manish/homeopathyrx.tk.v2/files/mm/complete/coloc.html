<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">COLOCYNTHIS</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Coloc.)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The principal
feature of Colocynth is its severe, tearing, neuralgic pains; so
severe that the patient is unable to keep still. Sometimes they are
&gt; by motion-at least it appears that they are worse during rest-
&gt; by pressure and sometimes &gt; by heat. Pains occur in the
face, abdomen, along the course of the nerves.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">These pains are
often due to a very singular cause, namely, anger with indignation.
Hence, persons who are haughty and easily offended or chagrined
have Colocynth complaints. Anger will be followed by violent
neuralgia in the head, eyes, down the spine and in the
intestines.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In spite of extreme
restlessness, there is great weakness with the pains. A patient
suffering with chronic diarrhoea, with severe colic, will sometimes
become so weak that he can hardly speak. A feeling of faintness, or
even fainting, is by no means an unusual concomitant of the pains.
Griping occurs along the course of nerves, and in some cases
numbness, pricking and tingling, like the crawling of ants in the
part affected.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">With many doctors
Coloc. is a routine remedy for sciatica; and only when it fails to
do they take the symptoms of the case in order to find the remedy
that is indicated. There is no excuse for such practice. Where the
pain is better from hard pressure and from heat, where it is worse
during repose and drives the patient to despair, Coloc. will
generally cure. But it is not indicated in all cases. Some remedies
select the muscles and tendons, some the bones and periosteum,
while others select the great nerve trunks in which to manifest
their symptoms. The pains of Coloc. appear, as a rule, in the
larger nerves.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The mental symptoms
are not very striking. As soon as the prover of Colocynth begins to
have pains along the course of nerves he becomes irritable;
everything vexes him; he is worse from vexation.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Screams with the
pains. Walks about the room and becomes increasingly anxious as the
pain goes on. Disinclined to talk or to answer, or to see
friends.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">His friends irritate
him and he wants to be alone.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">He has all he can do
to stand those terrible pains.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Vomiting and
diarrhoea frequently come with the pains, especially if they are in
the abdomen.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Colic comes on in
paroxysms that grow in intensity.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The patient becomes
increasingly nauseated until finally he vomits and he continues to
retch after the stomach is empty.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Colocynth produces a
state in the nervous system like that found in individuals who have
for years been laboring under annoyances and vexations. A man whose
business affairs have been going wrong becomes irritable and
nervous exhaustion follows. A woman who must watch her unfaithful
husband night and day to keep him away from other women gradually
assumes a sensitive irritable state of mind, and is upset by the
least provocation. This is the state of the Colocynth
prover.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">You will seldom find
this medicine indicated in strong, vigorous, healthy people who
have suddenly become sick. It is more likely to be in the
constitution just described, and those who are in the habit of
overeating.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD<br>
<br></span><span class="cs5EFED22F">We find tearing pains in the
scalp, brought on by anger; exhaustion; pains that are better from
pressure and heat, and worse when not in motion. Constant, gnawing
pains in the head. Painful, tearing, digging through the whole
brain, becoming unbearable when moving the eyelids. Intense pain
through the whole head; worse from moving the eyes. Severe,
pressing, tearing headache, causing her to cry out. Intermittent
headache in those of a rheumatic, gouty or nervous diathesis. Pain
tearing and screwing together. Violent periodical or intermittent
headache.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Such are some of the
expressions in the text. But the particular character of the pain
is not as important as the circumstances that are likely to cause
it and the conditions in which the patient has been living. Knowing
the life of a patient affords much knowledge of the patient
himself.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE<br>
<br></span><span class="cs5EFED22F">The same violent neuralgic
pains are found in the eye. Rheumatic iritis, worse in the evening
and night. Severe, burning, cutting and sticking pains in the eye.
Burning is more characteristic of the pains of the eyes than of
other parts of the head and face. Sharp, cutting stabs; pressing
pains.<br></span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C"><br>
FACE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The faceache is
especially important, because Coloc. is one of the most frequently
indicated remedies for neuralgia of this region. There are three
remedies which are indicated in faceache more often than any
others, BELLADONNA, MAGNESIA PHOSPHORICA and Colocynth.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The BELLADONNA pains
are as violent as any, and are accompanied by red face, flashing
eyes, hot head, and great sensitiveness of the part to
touch.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In Coloc. the pains
come in waves, are better from heat, from pressure, worse if
anything during rest, and are brought on by excitement or vexation.
They are generally on the left side; while those of BELLADONNA are
on the right, and are caused by cold.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">MAGNESIA PHOSPHORICA
has tearing and pains that shoot like lightning along the nerves
and are relieved by heat and pressure.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The expression of
the Colocynth face is one of anxiety from the severity of the
suffering. No matter where the pain is, the face is distorted.
Finally, it becomes pale and the cheeks become blue.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Tearing pains in the
cheek-bones, or more correctly, in the infraorbital nerve where it
emerges from the foramen. Sometimes this pain feels like a hot
wire, sometimes like a cold nail, and sometimes it is tearing,
burning or stinging. Frequently it spreads over the face, following
the ramifications of the small branches of the nerve, usually on
the left side. The patient cries out and is very
restless.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Tearing or burning
pain extending to the ear and head.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">All pains are better
from pressure, but this is in the beginning. After the pain has
been going for several days with increasing severity, the part
becomes very sensitive and pressure cannot be endured.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOMACH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Aversion to food.
Violent thirst.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Colic brought on
from drinking while overheated; from eating indigestible things,
from high living; colic from eating potatoes.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Potatoes and starchy
foods disagree with the Coloc. patient like ALUMINA.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The vomiting of
Colocynth is different from that of most other remedies. Nausea
does not appear at first, but when the pain becomes sufficiently
intense nausea and vomiting begin, the contents of the stomach are
ejected, and the patient continues to retch until the severity of
the suffering decreases.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The stomach pains
are clutching, cramping and digging, as if grasped by the
fingers.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">ABDOMEN</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Similar pains occur
lower down in the abdomen, but they are still better from hard
pressure, and from doubling up-which amounts to pressure-come on in
paroxysms of increasing severity, until the patient is nauseated
and vomits, and are associated with great restlessness and faint,
sinking feeling at the pit of the stomach. The victim bends down
over the back of a chair, or over the foot-board if unable to get
out of bed.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the guiding
symptoms, we find several pages of repetitions, showing how
extensively this medicine is applicable in abdominal complaints
where these symptoms are present. It would be well to read
them.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The pains in the
lower part of the abdomen are relieved by drawing up the limbs and
pressing with the fists. In the violent ovarian neuralgias of
Colocynth, the woman will flex the limb of the painful side hard
against the abdomen and hold it there.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The physician asks:
"What has happened to give you these pains?" Her answer is likely
to be: "My servant spilled some dirty water on a handsome rug, we
had some words over it, and this is the result."</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Colic from anger
with indignation; better from bending double and worse in the
upright position, while standing or bending backwards.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Colic of infants
when they are relieved by lying on the stomach; as soon as the
position is changed they begin to scream again.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">RECTUM-STOOL</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The same symptoms
accompany the diarrhoea and dysentery. The stools consist of white
mucus, are thick, ropy and jelly-like; at times bloody. At first
they may be copious, strong smelling, pappy, and later watery,
yellow, scanty and almost inodorous.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Diarrhoea and
dysentery from anger with indignation; the most awful tenesmus
during stool; urging to stool with colic.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Eating ever so
little brings on the colic, urging and stool.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Watery stools after
eating.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Many of these cases
