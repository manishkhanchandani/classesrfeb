<p class="csC583D0C8"><span><span class="csB86C8CFE">CONIUM
MACULATUM</span></span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Con.)</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This medicine is a
deep, long acting antipsoric, establishing a state of disorder in
the economy that is so far reaching and so long lasting that it
disturbs almost all the tissues of the body. The complaints are
brought on from taking cold, and the glands become affected all
over the body. Prom every little cold the glands become hard and
sore. Infiltration in deep-seated diseases in the region of ulcers
and in the region of inflamed parts; in the glands along the course
of the lymphatics, so we get a chain like knots. The glands under
the arm inflame and ulcerate. The glands in the neck, in the groin
and abdomen become enlarged. Ulcerated parts indurate. An abscess
of the breast becomes surrounded by lumps and nodules. Nodules in
the breast even where milk has not yet formed; lumps and nodules,
indurations and enlarged glands form under the skin all over the
body. Con. has been used extensively for malignant affections of
glands, because it takes hold of glands from the beginning and
infiltrates, and they gradually grow to a stony hardness, like
scirrhus. Now, another grand feature running through this remedy is
the action upon the nerves. The nerves are in a state of great
debility. Trembling, jerking of the muscles and twitching from the
weakness of the nerves. Inability to stand any physical effort
without great exhaustion. Gradually growing paralytic weakness,
somewhat as was described in COCCULUS. Exhaustion of body and mind,
that is, a general slowing down of all the activities of the body.
The liver becomes indurated, sluggish, enlarged. The bladder is
weak, can expel only a part of the urine. Or sometimes there is a
paralytic condition and no expulsive power. This shows that the
remedy increases toward a paralytic weakness.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Hysteria.
Hypochondriacal state of mind, with the nervousness, trembling and
weakness of the muscles. He gets tired in the earlier stages, but
finally this goes on until the limbs are paralytic.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A great many of the
complaints are painless. The ulcers and the paralytic conditions
are painless. Great physical and mental debility; great prostration
of the muscular system; exhaustion, tremulous weakness. Paralysis
of the legs and hip. Mental symptoms, nervous symptoms, trembling,
in widows and widowers who have suddenly been deprived of their
sexual relations. When in a state of considerable vigor, if
suddenly deprived, the woman or the man takes on a state of
trembling weakness, inability to stand any mental effort, and
inability to put the attention upon things said by others. Not so
marked or not so common in the woman as in the man. When this state
comes on in a woman who is of unusual sexual vigor there may be
severe congestion of the uterus and ovaries, APIS is more likely to
fit her symptoms man Conium. But with hysteria and excitability,
Con. is often the remedy. Many of its symptoms come about from such
a cause.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Conium has such a
deep action that it gradually brings about a state of imbecility.
The mind gives out. The mind at first becomes tired like the
muscles of the body. Unable to sustain any mental effort. The
memory is weak. The mind will not concentrate, it will not force
itself to attention; it cannot meditate, and then comes imbecility.
Inability to stand any mental effort or to rivet the attention upon
anything are some of the most important symptoms in this medicine.
Insanity of a periodical type. Imbecility, though, is far more
frequent than insanity. When you come to examine the mental states,
you will see symptoms that will make you think the patient is
delirious, but that is not quite it. It is a slow-forming weakness
of mind; not that rapid, active state, such as accompanies a fever;
it is a delirium without a fever, so to speak, which is not
constant. Forms of insanity that is passive. He thinks slowly, and
he continues in this stage for weeks and months, if he recovers at
all. Those excitable cases that have more or less violence and
activity in mental states are such as will correspond to BELL.,
HYOS., STRAM. and ARS. You see nothing of that in this medicine.
This state of tile mind has come on so gradually that the family
has not observed it. The mind is full of strange things that have
come little by little, and when the family look over the many
things that he has done and said they begin to wonder if he is not
becoming insane, but he is travelling toward a state of imbecility.
Conium is of a slow, passive character. Complete indifference;
takes no interest in anything, particularly when walking in the
open air. "He is averse to being near people and to talking of
those passing him; is inclined to seize hold of and abuse them."
That, of course, is an insane act. "Sad and gloomy. Great
unhappiness of mind, recurring every fourteen days," showing a two
weeks' periodicity. The Conium patient will sit and mope in the
corner in a state of sadness and depression, giving no reason only
that he is so sad. A hypochondriacal subject going around with
whims and notions that people attempt to reason him out of and the
more they attempt to reason with him the more sad he is. Morose,
peevish, vexed. Everything vexes and disturbs him. Cannot endure
any kind of excitement, it brings on physical and mental distress,
brings on weakness and sadness. Sometimes Conium symptoms will be
found in persons who have suffered from grief; they become broken
in memory. This is likely to come first. They forget, never can
recall things just as they want them. And so they grow weaker and
weaker until they become imbeciles. If it is decidedly mental,
imbecility results; if it is taking a physical course the ending is
paralysis, and it is not uncommon for a general paralytic weakness
to come on, so that body and mind progress toward weakness together
until some decided manifestation is made, and then it will be seen
to be going toward paralysis, or some decided manifestation is made
which will send it toward imbecility, and then the body will seem
to remain stationary. There comes a time in these cases where there
is a sort of division between the body and the mind. Whenever under
homeopathic treatment, the physical improves and the mental grows
worse, that patient will never be cured. There are such cases. I
never like to see the physical grow better and the mental grow
worse in any degree. That does not mean the aggravation caused by
the remedy. If the mental does not improve, it means that the
patient is growing worse. There is no better evidence of the good
action of a remedy than mental improvement.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">VERTIGO-HEAD</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Conium patients
cannot endure even the slightest alcoholic drink. Any wine or
stimulating beverage will bring on trembling, excitement, weakness
of mind and prostration. There are many headaches in these
patients. Patients going into decline will manifest headaches.
Stitching, tearing pains in the head; throbbing in the head. Signs
precursory to a giving out of the brain. Neuralgia.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Weakness of muscles.
Weakness of muscles on one side of the face. Paralysis of the upper
lids. Tingling pains. These are only in keeping with the signs of a
general breakdown. We would not think of giving Conium for those
sudden, violent congestions of the brain, or sudden, violent
attacks of pain in the head, face or eyes, but those that accompany
a general progressive disease. There are stitching, lancinating,
knife-like pains along the course of nerves about face and eyes and
head. Stitching in the top of the head. Burning on top of the head.
Often the symptoms will lead the homeopathic physician to make a
physical examination. A great deal more important than the physical
examination are the symptoms that point out a remedy.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Excitement will
bring on headaches. Numbness of the scalp is one of the common
symptoms of Conium. It is a general; wherever there is trouble
there will be numbness, numbness with pains, very often numbness
with the weakness. Paralytic conditions are attended with numbness.
Sick headache with inability to urinate. Great giddiness.
Everything in the room seems to go around. Confused feeling in the
head. Often sits lost in thought. Vertigo and pressure in the head
with unaltered pulse. Vertigo worse from stooping. The slightest
spiritous drink intoxicates him. Vertigo when turning the head,
like turning in a circle, when rising from a seat; worse when lying
down, AS THOUGH THE BED WERE TURNING IN A CIRCLE; WHEN TURNING IN
BED or when looking around. The vertigo most common in Conium is
that which comes on while LYING IN BED ROLLING THE EYES or TURNING
THE EYES. This is somewhat as it is in COCCULUS, not as to vertigo
alone, but the general slowed down condition of the
muscles.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE-VISION</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The paresis or
weakness of the muscles all over the body is also present in the
eyes. There is a muscular weakness of all the muscles of the eye,
so that the Conium patient is unable to watch moving objects
without getting sick headaches, visual and mental disturbances.
Riding on the cars, watching things in rapid motion, and inability
to focus rapidly-slowness of the accommodation is what we must call
it-is the cause for many sicknesses. Inability to follow moving
objects with sufficient rapidity and a headache comes on. "Objects
look red, rainbow-colored, striped; confused spots; double vision;
weakness of sight. Shortsighted; cannot read long without letters
running together." All this is due to defective accommodation.
"Sluggish adaptation of the eye to varied range of vision. Vision
becomes blurred when he is irritable. Weakness and dazzling of the
eyes, together with dizziness. AVERSION TO LIGHT WITHOUT
INFLAMMATION OF THE EYES." The pupil will not accommodate itself to
the changes between strong light and dim light, and he suffers from
it. Severe photophobia and lachrymation. Photophobia without
congestion of any tissue without or within the globe of the eye.
Sometimes the pupils are contracted and sometimes dilated. Conium
has cured ulcer of the cornea. "Burning in the eyes when reading."
Shooting, smarting, cutting, burning pain in the eyes. The lids
indurate, thicken and are heavy and fall. It is with difficulty
that he can lift them up. So this paralysis extends all through the
muscles of the body and affects the mind similarly. "Could scarcely
raise the eyelids, they seemed pressed down by a heavy weight.
Burning on entire surface of lids; hordeola; paralysis of muscles
of the eyes."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">FACE</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A marked condition
is that of swelling of the glands about the face, ear and under the
jaws. The parotids are swollen and hard. The same gradually
increasing hardness in the sub-maxillary and sub-lingual glands.
Enlargement of the glands of the side of the neck in cancerous
affections. It has cured epithelioma of the lid, and of the nose
and of the cheek. Ulcers about the lip with induration. Deep under
the ulcer, there will be hardness, and along all the vessels that
send lymph towards that ulcer there will be a chain of knots.<br>
<br></span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">THROAT</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Paresis extending to
paralysis of the oesophagus; difficulty in swallowing; food goes
down part way and stops. As food is about to pass the cardiac
orifice it stops and enters with a great effort. "Strange rising in
the throat, with sense of stuffing, as if something were lodged
there. Sense of fullness in the throat as of a lump, with
involuntary attempts at swallowing. Fullness in throat with
suppressed eructations. Pressure in oesophagus as if a round body
were ascending from stomach." That is a nervous affection found in
nervous women and has been called globus hystericus. When a woman
feels as if she wanted to cry, and she swallows and chokes, she
will have a similar lump in the throat. Nervous, broken-down
constitutions; tired of life; sees nothing in the future but
sickness and sorrow and paralysis or imbecility. When they have
their lucid moments, they weep, become sad over their enlarged
glands and weakness, and have a lump in the throat.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOMACH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There are many
stomach troubles; ulceration of the stomach; cancer of the stomach.
Conium is one of the greatest palliatives in symptoms of the
stomach when all the symptoms agree. It will palliate cancerous
conditions for a while, and then on comes the difficulty again,
because when the symptoms have advanced sufficiently to indicate
Conium many times there is no hope of cure.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">ABDOMEN-RECTUM-STOOL-URINE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Hardness of the
abdomen, great sensitiveness of the abdomen. Pinching pains,
stitching pains, colicky, cutting pains, cramping pains. Bearing
down in the abdomen-in the woman-as if the uterus would escape.
Often more common than diarrhoea is constipation with ineffectual
urging, hard stool, paralysis of the rectum. Inability to strain at
stool, inability to expel contents because of the paralytic
weakness of all the muscles that take part in expulsion. Pulsation
and emptiness in the abdomen after a normal stool. The woman
strains so much at stool that the uterus protrudes from the vagina.
After every stool tremulous weakness and palpitation. The urine
will stop and start. He strains to expel the urine and gets tired
and stops. The stream of urine stops and without any pressure
whatever it starts again, and it does that two or three times
during urination. Irregular muscular actions while passing urine.
"Intermittent flow of urine, with cutting after micturition. Urine
turbid after standing."</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-MALE-BLADDER-PROSTATE GLAND</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Weakness of the
sexual powers of the male; impotency. He may have most violent
sexual desire yet he is impotent. "Great sexual desire with partial
or complete incapacity. Emissions without dreams. Painful emissions
and painful ejaculations." There is a catarrhal state of the
seminal vesicles attended with much soreness, so that when
ejaculation takes place there is cutting like a knife, as if the
semen were acrid. Bad effects from suppressed sexual desire in
widowers and those who have been accustomed to coition. "Sexual
weakness. Insufficient erection, lasting only a short time;
weakness after embrace. Swelling and induration of testicles."
Hardness and swelling of the testicles gradually comes on.
"Discharge of prostatic fluid on every change of emotion, without
voluptuous thoughts, or while expelling faeces; with itching of the
prepuce." Hence, we have a strange intermingling of increased
irritability of the parts, the neck of the bladder, sexual organs,
prostate gland, with weakness, with impotency. In the male,
remember, there is induration and enlargement of the testicles; in
the woman induration and enlargement of the ovaries and
uterus.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-FEMALE</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Uterine spasms
during too early and scanty menses." Soreness in the abdomen in the
early stages of gestation, motions of the child are painful.
Burning, stinging, tearing pains in the neck of the uterus. Great
soreness of the breasts. This medicine has dwindling of the mammary
glands as well as enlargement and induration. Suppressed
menstruation, painful menstruation, throbbing, tearing, burning
pains in the uterus and in the ovaries, in the pelvis. It has cured
fibroid tumors of the uterus. It has restrained cancerous growth of
the cervix. One of the most distressing growths known to women is a
cancerous growth of the cervix. It is the most difficult to check
of all the cancerous affections known. It will progress most
rapidly, but Conium is one of those remedies that will slow down
that inflammation and restrain somewhat the haemorrhages. Conium
has produced induration and infiltration of the cervix.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">RESPIRATION-COUGH</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Difficult breathing.
Dry cough almost constantly, worse lying in bed. Cough when first
lying down. Is obliged to sit up and cough it out. Taking a deep
breath causes cough. Such are the striking features of a Conium
cough.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">CHEST</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the chest,
violent stitches. Painful swelling of the breasts. Rending, tearing
pains in the chest.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">BACK-EXTREMITIES</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the back,
weakness is a most striking thing, with some dorsal pains.
Lancinating pains are spoken of. "Ill effects of bruises and shocks
to the spine." After injuries, especially in the lumbar region,
pains and filling up of the veins of the lower limbs. Rheumatic
pains; paralysis of the lower limbs; ulceration. And the sufferings
and conditions are BETTER BY LETTING THE LIMBS HANG DOWN. Conium
differs from a great many medicines. It is common for pains and
aches to be relieved by putting the feet up on a chair; by putting
them up in bed. But the patient with the rheumatism, with the
ulceration of the legs and the other strange sufferings of the
legs, will lie down and permit his legs to hang over the bed up as
far as the knee. That is something that somebody ought to undertake
to account for, so we could have at least one thing we could
prescribe for under pathology. But up to date we have no
explanation. Tottering gait in middle-aged men.</span></p>
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs243F98C">SLEEP-PERSPIRATION</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Another grand
feature of the remedy; he sweats copiously during sleep. Sometimes
the patient will say that if he merely closes the eyes he will
sweat. It is certainly true on closing the eyes preparatory to
going to sleep he will break out in a sweat.</span></p>
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Owing to the fact
that Conium produces such a marked induration and infiltration of
tissues that have been inflamed, stenoses are apt to form where
inflammation has been present. Stricture of the urethra and
stenosis of the os uteri have been cured by Conium.</span></p>
