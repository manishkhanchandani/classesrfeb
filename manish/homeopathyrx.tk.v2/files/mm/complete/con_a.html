67		
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This medicine is a
68		
deep, long acting antipsoric, establishing a state of disorder in
69		
the economy that is so far reaching and so long lasting that it
70		
disturbs almost all the tissues of the body. The complaints are
71		
brought on from taking cold, and the glands become affected all
72		
over the body. Prom every little cold the glands become hard and
73		
sore. Infiltration in deep-seated diseases in the region of ulcers
74		
and in the region of inflamed parts; in the glands along the course
75		
of the lymphatics, so we get a chain like knots. The glands under
76		
the arm inflame and ulcerate. The glands in the neck, in the groin
77		
and abdomen become enlarged. Ulcerated parts indurate. An abscess
78		
of the breast becomes surrounded by lumps and nodules. Nodules in
79		
the breast even where milk has not yet formed; lumps and nodules,
80		
indurations and enlarged glands form under the skin all over the
81		
body. Con. has been used extensively for malignant affections of
82		
glands, because it takes hold of glands from the beginning and
83		
infiltrates, and they gradually grow to a stony hardness, like
84		
scirrhus. Now, another grand feature running through this remedy is
85		
the action upon the nerves. The nerves are in a state of great
86		
debility. Trembling, jerking of the muscles and twitching from the
87		
weakness of the nerves. Inability to stand any physical effort
88		
without great exhaustion. Gradually growing paralytic weakness,
89		
somewhat as was described in COCCULUS. Exhaustion of body and mind,
90		
that is, a general slowing down of all the activities of the body.
91		
The liver becomes indurated, sluggish, enlarged. The bladder is
92		
weak, can expel only a part of the urine. Or sometimes there is a
93		
paralytic condition and no expulsive power. This shows that the
94		
remedy increases toward a paralytic weakness.</span></p>
95		
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p>
96		
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Hysteria.
97		
Hypochondriacal state of mind, with the nervousness, trembling and
98		
weakness of the muscles. He gets tired in the earlier stages, but
99		
finally this goes on until the limbs are paralytic.</span></p>
100		
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">A great many of the
101		
complaints are painless. The ulcers and the paralytic conditions
102		
are painless. Great physical and mental debility; great prostration
103		
of the muscular system; exhaustion, tremulous weakness. Paralysis
104		
of the legs and hip. Mental symptoms, nervous symptoms, trembling,
105		
in widows and widowers who have suddenly been deprived of their
106		
sexual relations. When in a state of considerable vigor, if
107		
suddenly deprived, the woman or the man takes on a state of
108		
trembling weakness, inability to stand any mental effort, and
109		
inability to put the attention upon things said by others. Not so
110		
marked or not so common in the woman as in the man. When this state
111		
comes on in a woman who is of unusual sexual vigor there may be
112		
severe congestion of the uterus and ovaries, APIS is more likely to
113		
fit her symptoms man Conium. But with hysteria and excitability,
114		
Con. is often the remedy. Many of its symptoms come about from such
115		
a cause.</span></p>
116		
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Conium has such a
117		
deep action that it gradually brings about a state of imbecility.
118		
The mind gives out. The mind at first becomes tired like the
119		
muscles of the body. Unable to sustain any mental effort. The
120		
memory is weak. The mind will not concentrate, it will not force
121		
itself to attention; it cannot meditate, and then comes imbecility.
122		
Inability to stand any mental effort or to rivet the attention upon
123		
anything are some of the most important symptoms in this medicine.
124		
Insanity of a periodical type. Imbecility, though, is far more
125		
frequent than insanity. When you come to examine the mental states,
126		
you will see symptoms that will make you think the patient is
127		
delirious, but that is not quite it. It is a slow-forming weakness
128		
of mind; not that rapid, active state, such as accompanies a fever;
129		
it is a delirium without a fever, so to speak, which is not
130		
constant. Forms of insanity that is passive. He thinks slowly, and
131		
he continues in this stage for weeks and months, if he recovers at
132		
all. Those excitable cases that have more or less violence and
133		
activity in mental states are such as will correspond to BELL.,
134		
HYOS., STRAM. and ARS. You see nothing of that in this medicine.
135		
This state of tile mind has come on so gradually that the family
136		
has not observed it. The mind is full of strange things that have
137		
come little by little, and when the family look over the many
138		
things that he has done and said they begin to wonder if he is not
139		
becoming insane, but he is travelling toward a state of imbecility.
140		
Conium is of a slow, passive character. Complete indifference;
141		
takes no interest in anything, particularly when walking in the
142		
open air. "He is averse to being near people and to talking of
143		
those passing him; is inclined to seize hold of and abuse them."
144		
That, of course, is an insane act. "Sad and gloomy. Great
145		
unhappiness of mind, recurring every fourteen days," showing a two
146		
weeks' periodicity. The Conium patient will sit and mope in the
147		
corner in a state of sadness and depression, giving no reason only
148		
that he is so sad. A hypochondriacal subject going around with
149		
whims and notions that people attempt to reason him out of and the
150		
more they attempt to reason with him the more sad he is. Morose,
151		
peevish, vexed. Everything vexes and disturbs him. Cannot endure
152		
any kind of excitement, it brings on physical and mental distress,
153		
brings on weakness and sadness. Sometimes Conium symptoms will be
154		
found in persons who have suffered from grief; they become broken
155		
in memory. This is likely to come first. They forget, never can
156		
recall things just as they want them. And so they grow weaker and
157		
weaker until they become imbeciles. If it is decidedly mental,
158		
imbecility results; if it is taking a physical course the ending is
159		
paralysis, and it is not uncommon for a general paralytic weakness
160		
to come on, so that body and mind progress toward weakness together
161		
until some decided manifestation is made, and then it will be seen
162		
to be going toward paralysis, or some decided manifestation is made
163		
which will send it toward imbecility, and then the body will seem
164		
to remain stationary. There comes a time in these cases where there
165		
is a sort of division between the body and the mind. Whenever under
166		
homeopathic treatment, the physical improves and the mental grows
167		
worse, that patient will never be cured. There are such cases. I
168		
never like to see the physical grow better and the mental grow
169		
worse in any degree. That does not mean the aggravation caused by
170		
the remedy. If the mental does not improve, it means that the
171		
patient is growing worse. There is no better evidence of the good
172		
action of a remedy than mental improvement.</span></p>

<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Conium patients
176		
cannot endure even the slightest alcoholic drink. Any wine or
177		
stimulating beverage will bring on trembling, excitement, weakness
178		
of mind and prostration. There are many headaches in these
179		
patients. Patients going into decline will manifest headaches.
180		
Stitching, tearing pains in the head; throbbing in the head. Signs

<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Weakness of muscles.
183		
Weakness of muscles on one side of the face. Paralysis of the upper
184		
lids. Tingling pains. These are only in keeping with the signs of a
185		
general breakdown. We would not think of giving Conium for those
186		
sudden, violent congestions of the brain, or sudden, violent
187		
attacks of pain in the head, face or eyes, but those that accompany
188		
a general progressive disease. There are stitching, lancinating,
189		
knife-like pains along the course of nerves about face and eyes and
190		
head. Stitching in the top of the head. Burning on top of the head.
191		
Often the symptoms will lead the homeopathic physician to make a
192		
physical examination. A great deal more important than the physical
193		
examination are the symptoms that point out a remedy.</span></p>
194		
<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Excitement will
195		
bring on headaches. Numbness of the scalp is one of the common
196		
symptoms of Conium. It is a general; wherever there is trouble
197		
there will be numbness, numbness with pains, very often numbness
198		
with the weakness. Paralytic conditions are attended with numbness.
199		
Sick headache with inability to urinate. Great giddiness.
200		
Everything in the room seems to go around. Confused feeling in the
201		
head. Often sits lost in thought. Vertigo and pressure in the head
202		
with unaltered pulse. Vertigo worse from stooping. The slightest
203		
spiritous drink intoxicates him. Vertigo when turning the head,
204		
like turning in a circle, when rising from a seat; worse when lying
205		
down, AS THOUGH THE BED WERE TURNING IN A CIRCLE; WHEN TURNING IN
206		
BED or when looking around. The vertigo most common in Conium is
207		
that which comes on while LYING IN BED ROLLING THE EYES or TURNING
208		
THE EYES. This is somewhat as it is in COCCULUS, not as to vertigo
209		
alone, but the general slowed down condition of the
210		
muscles.</span></p>

<p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The paresis or
213		
weakness of the muscles all over the body is also present in the
214		
eyes. There is a muscular weakness of all the muscles of the eye,
215		
so that the Conium patient is unable to watch moving objects
216		
without getting sick headaches, visual and mental disturbances.
217		
Riding on the cars, watching things in rapid motion, and inability
218		
to focus rapidly-slowness of the accommodation is what we must call
219		
it-is the cause for many sicknesses. Inability to follow moving
220		
objects with sufficient rapidity and a headache comes on. "Objects
221		
look red, rainbow-colored, striped; confused spots; double vision;
222		
weakness of sight. Shortsighted; cannot read long without letters
223		
running together." All this is due to defective accommodation.
224		
"Sluggish adaptation of the eye to varied range of vision. Vision
225		
becomes blurred when he is irritable. Weakness and dazzling of the
226		
eyes, together with dizziness. AVERSION TO LIGHT WITHOUT
227		
INFLAMMATION OF THE EYES." The pupil will not accommodate itself to
228		
the changes between strong light and dim light, and he suffers from
229		
it. Severe photophobia and lachrymation. Photophobia without
230		
congestion of any tissue without or within the globe of the eye.
231		
Sometimes the pupils are contracted and sometimes dilated. Conium
232		
has cured ulcer of the cornea. "Burning in the eyes when reading."
233		
Shooting, smarting, cutting, burning pain in the eyes. The lids
234		
indurate, thicken and are heavy and fall. It is with difficulty
235		
that he can lift them up. So this paralysis extends all through the
236		
muscles of the body and affects the mind similarly. "Could scarcely
237		
raise the eyelids, they seemed pressed down by a heavy weight.
238		
Burning on entire surface of lids; hordeola; paralysis of muscles
239		
of the eyes."</span></p>

is that of swelling of the glands about the face, ear and under the

Enlargement of the glands of the side of the neck in cancerous

paralysis of the oesophagus; difficulty in swallowing; food goes

down part way and stops. As food is about to pass the cardiac
256		
orifice it stops and enters with a great effort. "Strange rising in
257		
the throat, with sense of stuffing, as if something were lodged
258		
there. Sense of fullness in the throat as of a lump, with
259		
involuntary attempts at swallowing. Fullness in throat with
260		
suppressed eructations. Pressure in oesophagus as if a round body
261		
were ascending from stomach." That is a nervous affection found in
262		
nervous women and has been called globus hystericus. When a woman
263		
feels as if she wanted to cry, and she swallows and chokes, she
264		
will have a similar lump in the throat. Nervous, broken-down
265		
constitutions; tired of life; sees nothing in the future but
266		
sickness and sorrow and paralysis or imbecility. When they have
267		
their lucid moments, they weep, become sad over their enlarged

stomach troubles; ulceration of the stomach; cancer of the stomach.
272		
Conium is one of the greatest palliatives in symptoms of the
273		
stomach when all the symptoms agree. It will palliate cancerous
274		
conditions for a while, and then on comes the difficulty again,

because when the symptoms have advanced sufficiently to indicate

Lancinating pains are spoken of. "Ill effects of bruises and shocks

pains and filling up of the veins of the lower limbs. Rheumatic
348		
pains; paralysis of the lower limbs; ulceration. And the sufferings
349		
and conditions are BETTER BY LETTING THE LIMBS HANG DOWN. Conium
350		
differs from a great many medicines. It is common for pains and
351		
aches to be relieved by putting the feet up on a chair; by putting
352		
them up in bed. But the patient with the rheumatism, with the
353		
ulceration of the legs and the other strange sufferings of the
354		
legs, will lie down and permit his legs to hang over the bed up as
355		
far as the knee. That is something that somebody ought to undertake

361		
feature of the remedy; he sweats copiously during sleep. Sometimes

the patient will say that if he merely closes the eyes he will
363		
sweat. It is certainly true on closing the eyes preparatory to
364		
going to sleep he will break out in a sweat.</span></p>
365		
<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Owing to the fact
366		
that Conium produces such a marked induration and infiltration of
