The eyeballs become prominent and congested from coughing during measles and in convulsions. Stitching pain in the eyes. Noises in the ears, roaring, humming and drumming. Earache in children. Stitching in the ears. Bleeding from various orifices, especially from the nose, throat, larynx, and chest when coughing, in connection with the spasmodic coughs. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">FACE</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Ordinarily the face is pale and sunken with heat of the face and he has cold extremities, except when coughing, at which time the face becomes red, congested, and purple like BELL. and CUPR.

Hoarseness and continued irritation causing coughing and continued irritation and scraping of the larynx. Accumulation of mucus in the larynx, dryness in the larynx, spasms of the epiglottis. Violent spasmodic cough from tickling in the larynx.
