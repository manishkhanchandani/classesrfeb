		<span><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">HYDRASTIS CANADENSIS</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Hydr.)</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Hydrastis is a slow, deep acting remedy, required in many trophic disturbances, where there is emaciation, catarrhal conditions and ulceration, even malignant ulceration. Defective assimilation. When it is noticed that the stomach is the center of most of the symptom complex. The desires and aversions often give the key to a very complex totality of symptoms. In this remedy the sinking empty hunger with loathing of food is striking, strange, rare, and therefore peculiar. It is characteristic because it is a general of the remedy, and is predicated of the patient. Great weakness prevails at all times. Catarrhal symptoms with thick, viscid, ropy, YELLOW mucus, sometimes white, from any mucous membrane, with or without ulceration. Deep eating spreading ulcers upon the skin or mucous membrane, with thick, viscid, yellow pus. Induration in glands, in base of ulcers. False granulations that bleed much and easily, on the slightest touch. This remedy has been very useful in the treatment of malignant ulcers. In such ulcers it is often a great comfort to the patient, even when it does not cure, as it removes the offensiveness, modifies the pain and restrains the destructiveness. The burning so commonly found in such ulcers is a strong symptom of Hydrastis. When the weakness and emaciation have progressed together for months and years in chronic stomach disease, fainting comes on, and this is also found in Hydrastis. In chronic cases, when the tissues have suffered and not the mind. The astonishing absence of mental symptoms except the general discouragement incidental to long suffering and weakness is striking. If it were carefully proved, most likely the mental loves and hates would come out. The symptoms are better during rest. Small wounds bleed and suppurate.</span></p><p class="csA2081E9A"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The headaches are only such as generally belong to stomach disorders, and prolonged nasal catarrh.
