		<span><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">KALI ARSENICOSUM</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Kali-ar.)</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This is a very deep, long acting remedy, and one greatly abused by traditional medicine in the form of Fowler's Solution. It was used extensively as an antiperiodic after quinine had failed, and as a tonic, for skin diseases of all sorts, for syphilis, for anaemia, etc. It is a most positive remedy in all of these complaints, when it suits the patient's symptoms. The toxicological symptoms following the traditional abuse have furnished a broad beginning for the homeopathist to build upon. How well it was known to the good old doctor that Fowler's Solution must be stopped if the patient became pale, waxy, puffed under the eyes and was weak. Who does not know the "fattening" powers of this drug! Horses become fat and shiny of coat after taking Fowler's Solution for a while. The jockey knew this too well. He traded off a broken-down horse as a fine animal, but the horse soon gave out; his wind was short; he would sweat easily, become weak and incapable of work. It was then said: "That horse must have been jockeyed up on arsenic." The old medical journals are full of effects of overdosing with this drug. A summary of old school drugging, a few pathogenetic symptoms, and extensive clinical observation with the use of this remedy in potentized form, have given the basis of this study. Not too much reliance should be placed upon the writer's clinical opinion; let the remedy be tested along the lines indicated until provings shall fix the finer action.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">While it has morning and evening aggravation, the nights are full of suffering; midnight especially, and from 1 to 3 a.m., there are many sufferings. The chilliness is very marked. Extreme sensitiveness to cold and complaints are aggravated from cold, from cold air and from becoming cold, from entering a cold place. Aversion to open air. Takes cold from a draft, and from being heated. Anaemia. Chlorosis. Pale, waxy, and covered with sweat. Ascending brings on suffocation, cough, and manifests the weakness of body and limbs. Glands dwindle and the extremities become numb and prickly. Molecular death prevails extensively. Cancerous ulceration has been restrained by this remedy many times. It has cured lupus.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The weakness that it has produced is much like that found in patients looking toward phthisis and Bright's disease. Clonic spasms have been produced by it. Convulsive action of muscles with full consciousness is not uncommon. It has cured epilepsy and hysterio-epilepsy. It has caused abdominal dropsy and oedema of all the limbs, face and eyelids. While taking it there is an increase of flesh and weight, but after stopping it the prover emaciates. Most complaints are aggravated after eating and after exertion. The muscles are flabby. Faintness and fainting spells. Eating ice cream when overheated brings on many complaints. Aggravated from cold foods, cold drinks, milk and fat food. There is formication all over the body. It sets up inflammation in many organs and glands, especially the stomach, liver and kidneys. Great dread of motion. All mucous membranes become catarrhal. It is a most painful remedy; burning, stitching and tearing. The most marked periodicity is every third day. Pulsation felt all over the body. It is a deep acting antipsoric, and often useful in rheumatic and gouty affections. It has cured syphilis in the hands of the traditional doctor, and in the highest potencies it cures many specific complaints-when the symptoms agree. Some symptoms come on first falling asleep, but during and after sleep are also marked times of aggravation. Rheumatic and gouty stiffness of all the joints with oedema of legs and feet. Swelling from inflammation of joints and glands. Trembling from noise, or sudden unexpected motion. Tension of muscles. Twitching of muscles. Extremely sensitive to touch. Ulceration of skin, especially of legs and of mucous membranes, with burning and spreading. Uncovering brings on the pains, and increases many complaints. Symptoms aggravated on waking. Walking fast aggravates most symptoms, especially the breathing and weakness. Warmth ameliorates most complaints. He is so weak he cannot sit up in bed. The restlessness of arsenic is often present.</span></p><p class="csA2081E9A"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Arsenicum is stamped upon the mental symptoms. Anxiety even to great anguish, with great fear. Anxiety in the morning on waking, but most marked in the evening and during the night. He is anxious without cause, about his health; anxious before stool; wakens during the night with anxiety and fear. He fears to go to bed. He fears death, or a crowd of people, yet equally dreads being alone. Fear that something will happen. Fear of people. He is very easily frightened and startled. He has frightful delusions and sees images. He despairs of recovery, he sees dead people in his nightly delirium. His thoughts dwell upon death, and he is sure he is going to die. He is very fretful, and dislikes to answer questions. He behaves like a crazy man. Fickle-minded, with confusion. Constantly discontented. Very excitable. Mental exertion intensifies mental and head symptoms. Always in a hurry, and very excitable. Many hysterical symptoms, with cramps and fainting. Indifference to all pleasure. Cannot settle upon what he wants to do. Wakens up in the morning very fretful. He is irritable during chill, and during headache. He has impulses to do violence to his friends, to kill somebody.
