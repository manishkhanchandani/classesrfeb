		<span><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">KALI SULPHURICUM</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Kali-s.)</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Two very deep acting remedies unite to form this one. It was left to Schuessler to show its first curative powers. Dewey's work on the "Tissue Remedies" gives the best presentation from the biochemic view. The writer gathered the symptoms from reported cures for many years, and found that they were justified by the study of the two remedies entering into the formation. Many of these symptoms come out upon the sick as aggravations. Some of these are only cured symptoms. This arrangement could be improved upon much by provings. If the reader will carefully use this remedy as herein directed he will be astonished at its depth of action, and if he uses it high he will be surprised at the length of action of every dose. It has cured epilepsy, lupus and epithelioma, and many desquamating skin affections. It has cured most obstinate cases of chronic intermittent fever. It is useful in catarrhal affections with thick yellow or greenish pus, viscid or THIN YELLOW WATERY DISCHARGES. Most symptoms are aggravated in the evening. The patient craves fresh and even cold air, and he is ameliorated in open air and cool air. Aggravation by exertion and becoming heated. Complaints come on during rest, and are ameliorated by motion. Complaints aggravated in warm room. Takes cold from being overheated. When once heated he cannot cool off without taking cold. PREDISPOSITION TO PHTHISIS. It is frequently indicated after TUBERCULINUM. Epileptiform convulsions. Jerking of the limbs and twitching of muscles. Dropsical condition of the extremities. Loss of flesh, and complaints aggravated after eating. Fasting ameliorates many symptoms. Flabby muscles. Fatty degeneration of glands, liver and heart. Heaviness of limbs and weariness of the body. Hysterical symptoms. Sluggishness of the body and lack of physical irritability. Well selected remedies fall short in action. Wants to lie down, but lying in bed aggravates; he must walk about to ameliorate his sufferings. Surging of blood in the body. Pain in the limbs, bones and glands. WANDERING PAINS. Pains ameliorated by motion, ameliorated walking, ameliorated in open air; aggravated in a warm room, aggravated sitting or lying, or rest in any form. The pains are burning, CUTTING, jerking, STITCHING and TEARING. ULCERATIVE PAINS. Tearing downward in the limbs. Tearing in glands and muscles. PULSATION ALL OVER THE BODY. Touch aggravates many symptoms. Many symptoms appear ON WAK ING. Trembling and quivering. Walking ameliorates. Warm coverings aggravate, warm room aggravates, warm bed aggravates, warm wraps aggravate; bathing aggravates. Complaints dating back to suppressed eruptions. Post scarlatinal nephritis. One does not need to reflect to perceive this is PULSATILLA somewhat intensified. It takes up the work and finishes as a complement of PULSATILLA, unless, as in some instances, the patient becomes a cold and chilly subject and is better during rest, and then SILICEA often will be found to have what symptoms remain. It is usual for a patient under a deep acting remedy to go to opposite modalities, and hence PULS. is so often followed by SILICEA; but this is not always true. When PULS. has acted well for a time and because of opposite modalities SILICEA does good work for a while, and then the patient swings back to the original state, symptoms and modalities, then it is that Kali-s. is of great usefulness. What occurs is the same as when SULPH., CALC. and LYC. have rotated in a given case too deep to be cured by a single remedy and a series of remedies has been what was required because the symptoms changed in such a manner that such a series was homeopathically suited.</span></p><p class="csA2081E9A"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Quite unlike PULSATILLA, this patient is easily angered and obstinate and VERY IRRITABLE.

Concentration of mind difficult, and want of self-confidence. Confusion in the evening and in the morning, in a warm room, ameliorated in open air. DULLNESS OF MIND discouraged and discontented with everything. Extremely EXCITABLE and MENTAL EXERTION AGGRAVATES. Fear at night of death, of falling, and of people. Frightened at trifles, and forgets what he was going to do and to say. He is always in a hurry, as if excited. Impatient and impetuous. Hysterical and excited in the evening, and mind active. Cannot make up his mind to do and act. Very irritable in the morning on waking, in the evening and during menses. Misplaces words in writing. Alternating moods. Changeable disposition. Restlessness during menses. Low spirited morning and evening. OVERSENSITIVE to noise. Mental symptoms from sexual excesses. Walking in sleep. Shrieking.
