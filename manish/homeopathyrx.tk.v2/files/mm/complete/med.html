		<span><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">MEDORRHINUM</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Med.)</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">One of the many uses of this remedy is in the inherited complaints of children. The physician of long and active experience meets many obstinate cases in children. The infant soon emaciates and becomes marasmic, or a child becomes asthmatic, or suffers with vicious catarrh of nose or eyelids, or has ringworm on the scalp or face, or is dwarfed; and after some waste of time it comes to mind that the father was treated for gonorrhoea that was obstinate and perhaps had condylomata on the genitalia. This remedy will cure, or begin the recovery. The woman married several years desires to become a mother. She was healthy when she married, but now she has ovarian pains, menstrual troubles, she has lost all sexual response, is growing pale and waxy, and becoming violently sensitive and nervous. The husband's history gives the cause, and this remedy will cure. The pale waxy young men, who crave stimulants and tobacco, who are sensitive to drafts, become stiff after exertion and walking, who perspire easily and are extremely sensitive to cold, who have never been well since having a gonorrhoea cured by injections. Rheumatic symptoms in every part of the body. Some symptoms are worse in the daytime. The usual comparison with SYPHILINUM, which reads, "Med. in daytime and SYPH. at night," does not hold good as a sweeping statement. It is true that many SYPH. pains are worse nights. It is true that some sycotic and Medorrhinum symptoms are worse daytimes. It is also true that many sycotic symptoms are violent day and night. It is also true that the mental symptoms of Med. are most violent at night. It will not do to be too sweeping with circumstances of this nosode. The rheumatic inflammations are worse from motion, but where swelling is not present these patients act like RHUS patients; they are sensitive to cold, suffer from aching and torturesome pains, and find relief only in motion-like RHUS. Most sycotic patients suffer from cold, some are sensitive to heat. Sore, bruised and lame, as if he had taken a deep cold and was coming down with a fever. The pains come on with a feeling of general tension. Obstinate cases of rheumatism. Losing flesh. Walks stooped, becoming clumsy. Stumbles. Looks as if he were going into quick consumption. Intense nervous sensibility, respecting touch of garment or a lock of hair by any one not EN RAPPORT.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Trembling and quivering; growing steadily weaker. INTENSE FORMICATION all over the body. Starts from the slightest noise. Feels faint and wants to be fanned. Wants open air. Cold and pulseless, with cold sweat. OEDEMA OF THE LIMBS with great soreness and dropsy of serous sacs. Externally sensitive to cold damp weather. SUBJECT TO NEURALGIAS. Stitching, tearing pains. The pains are ameliorated by heat. Drawing pains in back and limbs. The patient is extremely sensitive to pain. The remedy should never be used low.</span></p><p class="cs3B54119A"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Forgetful of facts, figures and names; of what he has read. Makes mistakes in writing, of spelling, and words. TIME MOVES TOO SLOWLY; everybody moves too slowly. He is in a constant hurry, in such a hurry that he gets out of breath. She is in such a hurry that she feels faint. Confusion of mind dazed; fear of sensation; loses the idea when speaking. Great difficulty in stating her symptoms loses herself and must be asked over again. Thinks some one is behind her; hears whispering. Sees faces that peer at her from behind the furniture (PHOS.). Everything seems unreal (ALUM.). Wild desperate feeling as if incipient insanity. Weeps when talking. Exhilaration in evening. Changeable state of mind; one moment sad, the next mirthful. Presentiment of death. Frightened sensation on waking as if something dreadful had happened. FEAR OF THE DARK. Anxiety about her salvation.</span></p><p class="cs3B54119A"><span class="cs243F98C">VERTIGO</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Vertigo when stooping; ameliorated lying; aggravated on motion. Fear of falling.</span></p><p class="cs3B54119A"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Wandering neuralgia of head, worse in cold damp weather. Sharp pains come and go suddenly. No part of head is free from pain. Pain aggravated from light, and on coughing. Burning pains deep in, as if in brain. Extreme tension of scalp. Band across forehead. Pain in occiput and nape, aggravated on motion. Intense itching of scalp. Herpetic eruptions on scalp; ringworm. Copious dandruff. Hair dry and crispy.</span></p><p class="cs3B54119A"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE-VISION</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Flickering before the eyes. Blurred vision, and black or brown spots in the field of vision. Objects look double, or small. Sees imaginary objects. Eyes feel drawn. Tension in the muscles. Pain in eyes on turning them. Sensation of sand in eyes. Sensation of sticks. Inflammation of conjunctiva with ulceration of the cornea. Blepharitis with much swelling. Lids stuck together in the morning. Margins red and excoriated. Ptosis. Smarting of lids. Eyelashes fall out. Swelling under eyes, as in Bright's disease.</span></p><p class="cs3B54119A"><span class="cs243F98C">EAR-HEARING</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Impaired hearing and total deafness. Imagines he hears voices or people in conversation. At first the hearing is very acute. Pain along Eustachian tubes into ears. Crawling in ears. Itching in ears. Stitching pains in ears.</span></p><p class="cs3B54119A"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This remedy cures obstinate nasal catarrh, also post nasal obstruction with loss of smell. Mucus, white or yellow. A middle aged man was cured of an obstinate nasal discharge by Med. very high and a discharge from the urethra which had been suppressed many years before came back and acted like a chronic gleet, and finally subsided without other treatment. Bleeding from the nose, and bloody nasal discharge. Nose sensitive to inhaled air. Itching and crawling in nose.</span></p><p class="cs3B54119A"><span class="cs243F98C">FACE</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The greenish yellow, waxy, sickly face of the sycotic patient looks like that of the ARSENIC patient, but strange to say, ARSENIC does not otherwise correspond to the symptoms, but may be mistaken for it. The skin shines, and is often covered by blotches and there are fever blisters about the mouth. Herpes on the face. Epithelioma of wing of nose, or on lip. Rheumatic pains and stiffness of face. Swelling of the submaxillary glands. </span></p><p class="cs3B54119A"><span class="cs243F98C">MOUTH-TEETH-THROAT</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The teeth are always sensitive when chewing. The taste is perverted, and the tongue is foul and white at base. The mouth is full of canker sores. Ulcers in the mouth and on the tongue. The breath is foul. Stringy mucus in mouth and throat. Mouth dry and feels burnt. Catarrh of throat and thick white mucus is constantly drawn from posterior nares.</span></p><p class="cs3B54119A"><span class="cs243F98C">STOMACH</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Ravenous hunger, even after eating. Unquenchable thirst. Craves stimulants, tobacco, sweets, green fruit, ice, sour things, oranges, ale, and salt. Nausea after eating, and after drinking water. Vomiting of mucus and bile. Sour and bitter vomiting. Violent retching. Vomiting without nausea.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Gnawing in stomach, not relieved by eating or drinking. Trembling in stomach. Clawing in stomach, aggravated by drawing up the knees. Sinking in stomach. Agonizing pains in stomach.</span></p><p class="cs3B54119A"><span class="cs243F98C">ABDOMEN</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Terrible pains in liver. Grasping pains in liver and spleen. It has cured ascites. Pulsation felt in abdomen. Pain and swelling of the inguinal glands. A young man who had been in good flesh and health took gonorrhoea. He was treated by injection. Soon he began to lose flesh. He suffered from pain in the groin, which compelled him to walk bent. He became pale and waxy; stiff and lame all over, and was very sensitive to cold. Took cold frequently, which seemed never to get quite well. After Med. very high the discharge returned, and he seemed quite well. Pain in spermatic cords.</span></p><p class="cs3B54119A"><span class="cs243F98C">RECTUM-STOOL</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">This remedy has cured many cases of marasmus in infants that had inherited sycosis from a parent. Children of a sycotic father are especially subject to attacks of vomiting and diarrhoea, and emaciation. They resist well selected chronic remedies, or are only palliated by well selected remedies. After Med. high they thrive, and remedies act better. Constipation. Can pass stool only by leaning far back when straining at stool. Inactivity of the rectum. Round balls and hard lumpy stool. Oozing of moisture at the anus, smelling like fish-brine.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">KIDNEYS-URINE</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Scanty, high-colored, strong-smelling urine in a patient suffering from rheumatic lameness and stiffness.
