The most violent and important of its symptoms are those of mucous membranes, skin and periosteum. The outer surfaces of the body are in a constant state of irritation; nervous feelings, biting, tingling, itching, changing place from scratching. Even when there is nothing to be seen, there is violent itching and the patient rubs and scratches until the part becomes raw and then burns; itching changes place; the part becomes cold after scratching, cold in spots. Itching changing place after scratching, especially when associated with no visible cause. As soon as he gets warm in bed or as soon as he goes into a warm room, the itching begins. Formication, itching, biting. The patient is so nervous that he is compelled to move, to change positions.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">SKIN</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Vesicular eruptions upon the skin, running a certain course, itching, burning like fire; dries into a crust and disappears; a new crop appears near or in the same place. Vesicles form crusts beneath which is ulceration; these crusts turn white, chalk-like, are thick, tough, and leathery. They are often elevated; fluctuation beneath the crusts; pressure causes thick, white pus, sometimes yellow-white, to ooze forth; violent itching. The pains are aggravated by cold, but the itching and restlessness are worse from heat. A child tears at the eruption with its fingers when the crusts are present.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Scald-head; thick, white, elevated crusts; copious, white or yellow-white pus, often offensive, putrid; vermin are often found among the crusts. Acrid pus eating away the hair; the eruption spreads to any part of the scalp, especially to the top; it is also found beneath the ears, and about the face and chin.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Eruptions with much itching; dark, red rash with violent itching, biting, tingling, crawling, changing place by pressure, rubbing or scratching. Cases with a history of suppressed eczema or syphilis. Eruptions upon the legs and arms, on parts with poor circulation as the ears, wrists, backs of the hands; skin eruptions followed by ulcers; discharging a thick, white, offensive matter. Especially useful where eruptions have been suppressed by zinc ointment, mercurial salve, etc.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Eruptions on the face, eyes, ears and scalp in child or adult, which have disappeared under the use of some ointment and inveterate catarrhal conditions have resulted, or in which eye symptoms have developed; conjunctiva chronically swollen, ectropion, granular lids, conjunctival surfaces like raw beef; fissures in the corners of the eye; red cicatrices about the eyes where the eruptions have been; dry spots and enlarged veins about the eyes and nose; skin feels indurated.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EAR</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Ear troubles from suppressed eruptions; thickening of the mucous membranes of the ears; degeneration of the drum of the ear; deafness, otorrhoea.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Offensive and troublesome catarrh of the nose; incrustations, thickening of the mucous membrane, ulceration; he hawks thick, yellow matter out of the throat; has been cauterized, atomized, etc., and yet the offensive ozaena remains. The periosteum is affected so that it breaks down. Advanced state of atrophic degeneration of the mucous membranes of the throat and nose.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">THROAT-HEARING</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the throat, thickening, burning, chronic redness, tumefaction, smarting, soreness on swallowing; granulations and ulcerations of the throat. Perforating ulcers of the soft palate, all due to suppressed eruptions. Give the remedy and you will have a copious eruption in the original place; if not, there will be no relief. Often the deafness cannot be cured, because the drum of the ear or the whole ear is destroyed, is white, chalky, and contains no blood-vessels; a state of atrophic catarrh, so that there is too much structural change for hearing to be restored, yet the patient can be cured.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Has all the catarrhal states, the ulcerations and patches of copper-colored eruptions found in syphilis.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">When outward manifestations are pronounced, its internal manifestations are scanty. It tends to manifest the sufferings of the body on the skin; it throws the physical evils to the surface, hence, the Mez. patient is in fairly good health when the eruptions are out; when they are suppressed, then catarrhal affections, bone diseases, nervous disorders, strange mental symptoms, constipation, rheumatism, and joint symptoms appear; he becomes a mental wreck.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Religious or financial melancholy; melancholy which shapes itself upon the patient's business; indifference to everybody and everything; irritable; thought is difficult; memory weak; absent minded; has no rest when alone, yet averse to talking. Insanity with melancholy, sadness and a history of eruptions that have called for Mez.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Violent headaches and brain affections; pains rending, tearing; boring; head painful to touch; syphilitic affection of the brain; headaches through the sides of the head as if in the bone; feels as if the head would be crushed (closely related to MERC. and KALI-I.). Headache extending from the root of the nose to the forehead (MERC. and HEP). Pains in the head cause faintness (HEP.). Pains in the bones of the skull aggravated by touch; bones feel as if scraped.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The hair mats together. "Head covered with thick, leather-like crusts, under which thick, white pus collects here and there, and glues the hair together.

After the eruptions have given place to internal manifestations, the patient is chilly, sensitive to the changes of the weather, worse in stormy weather; worse after a bath, because he takes cold and his internal complaints are aggravated. The eruptions are aggravated after washing. When the eruptions are not out, the skin is hot and he wants something to cool it; he is better from cool water; there is simply redness at this time. The itching is aggravated from bathing in warm water.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">TEETH</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Ulceration about the roots of the teeth; a scrofulous condition of the gums, which bleed, settle away from the teeth; the teeth decay suddenly.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">FACE</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The face is sickly, full of ulcers, old scars, boils, etc. The anaemic face may flush up at times, but it is usually pale, gray, and waxy, expressive of a cachexia met with in some bone diseases.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOMACH</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Sensation of goneness, fear, apprehension, faintness in the stomach, as if something would happen; every shock, pain and hearing bad news, cause this apprehensive, hungry, faint, weak, all-gone feeling in the pit of the stomach. It comes on when the door-bell rings, if the patient is expecting the postman, while waiting at the depot for the arrival of a friend or the departure of the cars; on being introduced to some one, he experiences a thrill beginning in the stomach is "frightened in the stomach." CALC., KALI-C., PHOS. and Mez. have this. These "solar-plexus" individuals often have a deep cracked tongue and are hard to cure.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">CHILL</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Worse from the warmth of the bed (hence related to MERC. and syphilis).
