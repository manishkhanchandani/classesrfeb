		<span><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">NATRUM CARBONICUM</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Nat-c.)</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Proved by Hahnemann, Hering and others. Persons who are in the habit of taking carbonate of soda for sour stomach get a proving of this remedy. I have met some of these people and been able to confirm many NATRUM symptoms.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Old dyspeptics who are always belching and have sour stomach and rheumatism; after twenty years they are stoop-shouldered, pale, sensitive to cold, chilly, aggravated by the least draft; require much clothing; unable to resist the cold or the heat; require a medium climate; are worse from the changes of the weather; their digestive, rheumatic, and gouty troubles are all worse from the weather changes. A state of trepidation from the slightest noise, the slam of a door; nervous excitement and palpitation with great prostration; nervous weakness with trepidation; weakness from slight exertion of mind or body; internal and external trembling. The rattling of paper causes palpitation, irritability and melancholy. Estrangement from family and friends. Aversion to mankind and to society; to relatives, to strangers; feels a great division between himself and them; sensitive to certain persons. Music causes a tendency to suicide, melancholy, weeping and trepidation; playing the piano is so exhausting that she must lie down; music causes great sadness which increases to religious insanity. This is true of all the SODIUMS, but especially so of Nat-c.; aggravation from the slam of a door, a pistol shot, which causes headache and complaints in general, aggravated from music.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The more soda these patients take the more flatulent do they become; they are stoop-shouldered; digestion is difficult, and finally milk will not digest at all, bringing on a diarrhoea with undigested, lienteric stools; also, starch causes flatulence and looseness of the bowels. Many symptoms from drinking cold water when overheated.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Urine offensive like that of a horse, from a vegetable or milk diet. This is not so marked as in NIT-AC. but resembles it.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Nat-c. throws out eruptions upon the knuckles and finger tips; also the toes; vesicular eruptions open up and form ulcers on the joints or finger-tips. BORAX, SEPIA, ARS., and Nat-c. are the remedies most inclined to produce ulceration of the tips and knuckles of the fingers, and also the toes.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Vesicular eruptions on the body in patches and circles; the herpes family is especially related to Nat-c.; zona, herpes labialis, herpes preputialis; patches as large as a dollar on the hips, thighs and back. Smaller patches show vesicles containing a white serum; burning, smarting and itching, better from scratching. The eruption passes away with a crust, but will often ulcerate, it does not heal and an ulcer forms. Circulation feeble; wounds suppurate. Feet and skin burn. Crusty eruptions on the skin that have not been vesicular; but most Nat-c. and NAT-M. eruptions are of the vesicular form. Tingling, biting, itching, changing place, now here and now there; cold skin; sweaty body.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Nervous exhaustion, physical exhaustion, weakness of mind and body. Bookkeepers lose the ability to add up figures. In reading a page, the one previous to it soon goes out of the mind. The memory will not hold out from the beginning to the end of a sentence. Forgets what he reads. Confusion of mind follows and then he is unable to perform any mental labor. Men become so fatigued from the details of business that a confusion of the mind comes over them, they get brain fag.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Oversensitive to heat, especially after sunstroke, even some years after; has to be well shaded when walking in the sun, must seek a cool or dark place; the patient has not had the proper acute remedy during the attack; the remedy is aggravated by both cold and heat, but this is a special aggravation from the heat of the sun; head troubles are not worse from cold in Nat-c. Old cases of brain fag with weakness and trepidation. The body troubles are aggravated from cold and in the winter; as cold as if he had no blood in the body, extremities cold, and he cannot get them warm; cold as ice to the knees and elbows. The body and extremities are worse in winter, the head in summer.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Anxious trembling and sweating during pains.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The senses are all disturbed; oversensitive to light; pain in the eyes from a bright light.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEARING</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Oversensitive hearing; little noises seem enormous, like thunder; the crumpling of paper seems like the crashing of a waterfall.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MOUTH</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Taste perverted, too sensitive, so that the tasting of things ordinarily grateful becomes painful; sometimes loss of taste.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE-HEAD</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Loss of smell. Hay fever, catarrhal fever; where catarrhal conditions are present there is copious, thick, yellow, purulent discharge from the eyes, nose, vagina. The vesicles are filled with thin, white serum, but the pustule, when it ruptures, throws out a thick, yellow discharge. Leucorrhoea thick, yellow, ropy; gonorrhoea of the same character; thick, yellow, ropy, purulent discharge from the bladder which clogs up the urethra when urinating.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The discharges are commonly offensive.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Coryzas trouble much; always has a cold in the head; the watery discharge is of short duration, and is soon followed by a thick copious flow of yellow mucus. Ulceration, thick crusts; sleeps at night with the mouth open; dry, yellow crusts are blown out with pain and bleeding. The catarrh increases with each fresh cold, until it becomes foetid; the bones of the nose are affected; almost a constant headache over the eyes, in the forehead, at the root of the nose; congestive headaches, worse from change of weather, cold room, damp weather; increased by every storm.
