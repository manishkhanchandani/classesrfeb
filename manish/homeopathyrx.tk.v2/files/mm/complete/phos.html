Its complaints are found in such as are emaciated, and in those who are rapidly emaciating; in children who are going into marasmus, and in persons who have in them the foundation of consumption fairly well laid. Delicate, waxy, anaemic and emaciated subjects. In persons who are vehement, irascible. This expresses the person's disposition somewhat as well as his internal constitutional state. Internally he is in a turmoil. Subject to violent pulsations, complaints from electric changes in the atmosphere; violent palpitations and orgasms. In chlorotic girls who have grown too rapidly and have suddenly taken on weakness, pallor, green sickness, with menstrual difficulties. Ebullitions and congestions. Haemorrhagic constitutions. Small wounds bleed much; the prick of the needle will bubble forth much bright red blood. Haemorrhagia from small wounds, from the nose, from the lungs, from the stomach, from the bladder and from the uterus. Bleeding from ulcerations. False granulations that bleed. Purpura haemorrhagica. Black and blue spots. Blood settles beneath the conjunctiva, or beneath the skin anywhere. Bloody saliva; evidences of disorganized blood, or that the blood seems to become fluid. Small bruises take on broad blue spots. Blows much blood out of the nose. Petechias all over the body, such as are found in typhoid fever, low forms of continued fever with haemorrhages. Fungous growths. Fatty degeneration is a marked feature of Phosphorus, and can be found in the liver, heart or kidneys. General dropsical condition. Bloating of the hands and feet, especially dropsical conditions after scarlet fever. The mucous membranes are all pale, such as is found after bleeding or in low forms of disease. A marked state of anaemia and relaxed condition of the muscles. Muscles flabby. Fatty degeneration of the muscles. The genitals hang down. In the woman, relaxation of the pelvic organs, prolapsus and other displacements. Stiffness is a marked feature of Phosphorus. Stiffness on beginning to move. Limbs stiff like a foundered horse, especially in the morning. Rheumatic stiffness in all the limbs. Phosphorus has tearing, drawing pains in the limbs. Drawing, tearing pains in affected parts. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Phosphorus complaints are worse in cold weather. The patient himself, generally considered, is sensitive to cold. All his complaints are worse from cold and cold applications and better from heat and warm applications, except the complaints of the head and stomach, which are ameliorated from cold as will hereafter be described. Phosphorus has been very useful in weak, relaxed conditions of the joints following sprains, when the symptoms agree. Necrosis is another feature of Phosphorus, especially of the lower jaw, but may be useful in necrosis of any of the bones. Exostoses of the skull with tearing pains. Tearing, boring pains, especially at night. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Phosphorus has cured polypi of the nose and ears. Scrofulous and glandular swellings. Glands enlarge, especially after contusions like BELLIS. Glandular affections of weak, pale, sickly individuals such as suffer from diarrhoea, such as suffer from exhaustive conditions, abscesses, fistulous openings, with hectic fever. Abscesses with copious discharge of yellow pus. Malignant growths are greatly restrained by the use of Phosphorus, when the symptoms agree. Burning pains are observed everywhere. Burning in the brain, burning in the skin.

Rawness in the chest; bruised feeling in the chest; pains are cutting, burning or sharp and tearing in the lungs when coughing. Suffocation or inspiration almost impossible, especially at the beginning of hepatization when the face becomes livid and the features pointed with cold sweat and quick, hard pulse. Frothy expectoration in low forms of pneumonia known as typhoid pneumonia. Threatened paralysis of the lungs. Again, Phosphorus is a useful remedy when tuberculosis is about to make its appearance, in persons who are narrow-chested, slender, and of feeble vitality. All colds settle in the chest. After each cold, much rattling, hard cough that shakes the whole body, in persons who are feeble, pale, sickly, and disposed to haemorrhages. Cough comes on in cold air. Emaciation; emaciation of the chest and neck. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Along with these conditions comes hectic fever in the last stages of phthisis; intense fever, red face, and night sweats; fever coming on in the afternoon and lasting until after midnight. A powder of Phosphorus very high will reduce this fever and make the patient comfortable until death. In all incurable cases after the fever has been reduced, Phosphorus should not be given, as it will intensify the fever and do just what it was given to avoid. It is not uncommon for a crisis to follow the administration of Phosphorus. Prolonged sweat and diarrhoea, these should never be interfered with as they will soon stop of their own accord and the patient will be left in a state of quietude. Phosphorus is a dangerous medicine to give very high in some cases of phthisis, in the last stages of phthisis. In this case they should have received Phosphorus when they were yet curable. In these cases Phosphorus 30th may sometimes be used with safety and it will act as a test in doubtful cases to see whether reaction can be brought about. In such cases where reaction can be brought about the administration later of a still higher potency may be found useful, but in the beginning with Phosphorus in phthisical cases far advanced it is better not to go higher than the 30th or 200th. Phosphorus very low will act as a poison in really Phosphorus cases and the only safety some patients have had who have received Phosphorus so very low was due to the fact that the Phosphorus was not similar enough to either kill or cure.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Phosphorus has violent palpitation; worse from motion, and from lying on the left side especially in the evening; worse at night on waking, with orgasms of blood in the chest, accompanied by much suffocation. Tightness in the chest and palpitation over the body; pressure in the region of the heart. Phosphorus has cured endocarditis. Phosphorus has cured enlargement of the heart and dilatation and also fatty degeneration. With fatty degeneration where there is much veinous stagnation, puffiness of the face, particularly under the eyelids, Phosphorus is often the remedy. In all of these cardiac affections thirst for very cold water will always be present. Internal heat; he wants something cold to cool his insides. Violent orgasms of blood in the chest from every excitement, from worry, and from anticipation. Phosphorus has many neuralgic pains upon the outer chest and yellow brown spots. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">BACK</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There are many symptoms in the back; stiffness in the back and in the back of the neck, between the shoulders, and in the small of the back. Stiffness on rising from a seat. Sensation of intense heat in the back running up the back. The patient complains of a hot spine. Soreness in places up and down the spine; soreness to touch between the shoulders; pulsations in various places in the back and in the whole spine. The coccyx is sensitive to pressure; pain in the coccyx as if ulcerated, preventing motion. Pain in the back during menstruation and during confinement as if the back would break. Spinal affections and inflammations. Weakness of the limbs after mental exertion, prolonged physical exertion, being overheated, sunstroke and sexual excesses; paralytic weakness. Myelitis; softening of the spine; progressive spinal paralysis. Phosphorus has been a useful remedy in locomotor ataxia, palliating many of the symptoms; the pains; restoring the reflexes. Phosphorus is often suitable and restrains the progress in multiple sclerosis where there is much weakness and trembling of the extremities. Phosphorus has cured caries of the vertebrae in scrofulous children. Phosphorus is a broad remedy in various diseases of the spine.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EXTREMITIES</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In the limbs we have paralytic weakness extending to both arms and legs, with trembling and numbness; paralysis of one or of both lower extremities or of the upper extremities with trembling and numbness.
