It is especially suited to hysterical women such as have undergone fright, prolonged excitement, or from disappointment, shock, or prolonged haemorrhages. She becomes arrogant and haughty. One of the most striking characteristics of this drug is pride and over-estimate of one's self. She imagines that she is of a high born family and that her friends and relatives are of lowly origin and looks down upon them. Her acquaintances are inferior to herself. A strange thing about this remedy is that this imagination extends to the body. She imagines that her body is large and that the bodies of other people are smaller in comparison with her own. She is in a contemptuous mood, anxious and serious over matters that are not serious, irritable about trifling things, is moody and sulky over slight vexations, anxious, weeping. Palpitation, trembling in all limbs during every little excitement, fears death and loathes life. Fear is a very prominent feature in this remedy. Fears that something will happen, fears that her absent husband will never return to her, though he comes back regularly. Restless disposition, excitable, walking, moving about, and weeping.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The mental symptoms alternate with the physical symptoms. Strange illusions of fancy. Imagines that she does not belong to this race and becomes insane over religious matters, sits in the corner and broods and says nothing. Takes on insanity; becomes a sexual pervert, utters unchaste speech and trembles. Spasms will come on from vexation or anger. Whistles, sings, and dances. Talks constantly about fanciful things. She may go into melancholy or into mania. Any disturbance of her pride will bring on her symptoms. Sexual excitement will bring on her symptoms. The usual mental symptoms are intermingled with trembling of the limbs, sexual excitement, and numbness of various parts of the body and limbs. Compressing sensations, pressing pains, pressure of the limbs as if bandaged or constricted, tension of the skin of the limbs as if bandaged. These characteristic features prevail throughput the various regions of the body and modify many particulars. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Sensation of numbness of the scalp with pressing pain in the head, boring, compression of the head. Tension of the scalp, cramp-like constrictions of the scalp gradually increasing to violence, cramp-like pains gradually increasing to violence. Squeezing sensation in the head. These pains may be in the temple, in the top of the head, or in the forehead. Again, there is crawling, creeping, numbness of the scalp. Sudden shocks in the head. There is no symptom in the head more persistent than numbness of the scalp; it prevails throughout all sensations and pains. All headaches gradually increase until they are severe. Violent neuralgia in the head with sensitiveness in hysterical persons. Sometimes numbness in the head is described as if the brain were numb. Headaches come on from chagrin, from fear, from vexation, from haemorrhages, and from sexual excitement.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE-VISION</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Sparks before the eyes, spasms of the lids, and objects appear smaller than they really are. Sensation of coldness in the eyes, spasms, spasmodic trembling and twitching of the muscles of the eyes. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EAR</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Cramping pain in the ears, coldness in the ears, numbness of the external ears. The numbness of the ears extends to the face, nose and scalp. Platinum is a haemorrhagic remedy. Bleeding from various parts of the body and mucous membranes. The haemorrhages wherever observed are black clots with fluid. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">On examining the symptoms of the nose haemorrhagia is observed. Black, coagulated blood from the nose. Ovensensitive to smell. Violent crampy pains at the root of the nose with redness of the face.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">FACE-MOUTH</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Sensation of coldness of the face, numbness of the face, cramping, pressing pains in the face. Neuralgia of the face. Coldness, crawling, numbness of the face. Numbness of the malar bone. Tearing boring pain in the face.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Pulsating and digging through the lower jaw, especially the right side, together with numbness and coldness. The pains come gradually and go gradually. Sensation as if the tongue were scalded, crawling in the tongue. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOMACH-ABDOMEN</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Loss of appetite on account of the depressed mood or at other times a ravenous appetite; hasty eating, eats everything around her. Much flatulence, fermentation in the stomach. Jerking of the muscles of the stomach and abdomen. Sensation as if the whole abdomen were tightly constricted or bandaged. Tension of the skin of the abdomen. Violent, cramping pains in the abdomen, drawing pains in the navel as if by a string, which causes a sensation of retraction of the abdomen. Pressing, bearing down pains in the abdomen. These pains are much like PLUMBUM and Platinum has been used as an antidote to PLUMBUM. Pressing, drawing pains from incarcerated flatus. The torpor of the intestinal canal is much like that which is found in PLUMBUM. Inveterate constipation, much flatus.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">RECTUM-STOOL</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The stool is half digested and papescent or hard as if burnt, or may be scanty and very difficult, or may be glutinous and adherent to the anus like soft clay. Frequent urging to stool and inability to strain at stool, inveterate constipation and unsuccessful urging to stool. Pain in the abdomen after lead poisoning and colic after lead poisoning. Constipation in travelers. Prolonged efforts to pass a stool. Aching pains, burning pains and protrusion of haemorrhoids during stool. Burning in the rectum during stool. Itching, tickling, and tenesmus of the anus, especially in the evening. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-MALE</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Extreme sexual erethism is found in both male and female. In the male there is great sexual erethism driving to secret vice. It has cured epilepsy arising from onanism. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-FEMALE</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Sexual erethism is one of the most prominent features of Platinum in women. Unbearable sexual excitement and voluptuous crawling in the genitals. Such extreme sensitiveness of the external genitals that it is impossible for the woman to wear a napkin during menstruation. Such extreme sensitiveness of the vagina that it is impossible for the physician to make an examination with the index finger. It is not an inflammation but a hyperesthesia. Increased sexual excitement in young girls, in hysterical girls. Violent sexual desire in married women with itching, tingling, and voluptuous sensations. Pain in the ovarian region, especially the left. It has cured sterility of long standing, especially sterility that is supposed to come from excessive sexual excitement. Burning, stitching pains in the ovaries. Inflammation of the ovaries coming with haemorrhagia of the uterus, and during the menstrual period. It has cured ovarian tumors and cystic tumors. Inflammation of the uterus, bearing down, as in prolapsus. Prolapsed uterus and dragging in the pelvis. Polypus of the uterus and uterine haemorrhages. Copious menstrual flow. The flow is dark, even black, and clotted with much fluid blood. These nervous women constantly feel as if the menstrual flow was going to appear. The menstrual flow comes too early, is too profuse, and then generally of short duration. The haemorrhagia is somewhat like the menstrual flow in old women. The menstrual periods sometimes return every fourteen days or the menstrual flow may be entirely absent. The vulva and vagina are extremely sensitive during coition, sometimes preventing the act. The woman suffers from albuminous leucorrhoea, mostly in the daytime without much sensation. There are many complaints of pregnancy, threatened abortion, exhausting haemorrhages, discharges of black clotted blood. During labor the contractions are interrupted by sensitiveness of the vagina and internal parts. It is impossible for the obstetrician to make the usual examination. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EXTREMITIES</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Cramping in the limbs during parturition or profuse haemorrhagia; hysterical convulsions, puerperal convulsions. After every mental exertion palpitation, trembling, numbness, quivering, and excitement in the limbs. Tremulous restlessness in the legs with numbness. Cold feet. Pains in the great toe as if bandaged. This sensation prevails throughout. The limbs feel as if bandaged about the thigh or leg. The nerves are in a great state of excitement most of the time.
