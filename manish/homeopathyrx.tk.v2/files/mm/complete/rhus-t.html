The patient is sensitive to cold air and all his complaints are made worse from cold and all are better from warmth. In a general way, the aching pains, the bruised feelings over the body, restlessness throughout the limbs, and amelioration from motion are features that prevail through-out all conditions of Rhus-t. While he is better from motion and better from walking, if he continues to walk he becomes exhausted. Any continued exertion of the body or mind exhausts the Rhus-t patient. He suffers from rheumatic conditions with pains in the bones, lameness in the muscles, lameness in the tendons, ligaments, and joints from suppression of sweat, from becoming chilled. These occur with or without fever. Rhus-t is suitable in old chronic rheumatic conditions. He is stiff, lame, and bruised on first beginning to move. This passes off on becoming warmed up, but soon he becomes weak and must rest. Then comes the restlessness and aching and uneasiness which drive him to move and which again make him better, but soon he becomes weak and these continue, so that he is never perfectly at ease and never finds rest. Inflammation of the glands and of the mucous membranes; inflammation of the muscles. Cellulitis of the pelvis, of the neck, about the glands with much swelling.

The prominent projections of bones become sore to touch, especially the cheek bones. Its complaints are more or less periodical. It has cured many cases of intermittent fever, is often suitable in remittent fever, and is a most useful remedy in continued fevers and in a low form of typhoid fever. The pains that run through Rhus-t are aching, tearing, and bruised pains often attended with numbness and paralytic weakness of the limbs. It has paralysis of the limbs with loss of sensation. In infantile paralysis Rhus-t is a very common remedy. The nurse-girls at the present time often bring on in the child this paralytic condition and spinal paralysis. The nurses take the infants to the park, take them out of their carriage and put them down upon the cold damp ground and in a few days the child comes down with infantile paralysis. Rhus-t will cure these cases because the symptoms take the Rhus-t type. Hemiplegia, especially of the right side. Twitching of the limbs and muscles. It has cured chorea brought on from taking a cold bath.</span></p><p class="cs3B54119A"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Most of the mental symptoms of Rhus-t are such as prevail during low forms of fever, especially in typhoid. There is then incoherent talking; answers questions hastily. There is anxiety, apprehensions, and fear. Intense fear at night. The complaints of Rhus-t often come on in the night. The mental symptoms are worse at night. The delirium is worse at night. The fears and anxiety are worse at night. The chronic mental symptoms of Rhus-t are despondency, mental prostration, inability to sustain a mental effort, disgust for life and thoughts of suicide.

In many instances he is filled with suicidal thoughts; sadness and weeping yet he knows not why.
