The nervous manifestations of this remedy are almost indescribable and too numerous to mention. Anxiety and restlessness are words that prevail through all the conditions in it. It is much like ARS.

A strong aversion to colors, such as yellow, green, red and black. Depraved imaginations prevail through all the proving. Loss of all shame. Desire to run about, to dance and jump up and down. Great fantastic dancing. Sometimes music ameliorates all the symptoms and at other times it aggravates them.
