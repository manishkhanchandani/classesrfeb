		<span><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">ACONITUM NAPELLUS</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">(Acon.)</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Aconite is a short-acting remedy. Its symptoms do not last long. It is a violent poison in large doses, either destroying life or passing away in its effects quite soon, so that if the patient recovers, the recovery is not delayed. There are no chronic diseases following it. Like a great storm, it comes and sweeps over and passes away. By a little meditation, we will discover what kind of sickness all this is like, and what kind of a patient is most likely to have that short, sudden sickness. If we think a moment from experience and homeopathic observation, we will remember that vigorous, plethoric individuals, when they take cold, come down violently, whereas feeble people, sickly people, come down and recover slowly from acute diseases, and do not become so violently and so suddenly sick. From this, and from examining the sudden effects of Aconite, it will be easy to see that persons who come down with Aconite sicknesses are plethoric individuals. Strong, robust people, rugged children and infants become sick, not a very slight cold, or from slight exposure, but from more violent exposure. From being exposed with deficient clothing; from sudden, violent changes; from prolonged exposure to the cold, north, dry wind. A vigorous person caught out with thin clothing, or remaining out in the cold, dry air of mid-winter, with its sudden, violent changes, comes down even before night with violent symptoms. This is the class of patients, the plethoric and vigorous, who have a strong heart, active brain, vigorous circulation, and come down suddenly from violent exposure, that need Aconite.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Aconite has in its nature none of the results usually following inflammation. The storm is over so quickly that it seems mostly to conform to the earlier condition. In these vigorous patients, sudden congestions are likely to be thrown off by good reaction. The patient seems to be threatened with a sudden and violent death, but recovery is quick. So, as was observed by Dunham, it is a great storm and soon over. Dunham's discussion of this remedy in his Materia Medica is very poetical and well worth reading.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Attacks come on suddenly from exposure to a dry, cold wind. In plethoric children, we have an illustration of that in the sudden congestion of the brain with intense fever, or with convulsions. We get illustrations of its suddenness and violence in any organ of the body, the brain, the lungs, the liver, the blood, and the kidneys. It is suited to the complaints that come on SUDDENLY FROM THE VERY COLD WEATHER of winter, or from the INTENSELY HOT WEATHER of summer. It has the lung and brain complaints of winter, and the bowel inflammations and stomach disorders of summer. We know how these plethoric individuals become suddenly overheated and become violently sick. Their sudden attacks are frightful to look upon. All these inflammatory conditions are attended with great excitement of the circulation, violent action of the heart, a tremendous turmoil of the brain, a violent shock with intense fear.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MIND</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The mind symptoms that are nearly always associated with Aconite conditions stand out in bold relief. The patient feels the violence of his sickness, for he is under great nervous irritation and excitement. Fear is depicted upon his countenance, and the heart's action is so overwhelming the first thing he thinks of is that he must die; this must mean death, which he fears. It stands out upon his countenance. He says: "Doctor, there is no use; I am going to die." Many times, he actually predicts the moment or THE HOUR OF HIS DEATH. If a clock is in the room, he may say that when the hour hand reaches a certain point he will be a corpse. WHEN WE SEE THIS INTENSE FEAR, THIS AWFUL ANXIETY, GREAT RESTLESSNESS, THE VIOLENCE AND THE SUDDENNESS OF THESE ATTACKS, we have a case, perhaps, that is dying from the poison of Aconite, or one who needs Aconite. One who has a sickness resembling the poison of Aconite needs the smallest possible dose of Aconite. It is a very short-acting medicine, and that must be remembered.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It hardly matters what part of the body we are considering we will find inflammatory conditions. But regardless of the region or the locality of the inflammation, that which I have described is the appearance of the patient. Such are the symptoms that will stand out, that you will observe first- the appearance of the face, the mind symptoms, the restlessness, the intensity. Now, there are many little mental symptoms that are of much less importance than this fear, this anxiety, symptoms that will be masked by these marked symptoms that indicate the patient. He has lost all affection for his friends. He does not care what becomes of them, he has not the slightest interest in them. It sometimes may be a state of indifference.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">What I have brought out will enable one to readily see that this picture does not belong to all the remedies in the Materia Medica. In fact, it belongs only to Aconite. No matter what remedy you compare this with, you would find it only under Aconite. You will find SOME of the features in the text under other remedies, but those, which I have mentioned collectively, will be found only under Aconite. Take the mental symptoms, intensity marks every one of them. If it is a delirium, it is an intense delirium, WITH EXCITEMENT, WITH FEAR, WITH ANXIETY. Patients in delirium, with excitement and fear, will weep as in great torment. GREAT EXCITEMENT, FEAR, FEAR OF DEATH. You wonder what she is weeping about. There are all sorts of moods intermingled also with the fear of Aconite. There is moaning and irritability, anger, throwing things away, all attended with THE VIOLENCE AND ANXIETY. These features that I described as uppermost are intermingled with all the other symptoms.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"SCREAMS WITH PAIN." The pains are like knives, they are stinging, cutting, stabbing. The intensity of the Aconite suffering is wonderful, so that if the nerves take on neuralgic pains THE PAINS ARE INTENSE. It is the feeling that some awful thing must be upon him or he could not have such dreadful suffering. It says in the text, "predicts the day of his death." This to a great extent is the result of the awfulness that seems to be overwhelming him. And this mental picture is always present, in pneumonia, in inflammatory conditions of any part of the body, in inflammation of the kidneys, of the liver, of the bowels, etc.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">VERTIGO</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">DIZZINESS prevails throughout all this symptom picture. "Vertigo, turning and whirling." A woman out shopping runs up suddenly against a dog and becomes violently dizzy, she cannot even get to her carriage. "Vertigo that comes on from fear, from sudden fear, and the fear of the fright remains."</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There is a remnant of that fear left, but it will lead you on more strongly towards OPIUM. "COMPLAINTS FROM FEAR. Inflammation of the brain from fear, dizziness from fear." EVEN CONGESTION OF PARTS AS A RESULT OF FEAR. Turmoil in the whole sensorium. Things go round and round.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">HEAD</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The HEADACHES can hardly be described, they come with such violence. Tearing burning in the brain, in the scalp, attended WITH FEAR, WITH FEVER, WITH ANGUISH; headache from taking cold, from suppressing catarrh in the nose. Catarrh stops suddenly in plethoric people, from exposure, from riding in the dry, cold wind such as, we have in this northern climate in winter. "Violent headache over the eyes. Congestion of the brain, with congestive headache, WITH ANXIETY, WITH HOT FACE."</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EYE -FEVER</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The symptoms that would lead you to give Aconite for affections of the eye are numerous. Eyes take on sudden inflammation. Congestion of the eye. Blood red appearance of the eye. Sudden inflammation of all the tissues; conjunctivitis, etc., from TAKING COLD, FROM EXPOSURE TO DRY, COLD WINDS.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">There is a teaching that has long prevailed: give Aconite for the first stage of an inflammation. It is not good teaching, although it is recommended in all of our books. It does not say for what kind of a constitution, or how it comes about. Do not practice that way. Get all the elements for an Aconite case, if possible, or give a better remedy. Another practice has prevailed, viz., giving Aconite for fever. Aconite was the fever remedy of many of our early routinists, but it is a bad practice.</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Aconite has an inflammation of the eyes that comes on so suddenly that one wonders how that inflammation came in so short a time. The eyes take on great swelling without any discharge, or only very watery mucus. The sudden inflammations that come on with thick discharges would never be Aconite. Aconite has no results of inflammation. Those conditions that are about to take on the results of inflammation will always indicate some other remedy. You are not to think of Aconite in fever unless the Aconite patient is present. With the Aconite fever, there will be sensitiveness to light. "Great restlessness with fever." Eyes staring, with pupils contracted, "violent aching and inflammation of the deep structures of the ball." Give Aconite only when the symptoms agree. An inflammation that is about to run a prolonged course, to take on suppuration, or if it is mucous membrane to take on discharge of pus, will never show you the symptoms of Aconite. Never give Aconite in blood poisoning, such as we find in scarlet fever, in typhoid fever, etc. We find nothing of the violent symptoms of Aconite in such conditions. The nervous irritation is never present, but the opposite, the stupor, the laziness, the purple skin- whereas Aconite is bright red. Never give Aconite for any form of zymosis, for it has no zymotic history. There should be no thought of Aconite in the slow coming, continued fever. Aconite has no symptoms like the slow types of continued fevers. The Aconite fever is generally one short, sharp attack of fever. It is in no way related to an intermittent fever, as it has no such symptoms. You might find something that would deceive you in one attack of intermittent fever, but the very fact that there was a second one would shut out Aconite. Some remedies have periodicity or waves. Aconite has no such a condition. The most violent attack of fever will subside in a night if Aconite is the remedy. If it is not it is a pity that you made a mistake in giving it, for it will sometimes do mischief. All things that exist in a sickness must be taken into account, not only what the remedy does cover, but what it does not cover.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Aconite has inflammation of the eyes, with burning and sudden swelling; the lids swell so rapidly that they cannot be opened except with great difficulty, and when they are forced open by seizing the margins of the lids with a pair of forceps drops of hot water will fall out, but no pus. This comes on rapidly from taking cold; whenever there are inflammations of the mucous surfaces bloody water is apt to flow. Suddenly the blood vessels become engorged, ooze, the blood vessels rupture, and the capillaries ooze.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EAR</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Inflammation of the EAR comes on just as suddenly. "Throbbing, intense, cutting pains in the ear." The child comes home after being out in the cold north wind, and is not sufficiently clad, and now it screams and puts its hand to the ear. The attack comes on early in the evening, after being out in the daytime. Fever and anxiety; child must be carried. The suffering is intense. Noise intolerable. Music goes through every limb, so intense is the sense of hearing. Everywhere in the body will we find that same intense condition of the nerves. Wherever there are complaints they are intense, violent, and the patient is always in a state of anxiety and irritability. "Stinging, burning, rending, tearing, cutting pains in the ear."</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">NOSE</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Coryza if attended with violent headache, coming on in the night after exposure and taking cold during the day, suddenly, this short-acting, very quick-acting remedy will be indicated. The coryza that comes on from Carb-v. comes on several days after the exposure. The coryza that comes on from Sulph</span><span class="csA62DFD6A">.</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> also develops several days after the exposure. The Carb-v. patient becomes overheated and takes cold by keeping on his overcoat when he comes into your office. In Aconite he goes out in cold air with his light clothing, and comes down, if he is a plethoric individual, before midnight. But especially is it often indicated in the coryza of the rosy, chubby, plethoric baby. Not in the sickly or pale ones. These sickly ones will come down later; their vital activities are so reduced that their complaints do not come on sometimes for two or three days. So that if you take a sickly one and a vigorous one in the same family and expose them both one will have croup tonight and need Aconite, and the other will have it the next morning and need Hep.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The symptoms likely to occur with coryza are nosebleed, headache, anxiety and fear. The anxious expression is one of the first things observed in the Aconite sufferer. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">FACE</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The Aconite pneumonia will often show itself on the face. Look at the face; there is great anxiety. It shows much of the proving of Aconite. You know there is much in the expression of the face that will enable one to read all that is going on in the body; it tells the story. The pleasures and sadness, and the distress of the human family, much of which you can generalize, and see at a glance that some great thing has happened. You have only to guess once or twice before you hit it. Here you have the anxiety.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"One cheek red and the other pale" is in a good many remedies, but the anxious expression, and the fear, and the heat, and the restlessness, and the suddenness with which it comes on in a plethoric individual- yesterday it was very dry and windy-and you will at once place this one symptom with Aconite. But it might be one of several other remedies, were other conditions present. "Neuralgic pains in the face, like hot wires running along either side of the face." The individual rides in the cold, raw wind, and his face was exposed to the cold wind. He becomes numb, then pain sets in, intense pain. He cries out and shrieks with the knife-like cutting pains. Aconite will relieve. "Crawling, creeping like ants"; Aconite has that sensation along the course of the nerves. It has a sensation like ice water poured along the course of the nerves. Sciatica when the sensation is felt down the nerve like ice water. "Creeping, tingling and crawling in the face, with or without pain." There is intense heat, intense fever in the face. The side of the face laid on will often break into a sweat, and if the patient turns over, that side will at once become dry, and the other side will at once break out in a sweat.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">TEETH</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Oh, what a comforting remedy it is for TOOTHACHE. It has been so useful in toothache that nearly every old lady nowadays knows enough to put a drop of Aconite on a bit of cotton and put it in the old hollow tooth. It will quite often palliate. A dose of Aconite will act much better. But the violence of the toothache; again the same old story, from the dry, cold winds, plethoric individuals, with hollow teeth, pain intense, cutting, shooting pains in the teeth. Sometimes these pains are in sound teeth and affect the whole row of teeth. Violent pains from exposure, such as riding in the wind. The pains are relieved and go away speedily after a dose of Aconite.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">MOUTH</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Disturbances of taste, disordered stomach. EVERYTHING TASTES BITTER, except water; and, oh, how the Aconite patient longs for water. It seems almost impossible for him to get water enough and it agrees well.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">BURNING is a symptom that runs all through the remedy, you will find it descriptive of all the pains. Burning in the head, burning along the course of nerves, burning in the spine, burning in fever, sometimes burning as if covered with pepper.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">THROAT</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Aconite is a very useful medicine in inflammation of the THROAT, when there is burning, smarting, dryness, great redness of the tonsils, or the fauces, the whole throat. Sometimes the soft palate is greatly swollen. A high grade of inflammation, acute inflammation of all that can be seen and called throat. But that alone would not indicate Aconite. It cures that kind of case, it cures inflammation of the throat, but every homeopathic physician knows that forty or fifty remedies could be selected just as well as Aconite from all that I have said. I have only mentioned a nondescript case. No homeopathic physician could prescribe upon that kind of evidence. But you note the kind of throat - every physician must ask himself the question: "What would make that kind of a throat an Aconite case?" And then the question would come up, could he not prescribe for it as well if he had not seen the throat? The throat does not do much towards representing, to an INTELLIGENT PHYSICIAN, the patient. If it was necessary to represent to the mind of the physician the inflamed part itself, how would he treat the liver? He cannot see it. How would he prescribe for the stomach? He cannot see it. We are then compelled to fall back upon that which represents to the intelligent physician the very nature of the patient himself, and then at once we will see the reason for some of these things. If you present the Aconite patient well before the mind you can prescribe. It would be well to see anything that is visible. If you could see the liver, I would say look at it. If you could see the heart, I would say examine it. What is it in this throat that really represents the patient? Of course, any soreness of the throat makes it difficult to swallow. I mean to infer that there is nothing in the soreness to represent to the physician the Aconite patient. If that individual were a plethoric individual, if he had been riding in a cold, raw wind a good part of the day, and he had wakened in the night with a violent burning, tearing sore throat, and he could not swallow, and the fever came on high, and he had thirst for cold water and he could not get enough of it, he was in AN ANXIOUS, FEVERISH STATE, you have then a PATIENT to prescribe for. Many times will patients become intelligent enough under your observation to write just what some member of the family acts like. You know just what the patient looks like. The black man will sometimes give the best kind of a description, better than the Vassar girl, who writes us: "Doctor, will you please send the medicine; I have looked into the throat and it is red."</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOMACH</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">With the stomach symptoms, what an anxious patient we have! The pains are dreadful. Burning pains, tearing pains, with anxiety, with restlessness, with fever, coming on from taking cold-not from overeating, but from taking cold, which has settled in the stomach, from exposure to an ice bath, or in a very hot summer from intense heat, associated with an irritable brain in vigorous children. Vomiting and retching, fearing, as it were, the very inside out by the awful retching. The vomiting of blood, bright red blood. This is descriptive of the general stomach trouble. During this febrile state, he craves bitter things, wine and beer, and brandy, but they will come up as soon as they reach the stomach. He craves pungent things, nothing tastes bitter enough. "If he could only get something bitter." And yet his food tastes bitter, everything he eats tastes bitter, everything except water. The word in the text is a clinical word; it says "gastric catarrhs." It is a very sharp, acute inflammation of the stomach. Retching, vomiting, of bile, vomiting of blood. Ineffectual urging to vomit, when there is nothing in the stomach. With it, there will be ANXIETY, RESTLESSNESS, FEAR OF DEATH. The fear depicted upon the countenance makes an awful expression.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">ABDOMEN</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Aconite is a useful medicine in inflammation of the liver, when it comes suddenly. It is not very useful in repeated attacks, but in the first attack. Violent inflammation of the liver, with violent tearing pains and much burning. Then comes the restlessness, the awful TORTURES OF ANXIETY, MOVING CONSTANTLY, FEAR OF DEATH, RED FACE, GLASSY EYES, GREAT THIRST. "Anxious restlessness" covers nearly all of these things. In the abdomen, there are shooting pains, burning, stinging pains, after exposure to cold, becoming chilled. We will soon come to think that it does not make much difference where the disorder occurs, we must have the Aconite patient. We also have inflammatory troubles of all the viscera of the abdomen. It may be a violent catarrhal inflammation. It may be a catarrhal condition of the lower portion of the colon, or a catarrhal condition of the rectum, when we will have dysentery.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">STOOL</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">In dysentery, that which is found in the commode is almost pure blood, blood and a little slime. It seems impossible for him to leave the commode. Vomiting a little blood and passing bloody mucus from the rectum. Always they will predict they will die tonight, or in a few hours. They look as if they realized the sensation of death. The whole body is in a state of anguish, but the tenesmus and cramp, the urging to stool are simply terrible. It has a watery diarrhoea, but that is not a very important symptom, although it is doubly marked in Herring. But when pure blood is passed, and mucus, with tenesmus, or when a little green mucus is passed by infants with summer troubles, pure blood or grass-green discharges with fever coming on suddenly, in bright, rosy little ones, think of Aconite. Most of the bowel troubles come on from intense heat, in the children. The infant takes on inflammation of the liver from the heat, and the stool becomes white like milk, of putty consistency. The child becomes yellow and screams with pain.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">BLADDER-KIDNEYS</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">It is useful in urinary troubles, bladder and kidney troubles. Inflammatory conditions, and with bloody urine. Scanty urine, suppressed urine, or retained urine. Retention from shock. This retention from shock makes it one of our best remedies for retention in the newborn. The infant just born into the world has undergone a shock. At your next visit the nurse says, "The child has not passed urine." The functions of that little one are not yet established, because of the great shock the little one has gone through. Inflammation of the bladder, with cutting, tearing pains. Burning pains with burning urine. Urine is hot, dark, colored red; red and clear, or bloody. Retention from cold, especially in children, with crying and restlessness. With inflammatory conditions of the bladder, either in adults or in infants, there will be all the mental states representing the Aconite patient.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-MALE</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Aconite cures most violent cases of orchitis, which come on suddenly. Orchitis from cold, from being chilled, in plethoric men. But in the common orchitis from suppressed gonorrhoeal discharges, Aconite is useless.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">GENITALIA-FEMALE</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The woman is a natural Aconite patient, with her sympathetic natural sensitiveness. She usually takes on complaints from nervous shock, from fear, and she naturally takes on complaints from causes other than those from which men take on sickness. It is very seldom that fear will give a man inflammation, but fear is a common cause of inflammation of the uterus, and of the ovaries, in plethoric, vigorous, excitable women. Fear will often cause abortion, but when Aconite is given early enough it will check the abortion that comes from fear. We will have the stitching, burning, tearing pains of Aconite sometimes following fear or sudden emotion. Sometimes a pregnant woman will say, "Doctor, there is no use your planning for my confinement. I know I am going to die in that confinement." If there is, any one thing that is a really strong symptom to prescribe on it is that. A dose of Aconite, and then change the subject, she goes away, and in a few days, you ask her about that fear and she says, "Oh, never mind that." Many little things like that can be singled out. But that state of fear is a very peculiar thing, and really represents the whole nature and being of the woman. She predicts the day of her death. The reason that Aconite is so often the infant's remedy is because the infant is so often made sick from fright. "Inflammation of the genitals in plethoric women." Aconite is more frequently indicated in women and children than in men. Sensitive, vigorous, excitable women. It is indicated in men in inflammatory conditions from becoming chilled in dry, cold air, and it is wonderful how you can convince a patient who needs Aconite what wonderful things there are in Homeopathy by showing him how rapidly, with Aconite, you can put him in a sweat and break up a sharp fever when that is a recent and single attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"After tedious and difficult parturition. Violent after-pains. Shooting, tearing after-pains, with febrile conditions." Uterine haemorrhagia with bright red blood and fear of death. It is wonderful what Aconite will do in some cases arising from taking cold in the puerperal state, but do not mix that up with puerperal fever. The first is a simple form, non-septic; perhaps the breast is involved, with soreness in the breast, suppression of the milk and febrile conditions; but if there is suppression of the lochia do not give Aconite.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Newborn children, with difficulty of breathing, after the use of forceps, or from a tedious labor; the child is breathless, there is difficulty with the heart, and in a few hours fever comes on. Aconite is a very simple remedy. The retention of urine in the infant is so commonly an Aconite condition that you will hardly ever need to use any other medicine. The little one cannot yet talk, it cannot manifest very much, and, to a certain extent, the practitioner is compelled to be somewhat routine in these affairs, and the routine practitioners have been more or less successful with Aconite for the retention of the urine. Again, it is true that in many cases of retention of the urine in the mother, it will disappear after a dose of Caust.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">COUGH</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Aconite is a great routine croup remedy, one that is misused; but it is indicated in all those cases of croup which come on suddenly in plethoric children, from exposure to dry, cold wind, having been out in the cold wind with the mother during the day. The child is put to bed and rouses up from the first sleep, perhaps at 9, 10, or 11 o'clock, grasps the throat, coughs violently, a croupy, choking cough, with hoarse bark. Hardly any other remedy can correspond to that rapidity of action, taking cold in the daytime and developing itself so suddenly. Croup that comes on from exposure today, and does not develop until tomorrow morning or tomorrow evening, may correspond to quite a number of other remedies, but especially Hep., which is slower in its pace. And it is more suitable in children somewhat run down and subject to frequent attacks of croup. Spong. is also similar, but it lacks many of the elements more likely to occur in run-down children, those always taking cold. It would be a difficult matter to distinguish between the appearance of the Aconite and the Spong</span><span class="csA62DFD6A">.</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> croup so far as the croup is concerned, because both have all the anxious appearance found in croup. The Aconite croup is a violent croup, inflammation of the larynx, and, at the same time, spasms of the larynx, coming on with great rapidity. The Spong</span><span class="csA62DFD6A">.</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> croup is less inflammatory, the inflammation grows with the spasms; but while Spong</span><span class="csA62DFD6A">.</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> may rouse up at 11 o'clock at night, suffocating and choking, it has not the intense febrile excitement that belongs to Aconite, nor the anguish, although it has all the dryness that is found in Aconite. Aconite conditions are dry as a usual thing, or there is only a little watery discharge. Spong. is entirely dry; if there is an inflamed mucous membrane, it is dry. We have in the croup symptoms in Aconite: Larynx sensitive to touch. "Croup, waking in first sleep, after exposure to dry, cold winds."</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">RESPIRATION</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Aconite is full of disturbances of respiration, dyspnoea from contraction of the smaller bronchial tubes, which we find resembles asthma. It is indicated in that dyspnoea that belongs to capillary bronchitis, in that dyspnoea that belongs to cardiac excitement in plethoric persons, from taking cold, becoming exposed or from shock. Dyspnoea from fear, such as occurs in nervous women, excitable, easily affected, nervous, plethoric women. Breathing short, labored, anxious, quick. It is an asthmatic dyspnoea and there is usually dryness of the mucous membranes of the small bronchial tubes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sits up straight and can hardly breathe." Aconite has such a sudden violent cardiac irritation, pulse fluttering, weak, full and bounding; sits up in bed, grasps the throat, wants everything thrown off; before midnight, a hot skin, great thirst, great fear-everything is associated together. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Anguish with dyspnoea. Sudden attacks of pain in the heart, with dyspnoea." All go together. "Great suffocation." From this fear and from anxiety he breaks out in profuse sweat; he is drenched with sweat-and yet his skin is hot. When this anxiety passes off, he becomes hot. So there is heat and sweat with this awful anxiety. Pulse like a thread.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">CHEST</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Better during expiration." The spasm of the larynx often comes on during inspiration. "Worse during inspiration. Constant short, dry cough. Difficult breathing. Breathes only with the diaphragm. Chest troubles, such as pneumonia." Aconite produces a very rapid inflammation of the viscera of the chest, of the pleura, of the lungs, of the mucous membrane lining the air passages. In pneumonia, we have this dyspnoea, the suddenness with which it comes on. If it spreads rapidly, it may go into pneumonia. Inflammation runs so high that the mucous membrane oozes blood, cherry red, or the mucus that comes up is white and heavily streaked with bright red blood. You go to the bedside of broncho-pneumonia and you will find in the pan mucus streaked with bright red blood. Now, take the violence with which that comes on, the restlessness and anxiety of the individual- he predicts the hour of his death - that would be the case with the Aconite patient. In the case of pneumonia where the lung is involved, it is likely to be the upper half of the left lung when Aconite is indicated. Sometimes the whole mucous membrane, the visible throat, the larynx, trachea, the bronchial tubes, will all ooze blood, sometimes a mouthful of blood, so violent is the inflammation. In these chest troubles, there is much pain. Shooting, burning, tearing pains and the patient is compelled to lie in a somewhat elevated position, on the back. Cannot lie upon either side, but upon the back. Lying on the side increases the pain. The dry cold winds. Sudden shocks, in persons of good, strong, vigorous circulation. The haemoptysis that is spoken of is not such as occurs in phthisis, but is involuntary; the blood comes up with a slight cough. Some one might be deceived to give it in such cases in broken down constitutions in sickly patients; but it is not to be administered in such cases, we have much better remedies. The patient does not always become a pneumonia patient, but inflammation of the small air passages may be all that is present.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EXPECTORATION</span></p><p class="csC583D0C8"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Dry cough, vomiting and retching, intense fever, spitting of blood." No expectoration except a little watery mucus and blood. It occurs a good deal in this way. Dry cough, sensation of dryness of the whole chest, sensation of dryness in the larynx and throat. Pours down great quantities of cold water, and once in a while after a violent coughing spell he gets up a little blood. But the expectoration is generally mucus. Pneumonia is generally attended with an expectoration looking like iron rust, as if iron rust had been mixed in with it. Such medicines as Bry. and Rhus-t. and a few others have that expectoration as a common feature, as natural to the remedies themselves, but Aconite is THE CHERRY RED, BRIGHT RED expectoration. Its haemorrhages ARE BRIGHT RED, AND SOMETIMES COPIOUS.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">All these coughs in pneumonia, in croup, and chest troubles come on suddenly, and if he goes to sleep, he will have spasm of the larynx, with dryness of the larynx. He goes to sleep and the larynx becomes dry, and he wakes up and grasps his larynx; he thinks he is going to choke. All these come on from cold winds. Vigorous persons get into a draft and get a chill that will bring on Aconite symptoms.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Aconite has in all inflamed parts a sensation as if hot steam were pushing into the parts, as if warm blood were rushing into the parts, or "flushes of heat in the parts." Along nerves, a sensation of heat, or sensation of cold.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">The pulse in the highest form of the fever is full and bounding; strong, vigorous pulse. When the attack is first coming on and the awful anxiety and nerve tension are present the pulse is very small, but after the heart's action is well established, then the pulse becomes stronger.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">BACK</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Tearing pains down the spine. Painful, stiff neck. Crawling in the spine like insects." That is a peculiar feature, this crawling sensation; it comes from cold, from being suddenly chilled.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs243F98C">EXTREMITIES</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Trembling of the hands" associated with these sudden acute attacks. "Creeping pains in the fingers" associated with these sudden acute inflammatory attacks. "Cold as ice. Feet cold as ice. Hot palms." Hot hands and cold feet are sometimes present. Rheumatic conditions of the joints. Those that come on as a first attack. Not old rheumatic and gouty attacks, but those that come on as acute rheumatism, those that come on from sudden exposure to cold, from long rides in a dry, cold wind. They also are attended with fever, with anxious restlessness, with a critical state of mind so often described.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">"Trembling, tingling, convulsions of the muscles." But the NERVES are full of Aconite symptoms and Aconite sufferings. Aconite is a wonderful remedy for neuritis in plethoric persons. Numbness along the course of the nerves, from cold, from exposure. Numbness and tingling, along the course of the nerves, especially those that run close to the surface. "Inflammation of the nerve sheaths. Nervous excitability. Excessive restlessness."</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">Sulph. has a strong relation to Aconite. It has many Aconite symptoms. In many of the old chronic cases where. Sulph. would be used in strong, vigorous constitutions Aconite will be suitable for a sudden attack, and Sulph</span><span class="csA62DFD6A">.</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> for the chronic. In sudden attacks that Aconite conforms to, that is the whole attack, there may be left in that constitution a tendency to return of a similar attack. Aconite has no power over that tendency, but Sulph. has. Of course, most of the symptoms must agree, but it will seem to you frequently where Aconite has been suitable in the acute disease that Sulph</span><span class="csA62DFD6A">.</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> symptoms will follow, and many times a very violent attack leaves a weakness in the constitution which Aconite has no power to contend with. It has no power to keep off recurrent attacks. It does all that it is capable of doing, and that is the end of it. But it is not so with Sulph.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">After Aconite follow well ARNICA and BELLADONNA. Sometimes it is true it will appear to you that Aconite is capable of coping with all there is in the disease. But there seems to be a lingering something that holds on, and such medicines as Arn</span><span class="csA62DFD6A">.</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> and Bell</span><span class="csA62DFD6A">.,</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> and Ip. and Bry., do have to come in to finish up the attack-or sometimes SULPHUR. Very commonly SILICA. So we have to study the relations of medicines.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">If you have administered Aconite in too many doses, or given it too strong, and your patient is slow in recovering from the attack, or your patient has taken Aconite himself unwisely, then COFFEA or NUX-V. will often put the patient into a better condition.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs5EFED22F">&nbsp;</span></p></span>
