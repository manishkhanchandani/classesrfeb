      <h1>Defense Mechanism of Body</h1>
      <p>Every organism possesses a defense mechanism which is constantly coping with stimuli from both internal and external sources. This defense mechanism is responsible for maintaining a state of equilibrium in body. The defense mechanism is constantly trying to create and maintain the balance in body, but it is not always completely successful. If defense mechanism were always functioning perfectly, there would never be any suffering, symptoms, diseases.</p>
