      <p><strong>What is Asthma?</strong><br>
        A condition in which a person's airways become inflamed, narrow and
swell, and produce extra mucus, which makes it difficult to breathe.</p>
      <p><strong>Common Facts:</strong><br>
      Asthma can be minor or it can interfere with daily activities. In some cases, it may lead to a life-threatening attack. </p>
      <p>Asthma may cause difficulty breathing, chest pain, cough, and wheezing. The symptoms may sometimes flare-up. </p>
      <p>Asthma can usually be managed with rescue inhalers to treat symptoms (albuterol) and controller inhalers that prevent symptoms (steroids). Severe cases may require longer-acting inhalers that keep the airways open (formoterol, salmeterol, tiotropium), as well as oral steroids.</p>
      <p><strong>Very common </strong></p>
      <p>More than 3 million US cases per year </p>
