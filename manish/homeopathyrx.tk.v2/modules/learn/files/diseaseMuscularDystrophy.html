      <p><strong>What is Muscular Dystrophy?</strong><br>
      A group of genetic diseases that cause progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass.</p>
      <p><strong>Common Facts:</strong><br>
      In muscular dystrophies, abnormal genes (mutations) lead to muscle degeneration. Most forms begin in childhood. </p>
      <p>Damaged muscles become progressively weaker. Most people who have the condition eventually need a wheelchair. Other symptoms include trouble breathing or swallowing. </p>
      <p>Medications, therapy, breathing aids, or surgery may help maintain function, but life span is often shortened.</p>
      <p><strong>Rare</strong></p>
      <p>Fewer than 200,000 US cases per year</p>

      <strong>Pain areas:</strong> in the muscles </p>
      <p><strong>Muscular:</strong> abnormality walking, flaccid muscles, muscle weakness, loss of muscle, or permanent shortening of muscle </p>
      <p><strong>Developmental:</strong> delayed development or learning disability </p>
      <p><strong>Also common:</strong> cardiomyopathy, constantly walking on tip toe, constipation, difficulty swallowing, fatigue, scoliosis, or shallow breathing</p>

        <p><strong>Self Care:</strong><br>
        <strong>Physical exercise: </strong>Aerobic activity for 20-30 minutes 5 days a week improves cardiovascular heatlh. If injured, pursuing an activity that avoids the injured muscle group or joint can help maintain physical function while recovering.        </p>
