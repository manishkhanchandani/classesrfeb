      <h1>How does Homeopathy cures Disease?</h1>
      <p>
Homeopathy cures disease by creating similar symptoms in patient's body. Because we know defense mechanism creates symptoms to cure the disease.</p>
      <p>So cure can only bring by increasing similar symptoms in patient's body. </p>
      <p>In reality homeopathy never cures a disease, it only increases symptoms, rest all is done by symptoms. Because defense mechanism of body works with the help of symptoms so it only needs symptoms to cure the disease. </p>
      <p>In aphorism 19 hahnemann has mentioned: &quot;it is very evident that medicines could never cure disease if they did not possess the power of altering manâ€™s state of health&quot;</p>
