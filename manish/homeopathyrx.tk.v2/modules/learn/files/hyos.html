      <h1>HYOSCYAMUS NIGER (Hyos.)</h1>
      <p>1. JEALOUSY, 2. SUSPICIOUSNESS, 3. TOUCHING GENITALS, 4. SHAMELESSNESS</p>
      <p><strong>1. Jealousy</strong><br>
      Hyoscyamus has jealousy, envy. This jealousy is not simple. The patient has a desire to attack and kill in a cold and calculating way.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Suspiciousness</strong><br>
      They can become paranoid that other people are plotting to harm them.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Touching Genitals</strong><br>
      The sexuality is perverted, they touch their genitals all the time (esp. children) and  they masturbate quite a lot. </p>
      <p><strong>4. Shamelessness</strong><br>
      Another perversion is that they like to talk about feces or even play with them. The shameless is characteristic. We see a tendency to expose their nudity. They are going around the house naked, they leave the toilet door open, or they can become exhibitionists. </p>
