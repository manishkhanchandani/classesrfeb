      <h1>Levels of Diseases & Susceptible to Disease</h1>
      <p>Each Disease vibrates at one level for example (sample)</p>
      <p>Level A: Minor Problem, skin problem, Warts - Nail Infection, etc</p>
      <div>
        <p>Level B: Gonorrhea, Staphylococcal Infections, Urethritis, etc.</p>
        <p>Level C: Kidney Infection, colitis, etc.</p>
        <p>Level D: Tuberculosis, etc.</p>
        <p>Level E: Lupus Rheumatoid Arthritis, etc.</p>
        <p>Level F: some disease</p>
        <p>Level G: some disease</p>
        <p>.....</p>
        <p>Level M: Multiple Sclerosis etc.</p>
        <p>Level N: Myasthenia Gravis, etc.</p>
        <p>.....</p>
        <p>Level Z: Endogenous suicidal depression, Schizophrenia, etc.</p>
        <p>Above is just example, for learning purpose.</p>
        <p>So from above example, you can see there are different level of diseases and each set of disease vibrate at particular level.</p>
        <p>Now if a patient's vibration level matches with level A, he can suffer from any of the disease which are in level A, he will be susceptible to diseases of level A. He will not get disease of level B no matter what happens. He can only suffer from a set of disease on level A.</p>
        <p>Similarly if a person is at vibration level C, he can suffer from only those disease which are at level C, he will not suffer from any disease at level B and nor at level D, he can only suffer from set of diseases at level C.</p>
        <p>This is called susceptible to disease.</p>
        <p>So when you treat with homeopathy, patient will move from higher level to lower level and in the end he will reach level A which is the healthiest level. And if you treat patient with allopathy, he will move from lower level to higher level and he will ultimately reach to level Z (in reality not all people reach here)</p>
        <p>This diagram is example. But patient with schizophrenia rarely gets physical problems.</p>
        <p>Each individual is at a particular level and they are susceptible to only particular set of diseases. And when their level changes then they r susceptible to another set of diseases.</p>
        <p>So we need to change level of patients to more healthier level and goal is to reach level A</p>
        <p>Patient with level z cannot reach to level A easily. He may jump to level T then level M may be and gradually to level A</p>
        <p>So hering created similar concept in his laws that is diseases move outward. Disease move from more important to less important organ when correct remedy is prescribed</p>
        <p>Hahnemann also created similar concept with miasms like psora as level and sycosis and syphilis as another levels. But in reality we have many miasms which are shown here as levels. Each miasm can also be called as susceptible to particular set of diseases.</p>
        <p>Hahnemann also said when u have stronger disease then weaker disease never attack u,</p>
        <p>I here showed levels from A to Z but in reality it may be more infinite sets of levels.</p>
        <p>Each level with particular set of diseases</p>
