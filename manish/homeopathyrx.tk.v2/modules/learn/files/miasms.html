      <h1>Concept of Miasm in real sense?</h1>
      <p>We can call it as PREDISPOSITION TO DISEASE. </p>
      <p>Let's say a person is suffering from certain sets of diseases like disease A, or disease B or disease C, that means he is susceptible to those diseases. He can either get disease A or disease B or disease C or all of them. I can say he is suffering from &quot;Miasm X&quot; which has certain symptoms or this Miasm X can have certain diseases only.</p>
      <p>There is another person with different sets of diseases like disease X, disease Y, disease Z, that means he is susceptible to those diseases. He can get either disease X, or Y or Z, or all of them. I can say he is suffering from &quot;Miasm Y&quot; which has certain symptoms or this miasm Y can have certain diseases.</p>
      <p>and this way there are n number of miasms. Though hahnemann was able to differentiate it between Psora, Syphilis or Sycosis. But in reality there can be n number of miasms.</p>
      <p>Miasms is nothing but predisposition to disease. It mean that i can suffer from only certain sets of diseases.</p>
      <p>In other words I can change the name of miasm to levels. So each level has certain number of similar diseases which a person can suffer.</p>
      <p>So hahnemann said that miasms are the cause of diseases, in other words we can call it as predisposition to diseases.</p>
      <p>It is only a concept that person will suffer from certain sets of diseases.</p>
      <p>But to find a remedy, we only need to match the symptoms of patient with the symptoms of the remedy and nothing more.</p>
