      <h1>NITRICUM ACIDUM (Nit-ac.)</h1>
      <p>The Nit-ac. patient is miserable, in a state of constant dissatisfaction. They are never pleased by anything. They become nihilistic to the point that life is meaningless.</p>
      <p>The characteristic on the physical level is the sluggish circulation, the splinter-like pains and the offensiveness of the discharges.</p>
      <p align="center"><strong>Essence: </strong><br>
      MISERABLE, ANXIOUS WITH STITCHING PAINS AND OFFENSIVE DISCHARGES</p>
      <p><strong>Mind:</strong><br>ANXIETY ABOUT HEALTH.

        <br>
        Fear of impending disease, cancer, death. Hypochondriacal anxiety.

 

        <br>
      Unforgiving, bears a grudge. Unmoved by apologies. </p>
      <p><strong>Physical:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Splinter Like Pain:</strong><br>
        <span class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csB86C8CFE">STITCHING, SPLINTER-LIKE PAINS.</span><span class="cs5EFED22F"> Their special seat of action is where mucous membranes and skin meet.</span></span>      </p>
      <p><strong>Offensive Discharges:</strong><br>
        OFFENSIVE DISCHARGES. URINE SMELLS LIKE HORSE’S URINE. <br>
        Offensive perspiration. <br>
      Excoriating perspiration of feet that destroy the socks.</p>
      <p><strong>MODALITIES

      <p><strong>Dissatisfaction:</strong><br>
        It is difficult to find a single word that encompasses the Nitric acid patient, but if I were to choose one it would be, &quot;pests&quot;, the effect the Nitric acid patient has on others due to the constant internal state of DISSATISFACTION; these patients are always dissatisfied and miserable. They are never pleased, even under the most joyful circumstances. In this way they reach a state where they are considered unfit for company by others; they are not at all enjoyable to be with and this is why others call them &quot;pests&quot;.      </p>
      <p><strong>Sluggishness:</strong><br>
      The most prominent aspect of the physical pathology is a SLUGGISHNESS of the circulation. This underlies many of the elements in the Nitric acid picture. It is responsible for the extreme weakness seen in Nitirc acid, as well as the marked chilliness. It also causes indolent ulcers which keep on oozing and spreading: Another characterisitic of Nitric acid is the fissures found at the junctions of skin and mucous membranes. These can be attributed to dryness in these areas which causes the skin to crack easily. Physiologically, this dryness can be explained by the sluggish circulation.</p>
      <p><strong>Offensive:</strong><br>
      It seems that the kidneys and other internal organs of elimination do not function efficently in Nitric acid, and therefore a lot of waste products must be eliminated through the skin-generally through discharges. That is why the Nitric acid patient is an OFFENSIVE patient in general. There is very offensive perspiration of the feet. Even the urine smells like that of a horse. Discahrges are offensive, acrid, corrosive, and very imitating to the patient.</p>
