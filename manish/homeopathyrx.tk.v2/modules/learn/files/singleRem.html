      <h1>Single remedy / Single Dose</h1>
      <p>
Every perceptible progressive and strikingly increasing amelioration in a transient (acute) or persistent (chronic) disease, is a condition which, as long as it lasts, completely precludes every repetition of the administration of any medicine whatsoever, because all the good the medicine taken continues to effect is now hastening toward its completion.<br><br>
Every new dose of any medicine whatsoever, even of the one last administered, that has hitherto shown itself to be salutary, would in this case disturb the work of amelioration."
This is explained "In the aphorisms 245, 246 and 247 of the 5th Organon"
Anytime there is a "strikingly increasing amelioration" on a dose of a homoeopathic remedy there is no need for the repetition of the remedy. If the remedy is repeated when it is not needed it will only slow the cure or disrupt the case.</p>
