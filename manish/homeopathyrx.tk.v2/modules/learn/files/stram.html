      <h1>STRAMONIUM (Stram.)</h1>
      <p>1. AGGRESSIVENESS, 2. VIOLENCE, 3. FEARS</p>
      <p><strong>1. Aggressiveness</strong><br>
      Their physical symptoms are also aggressive. Their convulsions are aggressive, their stammering is aggressive, the grimaces (an ugly, twisted expression) are aggressive.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Violence</strong><br>
      In Stramonium the words to remember are aggressiveness and violence. They can become so violent as to kill.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Fears</strong><br>
      There is a dark element in these patients and it's interesting here to mention the extreme fear of darkness. They have fear of tunnels, of closed or narrow places, of water, of shining surfaces.
These patients (esp. the children) can get into a Stramonium state after a frightening experience. They get terrible nightmares where they wake up in terror, with eyes wide open, but not recognizing anyone. They need some time to get out of the nightmare and come to their senses.</p>
