      <h1>Why Vaccinations Are Not Advisable in Homeopathy?</h1>
      <p>Why Vaccinations are not advisable?</p>
      <p>Let's consider disease X, and let's say there is a patient, now whether vaccination is required for this disease or not?</p>
      <p>We will discuss three case:<br>
        Case 1: Level of patient is lower than the level of disease X.<br>
        Case 2: Level of patient is greater than level of disease X.<br>
        Case 3: Level of patient is same as level of disease X.</p>
      <p>Case 1: Level of patient is lower than the level of disease X.</p>
      <p>If level of patient is lower than level of disease X, he will not get that disease X, not matter even if he is exposed that virus or bacteria. And vaccination will not do any harm to patient.</p>
      <p>Case 2: Level of patient is greater than level of disease X.</p>
      <p>If level of patient is greater than level of disease X, he will not get that disease X, not matter even if he is exposed that virus or bacteria. And vaccination will not do any harm to patient.</p>
      <p>Case 3: Level of patient is same as level of disease X,</p>
      <p>Here patient will be susceptible to the disease, now what will happen if you give vaccination and what will happen if you don't give vaccination to this patient.</p>
      <p>Case 3a: If you give vaccination such patients, vaccination will create strong reaction in body and make patient in more bad state that he was present normally. This is worst case and patient suffers for whole life because of vaccination. Though original disease is prevented with vaccination, but grave changes would have happened in his body which is more harmful.</p>
      <p>Case 3b: If you don't give vaccination to such patient then there are 2 possibilities.</p>
      <p>Case 3b - I: Patient does not comes in contact with related bacteria or virus?<br>
        If patient does not come in contact with bacteria or virus, he will not suffer from the disease and he will not have any problem.</p>
      <p>Case 3b: II: Patient comes in contact with related bacteria or virus?<br>
        If patient comes in contact with related bacteria or virus, then will get that disease, but with proper care and avoiding allopathic medicine will cure him soon as allopathic anti pyretic drug prevents real treatment of the disease. Homeopathic treatment works best in this case. </p>
      <p>So vaccinations are wrong medically.</p>
