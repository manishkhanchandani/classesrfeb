  <h1>History of Homeopathy</h1>
  
  <p>The history of homeopathy begins with the discoveries of its founder Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), a German physician. Hahnemann first coined the word "homeopathy" ("homoios" in Greek means similar, "pathos" means suffering) to refer to the pharmacological principle, the law of similars, that is its basis.</p>
  <p>Homeopathy ( i/ˌhoʊmiˈɒpəθi/) is a system of alternative medicine created in 1796 by Samuel Hahnemann, based on his doctrine of like cures like (similia similibus curentur), a claim that a substance that causes the symptoms of a disease in healthy people would cure similar symptoms in sick people.</p>
  <p>Hahnemann's first comments about the general applicability of the law of similars were in 1789 when he translated a book by William Cullen, one of the leading physicians of the era. At one point in the book Cullen ascribed the usefulness of Peruvian bark (Cinchona) in treating malaria due to its bitter and astringent properties. Hahnemann wrote a bold footnote in his translation, disputing Cullen's explanation. Hahnemann asserted that the efficacy of Peruvian bark must be for other factor, since he noted that there were other substances and mixtures of substances decidedly more bitter and more astringent than Peruvian bark that were not effective in treating malaria. He then described his own taking repeated doses of this herb until his body responded to its toxic dose with fever, chills, and other symptoms similar to malaria. Hahnemann concluded that the reason this herb was beneficial was because it caused symptoms similar to those of the disease it was treating. </p>

        <h2 class="page-header">Four Fundamental Laws of Homeopathy</h2>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></i> Law of Similars <p>The concept, however, was known long before. As early as Hippocrates and the Oracle at Delphi, the theory of "what a substance can cause so can it cure" was discussed.</p><p>It was Hahnemann who, through the process he called "proving," started paying close attention and taking notes on the reactions a healthy person, namely himself, would have in response to a given substance. For example, the symptoms he developed after drinking cinchona bark extract were similar to the symptom picture for malaria. The treatment for malaria is quinine, a product from cinchona bark. Hahnemann drew the conclusion that if cinchona bark can cause the symptoms, it should be able to resolve them too.</p></li>
          <li><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></i> Law is Single Remedy<p>Hahnemann believed that a practitioner should not prescribe more than one remedy at a time. There is a lot of wisdom in that thought.</p><p>Say one takes a multiple remedy product. If it doesn't work, too bad, try something else. But if it does work, how can the individual know which of the 5 or 6 or 12 ingredients in the product is the remedy that worked? And what are the chances that the remedy that was beneficial was the remedy to lead the individual to total healing?</p><p>To determine which single remedy best suits the needs of an individual, one must get a complete picture of one's state of being at that moment. </p></li>
          <li><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></i> Law of Minimum Dose<p>It states that one should take the smallest dose to nudge one's vital force to start the healing process. This conservative attitude allows a practitioner to ease the individual into the healing process.</p><p>Hahnemann believed that healing should be "rapid, gently and permanent."</p></li>
          <li><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></i> Direction of Cure<p>As a person works closer to health, an identifiable pattern of healing presents itself. First healing works its way down from head to foot. Second, healing
works from major organ to minor organ. Third, it moves from inside to outside. Finally, there is a reversal of symptoms.</p><p>The first three directions follow a logical path of down and out the body. The fourth direction is quite interesting in that as the newest ailments are resolved, older or previously suppressed symptoms reappear. For example, an old knee injury previously thought to be healed may resurface after a migraine's resolution (down direction and reversal of symptoms).</p></li>
          <li><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></i> These four fundamental laws - Similars, Single Remedy, Minimum Dose and Direction of Cure<p>These laws are the philosophical framework for homeopathy.</p></li>
