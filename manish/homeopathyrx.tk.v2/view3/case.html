 <p>If we are to make a successful prescription, we must know all the details of your sickness. We must
also understand all the features that belong to you as an individual. This includes your reactions to various
factors, your past and family history and your mental makeup. This information enables us to select the remedy
that removes your sickness. The medicine also makes you well as a whole person. In order find all about you,
we shall be asking you many questions. Each one of these questions has a definite meaning and significance for
us. There is not a single question that is useless. Even something that you may think is not connected with your
trouble may be the most important factor in deciding the correct homoeopathic medicine. That is why you must
be free and frank and give us the fullest possible information on each point. Please read each question carefully,
think, and if necessary, consult someone close to you and then answer completely. Do not keep anything back.
