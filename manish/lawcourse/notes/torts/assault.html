I. ASSAULT 

1	unlawful act
2	intentional
3	placing of another
4	in apprehension 
5	of imminent harmful or offensive contact (objective, ROPP)
6	with the apparent ability to carry it out

Assault is defined as the unlawful intentional placing of another in apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact, with the apparent ability to carry it out.

To be liable, D doesn’t need to have the actual ability, just apparent ability for such conduct.

Elements:
	
1.  A voluntary/affirmative act

1	Words alone are not sufficient.  Words must be coupled with some conduct by the D.  

Example; Verbal threats immediately followed by reaching into his pocket may create apprehension which might not be reasonable absent the verbal threats or D’s past acts.

1	Physical act alone is sufficient
2	Also, words spoken by the D may negate his conduct or any reasonable apprehension stemming from it.

Example; B violently shakes his fists at A, and says “If you weren’t my friend I would punch you right now.”  B’s words are enough to undue any reasonable apprehension by A.

2.  Intent

1	Purpose/knowledge to cause harmful…OR
2	Substantial certainty that harmful…OR
3	Transferred intent applied across torts (especially between battery and assault) targets

3.  Imminent Apprehension

1	P must have been aware and must have perceived the D’s conduct 

P may not recover for her apprehension that someone else will be so touched.
P must have the belief that something undesirable is going to happen, and that they are at risk.  Fear is not a necessary element.

2	The apprehension must be imminent.  Threat of future harm is not sufficient.
3	Apprehension must be reasonable (ROPP)

4.  Causation

1	P must prove that the D’s voluntary act caused the P’s apprehension.

THE EXISTENCE OF AN ASSAULT DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE D HAD THE LEGAL RIGHT TO COMPEL P TO PERFORM THE ACT.

Hypos;
P is a burglar and breaks into D’s house. D says, “If you don’t leave, I’ll throw you out.”  There is no assault on P, since D has the legal right to force P to leave.

D threatens to shoot P and leaves the room for the stated purpose of getting his revolver.  NO ASSAULT                                                                   

A person across the room threatens to kiss you.  NO ASSAULT

A large boxer says to a small man, “I am going to punch your lights out.” ASSAULT
