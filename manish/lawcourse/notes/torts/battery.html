II. BATTERY

2	intentional
3	harmful or offensive touching – direct/or indirect
4	without justification or excuse

Battery is defined as an intentional harmful or offensive touching without justification or excuse.

Elements:

1.  An affirmative act.

  - Act must be voluntary.
  - Involuntary or unconscious acts do not qualify.

2.  Intent

  - Purpose/knowledge to cause harmful or offensive touching; OR
  - Substantial certainty that harmful or offensive touch will occur; OR

Example; D shoots at C, intending to miss him, but also intending to make him think that he would be hit.  D has the intent needed for battery.

1	Transferred intent applies


3.  Harmful or offensive touching

  - Objective standard. Would the ROPP find the touching harmful or offensive?

  - Extreme sensitivities of the individuals will not be considered unless the D knew of the sensitivities.

  - Actual awareness at the time of the touching is not necessary.

    Example; D kisses C, while she is asleep.  D has committed a battery.

  - Touching must be with the individual’s person (body) or any object which may be considered a natural extension of the individual’s body.  (Fisher v. Carrousel)

  - Harmful:  in that it causes pain or bodily damage
    Offensive: if it is damaging to a reasonable sense of dignity

    Example; D spits on P.  A battery has occurred because a ROPP of average sensitivity in P’s position would have her dignity offended.

  - Agent – D does not have to come in contact with the person, a ball can act as the agent for the battery.

  - Occurs without consent or justification (as in a boxing match)


4. Causation

  - P must prove the D’s voluntary act caused the harmful touching.

Hypo- blowing smoke into someone’s face of normal health is not a battery but a mental issue.

Hypo- If someone says “lookout there’s a snake!” and the victim fell off the cliff and injured himself.  It is a battery when he hits the ground, but if he only jumps around in fright but doesn’t fall to the ground, then no battery.
