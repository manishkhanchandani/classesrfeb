I.  CONSENT

Where a party consents to the intentional conduct of another, the former cannot later bring an action against the other person in intentional tort.  

D who has committed an intentional tort may prevent liability by proving that the P consented to the D’s conduct.

Consent must be knowing & voluntary.

I.  Express Consent – Consent is clearly expressed by the P

II. Implied 

  - Implied through P conduct;

  - ROPP standard; would a person in D’s position believe that the P consented.

  - Implied by law; where it is an emergency and there is no time to consent and a ROPP in the P’s position would have consented under the circumstances.

Scope of Consent:  D must stay within scope of consent.  It may be determined based on custom and circumstances of the case.

Consent is ineffective if obtained through fraud or if P is mistaken about a material fact and the D knows of the P’s mistake.  Consent to criminal acts is ineffective (majority).

Consent to criminal acts is effective even if it involves a breach of peace (minority).
