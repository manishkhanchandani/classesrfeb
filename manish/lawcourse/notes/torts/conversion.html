VII. CONVERSION
1	intentional 
2	substantial  interference with; or
3	control and dominion 
4	over one’s possessory interest
5	in chattel 
6	that requires payment for the full value of the chattel

Conversion is defined as the intentional substantial interference with, or control and dominion over one’s possessory interest in chattel that requires payment for the full value of the value.

Elements:

1.  Intent

  - Purpose/knowledge; OR
  - Substantial certainty
  - Mistake does not negate intent.

All that is required is that D intended to take possession of the property.  Mistake as to ownership is generally not a defense.

Example; D buys an old painting from an art dealer, and reasonably believes that the art dealer has good title.  In fact, the painting was stolen from P years before.  D keeps the painting in his house for 10 years.  D is liable for conversion, regardless of his honest mistake about title.

2. Actual damage is not required

Example; D steal’s P’s car, then seriously (though not irreparably) damages it in a collision.  D is liable for conversion, and will be required to pay P the full value of the car (though D gets to keep the car).

Factors to use in Proving Conversion – Different from Trespass to Chattel

1	Duration & dominion and control
2	Intent of the D
3	D’s good faith or bad faith
4	Extent of the resulting interference or duration of D’s dominion over the party
5	Extent of harm to the chattel; and
6	Inconvenience and expense to the owner

Ways to Convert Chattel

1	Stealing
2	Damaging
3	Using chattel (especially by a bailee)
4	Obtaining possession from a thief
5	Wrongfully selling chattel
6	Delivery of chattel to the wrong person
7	Refusing to return chattel to the rightful owner.
