III. DEFENSE OF OTHERS

A person may use reasonable force to protect others against imminent threat of harm.

The intervenor must use reasonable force.

Effect of Mistake:
1	Privilege only applies where the 3rd party himself would be allowed to use self-defense.  If the intervenor is mistaken, they may be liable in intentional torts even if the mistake was reasonable.(majority)

Example: Dan sees that Paul is about to knock Bill down. To prevent this, Dan runs over and pushes Paul away. Paul sues Dan for battery. Dan raises the defense of the defense of others - Dan was trying to prevent Paul from harming Bill. Unknown to Dan, however, Bill had just pulled a knife on Paul. Paul was acting in self-defence when he was about to knock Bill down. Hence, Paul had a privilege to harm Bill.
