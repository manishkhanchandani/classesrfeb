III. FALSE IMPRISONMENT 

2	intentional
3	restraint or confinement
4	through force or threat of force
5	which confines one to a bounded area
6	without justification or excuse
7	and the person is aware of it

False imprisonment is defined as the intentional restraint of another through mental or physical boundaries without legal justification and the person is aware of it.

Elements:

1.  Affirmative act or omission

  - Physical confinement: actual confinement or restriction of one’s physical mobility.
  - Confinement through taking of a person’s personal property without which they cannot leave (wallet).
  - Mental confinement:  fear of harm forces the individual to remain within the limited space
  - Failure to proved means of egress.

2.  Intent

1	Purpose/knowledge to confine; OR 

Example; D a shopkeeper, negligently locks the store while P, a customer, is in the bathroom.  This is not false imprisonment, since D did not intend to confine P.

2	Substantial certainty that act will cause confinement; OR
3	Transferred intent applies to torts or across targets.

3.  Limited Space

  - D’s act must confine P to a limited space with defined boundaries.
  - No FI when an individual is prevented from entering an area or a space (building) because they are not prevented from going anywhere else, so they have not been confined.

4.  Awareness	

  - P must be aware of their confinement at the time of the confinement.
  - Exception:  Some courts waive the awareness requirement if the P suffered physical injury during or as a result of confinement.

Children are excused from the awareness requirement, b/c of their age and maturity.
If unconscious at the time of FI, then you wake up and are aware, than FI.
	
5.  No Reasonable Means of Escape

  - If there is a reasonable means of escape and the P is aware of it at the time of confinement, NO FI.
  - If P’s escape is reasonable and P is injured in the process of escape, than the D can be liable for the injuries caused to P.

6.  P must be held against their free will & protest

  - Mere obligation to stay is not sufficient.
  - Submission to stay due to persuasion of another is not sufficient.

P must be restrained against his will & protest, b/c if you do not protest than you blow your case.  If P submits to persuasion, and accompanies D to clear up a situation without any implied threat of force, than no FI.

The longer the confinement, the greater the damages the P is entitled to.

Threats of future action are not enough.  There is no FI if the D threatens to call police and have P arrested unless he stays.

Hypo – If a person requests to be let off air plane because they were afraid and pilot refused.  No duty to release unless urgent circumstances exist.

Hypo – A person complains of chest pain on an airplane and dies and the person is required to sit next to the dead body until the flight landed.  Is this a tort?
You must weigh the benefit and risk.  Schedule interruptions, fuel is expensive, many other people to consider.  These are all factors that relay into answering the question of whether or not there is a tort.

Hypo – Passengers sitting on the tarmac in an airplane waiting for takeoff for 6-8 hrs.  False Imprisonment ?  It is a question of common sense.  How are the facts going to sit with the jury?  A pregnant woman wants to get off?  The airline claims, that they can’t let you off because we have a schedule to keep.  Where is the common sense?  What is the jury going to think?

** Shopkeeper’s Privilege**

  - A limited privilege whereby a shopkeeper has the opportunity to temporarily & reasonably detain a suspected violator.

  - May be by direct physical means, but also by threats or by the assertion of legal authority.

** Inaction**
  - An omission to carry out one’s duty to act thereby causing confinement is FI.


FALSE ARREST

False arrest is defined as the arrest and custody by a person who claims but does not have legal authority.

  - False arrest may lead to FI if other elements of the tort are satisfied.
  - No action if the person arrested actually committed the crime for which they are arrested.
