IV. INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS

1	intentional
2	or reckless infliction
3	of severe mental & emotional distress
4	through extreme & outrageous conduct

IIED is defined as the intentional or reckless infliction of severe mental and emotional distress through extreme and outrageous conduct.

Elements:

1. Extreme & Outrageous Conduct

  - Conduct must be go beyond all bounds of decency

Soliciting intercourse must be persistent & aggravated conduct that goes beyond all reasonable bounds tolerated by a civilized society.  One such illicit request for intercourse does not give rise to the action.

Persistent & intolerable conduct not generally acceptable to normal standards of decency requires no physical damage to P and therefore is sufficient.
	
  - Conduct must be extreme and outrageous based on a ROPP standard

Example; D threatens that if P, a garbage collector, does not pay over part of his proceeds to D and his henchman, D will severely beat P.  Since D’s conduct is extreme and outrageous, and since he has intended to cause P distress, D is liable for IIED.

Extremely outrageous conduct directed against 3rd parties, intentionally or with reckless disregard of the consequences, which causes emotional distress to P, may be enough if such distress is accompanied by bodily harm.

Example; As a practical joke D tells P that her husband has been badly injured in an accident, and is lying in the hospital with broken legs.  This conduct is sufficiently outrageous.

  - An individual’s sensitivities will not be taken into consideration unless the D is aware of them.

Known vulnerability of P’s age, sex, illness, pregnancy, etc., will be considered by the court.

  - Mere insults are not enough.


2. Intent

  1	Purpose/knowledge; OR
  2	Substantial certainty; OR
  3	Recklessness; OR

Example; D commits suicide, by slashing his throat in P’s kitchen.  D’s estate
is liable because D recklessly disregarded the high risk that distress would occur.

  - Transferred intent applies if;

Family can claim IIED, but they have to be present and actually witness the event, and the actor must be aware that the family is there.  Some jurisdictions require that the family member have suffered physical injury as well.

3. Emotional Distress must be Severe
	
  - P must show actual severe distress.  Most cases don’t require that the distress resulted in physical bodily harm.

P must show at least that her distress was severe enough that she sought medical aid.  

  - There has to be a causal connection between the conduct and the emotional distress.

TELEGRAPH OPERATORS, COMMON CARRIERS & INNKEEPERS (hotels) have a special obligation to the public and cannot insult their customers.  It is thought that they are in a captive situation.
