V.  RECOVERY OF CHATTEL

One may use reasonable force to recover chattel which has been unlawfully taken from them.

NEVER INCLUDES DEADLY FORCE FOR RECOVERY OF CHATTEL.

May be used when;
  - When the wrongdoer is in the process of taking the chattel; or
  - Shortly after wrongdoer has taken the property, and the rightful owner/possessor is in hot pursuit of the wrongdoer.


Shopkeeper’s Privilege
  - Merchants have the right to detain, for reasonable investigation, an individual whom they believe to have taken a chattel unlawfully.

Elements:  Reasonable belief that the detainee has taken the property; and reasonable time and manner of investigation.  If any of these elements are not fulfilled, the merchant may be liable for false imprisonment.


Example: David lets his friend, Paul, use David’s bike for a brief ride in the playground. When Paul is on the bike for a few moments, he decides not to return it and tells David this. David immediately pushes Paul off the bike and retrieves it. Paul sues David for battery. Paul wins. David cannot use the defense of recapture of chattels because Paul initially obtained possession of the bike rightfully.
