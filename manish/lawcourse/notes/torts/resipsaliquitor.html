VIII. RES IPSA LOQUITOR:

Rule: Res Ipsa Loquitur (RIL) means “the event or thing speak for itself”. It is a doctrine used by a plaintiff having trouble proving the defendant's breach of duty - the defendant's unreasonableness. RIL is an evidentiary tool designed to give the plaintiff a break in certain kinds of situations.

A. Generally:  -very cheap evidence, it is only used if nothing else will help you, normally the jury will not be impressed about it because they will be instructed that it is only of inferential value, and they can take it or leave it.  It will rarely be used to prove negligence.  

The doctrine res ipsa loquitor, “the thing speaks for itself” allows P to point to the fact of the accident, and to create an inference that, even without a precise showing of how D behaved, D was probably negligent.

Example:  A barrel of flour falls on P’s head as he walks below a window on the street.  At trial, P shows that the barrel fell out of a window of D’s shop, and that the barrels do not fall out of windows without some negligence.  D had exclusive control.  By use of the res ipsa loquitor doctrine, P has presented enough evidence to justify a jury verdict for him, so unless D comes up with rebuttal evidence that the barrel did not come from his shop or was not dropped by negligence, D will lose.

B. Requirements for:

Courts generally impose 4 requirements.

1	No direct evidence of D’s conduct:  There must be no direct evidence of how D behaved in connection with the event.

2	Seldom occurring without negligence:  P must demonstrate that the harm which occurred does not normally occur except through the negligence of someone.  P only has to prove most of the time negligence is the cause of such occurrences.

Example:  If an airplane crashes without explanation, P will generally be able to establish that airplanes usually do not crash without some negligence, thus meeting the requirement.

1	Exclusive control of defendant:  P must demonstrate that the instrumentality which caused the harm was at all times within the exclusive control of D.

Example:  P, while walking on the sidewalk next to D hotel, is hit by a falling arm chair.  Without more proof, P has not satisfied the “exclusive control” requirement, because a guest, rather than the hotel, may have had control of the chair at the moment it was dropped (Larson v. St. Francis Hotel).
	
 Multiple defendants – If there are two or more defendants, and P can show at least one of the defendants was in control, some cases allow P to recover (minority approach).  This is especially likely where all of the D participate together in an integrated relationship.

Example:  P is injured while on the operating table, and shows that either the surgeon, the attending physician, the hospital, or the anesthesiologist must have been at fault, but is unable to show which one.  P gets the benefit of res ipsa, and it is up to each individual defendant to exculpate himself (Ybarra v. Spangard).
Joint and Severable liability-when you have several people together they share responsibility but each defendant has the duty to present a defense.  

  - Not due to plaintiff:  P must establish that the accident was probably not due to his own conduct.

  - Evidence more available to D:  Some courts also require that evidence of what really happened be more available to D than to P.

Example:  This requirement is satisfied on the facts of Ybarra, supra, since the Ds obviously knew more than the unconscious patient about who was at fault.

1	Plaintiff was harmed.

C.  Effect of res ipsa:

It permits an inference that D was negligent, even though there is no direct evidence of negligence.  

It allows circumstantial evidence.  When res ipsa is used, P has met his burden of production, and is thus entitled to go to the jury.


D. Rebuttal evidence:

If D can merely show that he was in fact careful (in other words, shows general evidence of due care), this is not enough to give D a directed verdict, and the case will still go to the jury.

But if D’s evidence directly disproves one of the requirements for the doctrine, then D will get a directed verdict (assuming there is no prima facie case apart from res ipsa).	
In other words, the judge will decide the case (direct the case) without the facts going to the jury.

Example:  If D can show that the instrument that caused the harm was not within his control at all relevant times, the doctrine will not apply, and D may get a directed verdict.
