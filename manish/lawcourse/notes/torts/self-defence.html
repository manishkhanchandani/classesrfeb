II. SELF-DEFENSE

Every individual is privileged to use reasonable force to defend against threatened battery by another.

Good faith belief:  individual must reasonably believe that use of force is necessary.
A person may be wrong in their belief, as long as the belief was reasonable.
Threat of harm must be imminent:
1	Harm must be occurring or about to occur.
2	No self-defense allowed for harm which occurred in the past.
3	Once the aggressor has retreated and the threat of harm is no longer imminent, the privilege terminates.

Amount of force allowed:

  - Non-deadly force, no duty to retreat (majority)
  - Deadly force, requires retreat if the party can do so safely, unless the party is in her home.  
  - Reasonable force includes deadly force where it is reasonable to protect against that harm.

Provocations:  Verbal threats alone do not justify self-defense.  The provocations must be accompanied by threat of physical force.

Example:
Nathan sees Diana running towards him with a raised baseball bat. Thinking that she is going to hit him, Nathan throws a brick at Diana, breaking her leg. In fact, unknown to Nathan, Diana was simply expressing jubilation after just coming from a baseball game that her team won.
