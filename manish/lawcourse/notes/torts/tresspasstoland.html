V. TRESPASS TO LAND

1 unlawful 
2	intentional  (the intent is presumed, even if it was accidental)
3	entry of an individual or an object
4	on to land
5	of another
6	without permission

Trespass to land is defined as the unlawful intentional entry of an individual or an object on to land of another without permission.

Elements:

1.  Voluntary act.

  - Entry upon the land of another; or
  - Causing another individual or an object to enter the land of another

2.  Intent

  - Purpose/knowledge to enter upon the land; OR
  - Substantial certainty that one will enter upon the land
  - So long as one has the intent to enter upon the land of another.

3.  Damages

  - Does not require actual damages for physical entry.
  - Actual damages required in trespass by intangibles such as gases.
  - The entry must be unauthorized

If D remains on P’s land without the right to be there, even if she entered rightfully is a trespass.

When entry onto the land is just negligent, proof of actual damages is essential to the cause of action.

Scope of “Land”

  - Space above and below the land of which the possessor could make reasonable use.

Example; D, a pilot, loses control of the aircraft, and it lands on P’s property.  This is not trespass to land.

Example; D intentionally decides to land because of some reason or another, than it is a trespass and can also be charged with nuisance.

Particles and gasses: 
If D knowingly puts an object on P’s land without permission (or refuses to remove an object).  This includes particles and gases.  If D knowingly allows it to enter P’s property, this is a trespass.
Example; D’s factory spews pollutants onto P’s land.  This is a trespass.

Air space:
It can be a trespass for a plane to fly over P’s property if:  the plane enters into the immediate reaches of the airspace (below federally-prescribed minimum flight altitudes); and if the flight substantially interferes with P’s use and enjoyment of his land (by causing undue noise, vibrations, pollution).

- Hot air balloons landing in another’s property is not a trespass because they do not have control over where they land.  But if you intentionally decide to land because of some reason or another than that is a trespass and you can also charge nuisance.

- When government over-flights have substantially affected habitability of the land below, a court may find a “taking” within the meaning of the 5th A. to the constitution and the government will be required to compensate the owner.

Example; A recreational ranch owner sought compensation for “taking” based on noise from low over-flights by Air Force planes doing touch and go exercises at adjacent airstrip in remote West Texas.  The local government is subject to the same constitutional responsibility.

Underground:
It is also a trespass to mine under another’s land.  In many western state’s, however, the miner is permitted to follow the vein wherever it may lead, so long as it is unbroken.


Mistake is no defense to this tort.  Because land is very precious to the owner and the owner is entitled to the use (exclusive possession) and enjoyment (security to have the land unimpeded whether you are using it or not) of that land, unfettered by the unlawful trespass of another.  Usufruct is the right to have unfettered use of your property.

Hypo – A customer enters into a room that says “employees only” in a department store.  Trespass

Hypo – A customer opens sliding doors to look for a shirt of a different size.  In the process you tear your hand badly on a nail and bleed.  Are you a trespasser?  A trespasser is owed less care than an invitee and there may be no liability because you were a wrongdoer.

Hypo – Children playing in a garage and were told to stay away from the lighter fluid, but they played with it and started a fire.  The children became intentional tortfeasors when they did something that they were not permitted to do.
* A possible defense –“Attractive Nuisance”, because the lighter fluid was there and available to the children.
