Dealer operates an antique shop. While traveling, she buys a Union cavalry officer’s
handgun for $1,500 from Seller. Dealer takes several photos of the handgun and Seller
agrees to ship it to Dealer’s shop. When Dealer arrives home, she immediately shows
the photos of the handgun to Buyer. The parties shake hands on a deal to sell the
handgun to Buyer for $2,000, payment upon delivery.<br><br>
The next day, Buyer regrets agreeing to the deal without first having an opportunity to
actually examine the handgun. Buyer tells Dealer that he will not pay the $2,000 unless
she first allows him to have the handgun examined by an expert appraiser. Dealer
becomes angry and tells Buyer, “A deal’s a deal. I’ll expect my money when the
handgun is delivered to you.”<br><br>
When the handgun arrives at Dealer’s shop, she does some internet research and
discovers that the handgun was issued to a general who played a prominent role at the
Battle of Gettysburg, which increases the value of the handgun by a factor of ten. The
next day, Dealer receives a letter from Buyer stating, “Sorry. You’re right. A deal’s a
deal.” The envelope contains a check for $2,000. Dealer sends the check back to
Buyer with a note stating, “Buyer: Because you backed out of our deal, I will not sell
you the handgun. //Signed// Dealer.”<br><br>
A few weeks later, Buyer learns that Dealer is offering the handgun for sale at her shop
for $20,000 because of its connection to the Civil War general. Buyer brings suit
against Dealer for breach of contract, requesting specific performance.<br><br>
